pizzalibrettoi booked a large group here for my wedding rehearsal dinner i wanted something that had a privateish area for our group but had character and good foodwe ended up booking an area downstairs with tall bar tables and stools there were also other private dining rooms you can book out as well when i was planning this it was super easy they have a 30 per person set menu that comes with an antipasto plate with appetizers and cured meats and cheeses then i could choose from their menu any pizza i wanted which they will determine the number that are made and come out based on 34 slices a person it also includes dessert which they also determined on the day but there was tons of food and lots of leftovers i could also preorder wine which was a great suggestion as then with the group people could just state white or red and it was ready to go you only pay for what you drink the servers were friendly and was really good at adjusting the price based on the number of people that did not show up i loved that the resto was able to overall just make you pay for what you eat without over charging ive never been to libretto before but love that they have unique pizza choices all that were very good my favourite was the spicy sausage pizza as opposed to the house made sausage the duck confit was good too but didnt have enough taste for me for apps they gave us a bunch of food but the most memorable was the gnocchi and we couldnt stop eating it for dessert we got the infamous tiramisu which was amazingthere is also an option for spelt crust,1.0
amazing i got a reasonable quote and they came the next day   not only did they pick up my junk but they swept up any debris around the area   very professional and friendly   will use them again for sure,1.0

just returned from a fabulous anniversary trip to las vegas we booked a fountain view room at the bellagio and we were not disappointed the lady at check in asked if we had a preference for floor and we told her to give us the best in her opinion so we were placed on the 28th floor the elevators are a thrill ride lol zoooom we walked in the room and wow the eiffel tower at the paris and the entire fountain area like a postcard best room i have every had in vegas comfy bed and pillows very clean and fully stocked but pricey mini bar lol but vending and ice was just up the hall casino was fun better class of folks for the most part but still a party atmosphere actually didnt do too bad and came home with winnings we do tip well so we had some really good bell  valet service really not sure why anyone would complain unless nothing pleases them it was one of the best experiences i have had traveling and the place is just gorgeous the flowers alone are worth the visit the resort is not for folks who want to get stupid and loud head to hard rock if thats your thing it does have that high end elegance that many casinos and hotels are missing in townalso if you love high end shopping  even if its just the window variety you can spend a day inside and around the resort its located in a fun spot on the strip the money they didnt get at slots i spent at giardini for beautiful italian ceramics better than a cheap tshirt lolthen there is jean phillipes patisserie with the giant chocolate fountain not just decadent sweets but great panini and crepes for lunch and we made it our go to for coffee and brioche for breakfast grab something and go sit by the pool with the paper  only for guests awesome dinner on your checklist we chose le cirque at the bellagio  if french food is your thingand you like to dress to impress its one of the best the service was amazing the decor  the plates were wonderful and the food gourmet they helped me arrange a surprise for our anniversary and presented the table with a beautiful cake from jean phillipes in our anniversary colors 5 star to their whole teami cant wait to return again,1.0

at first glance ecletica home seemed to be overwhelming but upon walking in you are greeted cheerfully and offered help and told about any sales or specials going on the windchimes in the front are gorgeous and there are so many different things if you really take the time to look you could be in each room a while the best part is they have new stuff added all the time they arent a brand new store they do consignment but also have some new but hey one mans trash might be anothers treasure i love the vases i bought and the entryway table all around great experience,1.0

i am big on food safety and when i see food safety violations especially when someone else is cooking my food i feel propelled to say something i stopped by here and placed my order the female taking my order called another employee over who was on the line cooking the food to help her with a cash register issue the employee stop making the food walked over and started handling the money and pressing buttons on the cash register i ordered through the drive through so i can see how nasty the monitor was on the cash register the female that finished handling the cash register issues went back to make the food without exchanging gloves i said something immediately and to my surprise the original cashier clerk defended her action as if she was scared to correct her this happens in the workplace a lot people see others violating rules and dont say anything to keep the peace i was sooo mad i told the cashier forget it i dont want this food and drove off not even negotiating my refund i have eaten here many of time and had great experiences i just had to post this so the whomever is in charge can round up the employees and remind them about food safety and not be to lazy to wash their hands or change gloves when touching other things away from the food prepping line customers are watching,0.0

not sure why there are so many negative reviews here let me point out a few things that matter when you enter a brand store like canada goose1 the material and the offerings this brand has for winter wear is of no match to any other brand and hence the price does all the justice it comes with a 10 year warranty what else would you need2 such stores are always jam packed and its very difficult for any sales associate to handle multiple at the same time yes even if you deploy a soldier of sales men its not enough for such a store3 what they offer is promising and  they do no compromise on quality or safety when it comes to winter wear4 the sales associate luna was super sweet to us though it was the peek of season and super busy she was kind enough to answer every question and took time to explain every detail of the varieties they had at the storei do not need to recommend this brand to anyone those who own this know the worth of it it is indeed a life time investment worth every penny,1.0
this is one of my favorite restaurants  i have been there numerous times since theyve opened and the food has always been delicious and the service has been outstanding  the bruschetta board tomasos meatballs house made pasta and sauce are my go to items  the cocktails are fabulous as well  most recently i sat outside at the bar with my friend and nicole the bartender was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu  i will be back for sure,1.0
i discovered las vegas atv tours via groupon and read some of the mixed but mostly good review via trip advisor and yelp  overall it seemed like everyone was super happy with their tourcommunication is a little spotty at times but mainly because its a mom and pop kind of business and everyone works in that joint  after a tour is when these guys respond to your emails and phone calls  we signed up for the one hour tour  john picked us up from the four seasons hotel along with other folks from different hotels on the strip and we headed towards the motor speedway where they dropped us off next to the airforce base  its about a 30 mins drive to begin with i have never driven an atv before but i owned a scooter for seven years and have driven a motorcycle so i am well aware of how to dress on a moving vehicle  however a few of the gals did not  girls  be smart not stupid  wear pants and choose the morning session in the summer  its simply too hot to do this tour in the middle of the afternoon  youll die  second wear moisture wicking clothes as you will sweat and pour water all over your body  bring a light long sleeved shirt  the sun is strong and no matter how much sunscreen you apply youll be thankful for the coverage when the wind picks up and sand is blowing onto your bare arms  second wear old tennis shoes not toms not keds not sandals  again dont be an idiot you are in the desert on a 4wheeler  the pedals have metal prongs and you need protection from the heat of the enginelast bring a small backpack filled with water extra sunscreen ibuprofen kleenex ie toilet paper chapstick and a bandana  while the group gives you a water during the half time break they only bring enough water for one bottle per person  its hot outside and the heat definitely got to me  i wish i would have brought extra water and a bandana to cover my mouth from all the dirtnow onto the tour  i thought it was amazing  the guys are tatted up smoke and good ole boys  they know what they are doing  they did a great job describing what we would be doing and the hand signals to follow  they also had extra riders to round up the caboose and let the girls ride tandem in the event they were too scared to drive an atv  they warm you up with an easy start filled with small bumps and hills  as you become more comfortable with the atv  you  have the option to be more aggressive as you trust the machine over time  they definitely make it clear to do whatever you feel most comfortable with and they never make you feel stupid for taking it slow and careful  they know the area like the back of their dry tan hands and do their job wellhonestly a one hour would have sufficed for me as its hot and physically exhausting but we winded up riding two hours  im not complaining it was great fun but for a retreat recreation i am planning in september i would recommend to my older clients to perhaps consider just an hour as it is very physically demanding  also your gas is in what looks like a gear shift on your right handle bar its a lot of strain to your right hand  it doesnt work like a motorcycle  so be prepared for some terrible texting post touri winded up flying over a witchs eye and into a dune causing me to almost flip over the handlebars  i didnt but winded up jamming my right thigh into the throttle and right handlebar  it left a nasty bruise cut and whiplash but it was all worth it  the staff was great  they made sure i was ok gave me water and asked several times if i wanted to stop and go back  i assured them i was ok and while i definitely felt it the next dayand todayi am still so happy i did the tour  it was great to get out into the desert out of the strip see the jets fly above you and meet some new people i definitely would recommend this group and casey as your guide  to make this trip more enjoyable  be prepared not a dumbasslunch is provided afterwards and the team is eager to take group photos  if you are ever in vegas and looking for something different to do give them a a call and go in the morning,1.0
just ordered my pizza and i have a good feeling about it i work in the area and craved a slice of pizza so i took to the world of yelp for recommendations they have good reviews on yelp and they were just a couple miles up the road so i gave it a shot the lady at the counter has a new york or jersey accent i cant tell them apart sorry i told her it was my first time and she helped me make a decision bc im indecisive and i made my own creation she saw that i had a yelp coupon for checking in she happily took it and i just paid the difference bc i the coupon was for a free slice of cheese pizza with a drink she didnt have to accept my coupon but she did any way while writing this my pizza came out and my order was called i went up there and boy does it look good im looking at it as i type im taking my first bite i just ate half of it before continuing my review it is delicious im so lucky i found a pizza joint close to work and home the prices are low especially for the quality definitely coming here again sorry pizza trumps yelp today and im hangry,1.0

a must while visiting las vegas at the venetian resort  casinoif youre at all like me when i visit vegas its 247 nonstop  so to take a break at the breathe oxygen bar and detox its mandatory  while inhaling pure oxygen we got massages and pulse stimulation as well as aromatherapysituated right on the canal you can see the gondolas float by and hear some magical signing  this also creates a nice tranquil feelingthis is a place i always visit when in town,1.0
watch out for these guys dont give them any of your info unless your serious about an item in store they will run the hell out of your credit which if you know about credit it will drop your score of course i already had an account an they still ran my credit over 3 times seriously while i already had an established account that i was paying on without my consent to do so i complained an of course nothing was done yet my credit has inquirys on it though be careful an if possible avoid this one at az mills as everyone isnt the same so you might get better treatment at another store just not this one ill say take care,0.0

i have been on a search for good soft serve for a couple months when i found out about toms dairy freeze i was skeptical because i thought just how good can soft serve get i was wrongthe very big medium cone dipped in chocolate that i got almost brought tears to my eyes not simply because it was creamy delicious melty and amazing but because it reminded me of my childhood when i was a kid i grew up in russia we went to moscow and got a chocolate covered ice cream bar it was almost identical taste to the soft serve cone dipped in chocolate that i got at toms beware the ice cream perhaps because its real cream and not modified milk ingredient slush melts really fast the chocolate was almost falling off my cone it was so worth it though i got twist flavour but next time i am going for vanilla alone for the purity of italso their sizes are generous a medium really is a large ive seen people with a large and it is huge i recommend starting off with a small unless youre really sure you want a lot of soft servei would highly recommend toms to anyone whos looking for either good soft serve or good old fashioned ice cream in general,1.0
i read the reviews and decided we should try flipside  the reviews mentioned that they use local produce and farms  reason 1   reviews also stated how clean and delicious everything is  i made reservations because i wanted to make sure we did not have a wait    i had to call back because one person in our party was stuck in traffic  courtney was understanding and moved our reservations   we were greeted by courtney and gave us a choice of two tables  it was a great experience from the questions we had about menu to the dessert   i highly recommend this place   thank for a wonderful meal and giving us time to visit with our vip,1.0

im used to going to brunch after 1pm so i guess you really couldnt call it brunch  i had just gotten out of church when i received a phone call from my best friend w  he asked if i want to go eat at windsor  i had never been to windsor and of course i complained because i didnt think they were going to give me enough food to fill me up  remember i am a fatboy trapped in a skinny mans body  he promised i wouldnt be disappointedas we pulled up to windsor my first impression as we walked in the door was wow  i feel in love with the way the place was set up  as we sat down a friendly waitress came and took our drink and appetizer order  she brought the drinks but she never brought the appetizers  then she came back and took our order  she brought out our food but never brought out the appetizers  we asked about the appetizers and she said she was so sorry and brought over her manager  the manager told us she was sorry for the mishap and would comp our bill 1700 since they forgot to put in our appetizers  i couldnt believe this place  it was like heavenneedless to say my meal left me full and satisfied  the service was great  the atmosphere was wonderful and the staff was amazing  i think i have found my new spot every sunday afternoon after church,1.0

food was okay servers were nice but need more experience or should pay more attention to diners needs there is one white male owner helping out  every time i go to this place this person always wear a printed tshirt which  doesnt  create a warm welcoming gesture to the diners this guy should change his attire or just stay inside the kitchen sometime you get pandesal if they remember one time i ordered a bulalo the server said it doesnt come with rice because it is categorized as soup i know the place is new and will need a lot of changes and adjustments but right now i rate this place one star,0.0
another thrift store where once i enter there is no coming out empty handed love how well organized open and clean this one is dressing rooms are awesome some prices are a bit too high yet just as many and maybe more are surprisingly low  im definitely a fan and its great that they offer daily half price promotions and that the money the store earns goes toward a good cause  3 off coupon if you donate anything and a stamp card where once you fill it up you get 30 off your entire purchase recommended,1.0

this is absolutely the worst apartment complex i have ever lived in for starters the apartment building was built in the late 60s cool i like old buildings and the design of that time but that doesnt mean that everything had to still be from that time inside everything is from the 60s and 70s down to the carpets that is missing in most closets the updated tile that they where so proud to tell us about turned out to be vinyl rolled out to look like tilesthe kitchen flooring is totally coming up from the faulty dishwasher also everything just looks dirty and dingy not only is everything inside the apartment out of date but then the hallways havent seen the light of anything new for a while correction most hallways the main lobbies have just been freshened with a new coat of trim paintwent from dingy blue to some type of aqua green stuff that looks like the 80s meet the 70s and decided miami needed to be invited inthe worst thing of all have been the thefts from amador every package that we have had to have delivered i have had to replace almost every order we have ordered here due to the lovely neighbors helping themselves to packages left in door ways basically dont move here the only positive is the price but like they say you get what you pay for,0.0
this place is still rock solid  we ordered the garlic spareribs and were amazed at how good it was  imagine fried minced garlic that taste like mini croutons  a heaping mound of it was tossed on top of the fried ribs  ive never had anything like it  i was shoveling spoonfuls of it into my mouth,1.0
gimme some sugar has opened a dessert barbakery in henderson  it was opening day and the baked goods and treats were ready  the place appears to serve desserts coffee and wine not sandwichesbread  they dont open very early 1100 am and stay open up into the evening  it would be a nice place for a casual date conversation with friends or an after movietheatrechurch snack the owners might have come up with a nice niche for their business and hopefully it works because the desserts appear awesomethe  service was very friendly and the pastry i  had chocolate browniechocolate chip cookie were really yummy  the pastry looked like super quality stuff and from what i saw prices ranged from about 3 for cookiesbrownies to 4 for very unique macarons to about 7 for very highend cake desserts  the more pricey desserts looked big enough to share with a date spouse or significant otherthe shop has about ten tables and is nicely decorated and clean  it has a classyartsybistro feel but is mellow with cool music  its tucked away in the corner of a strip mall at 215 and stephanie but it is not hard to find,1.0

honestly this is one of my favorite places to stay i have stayed here a total of 6 times i prefer the tower rooms over the pyramid rooms mainly because of the space and the restrooms are much nicer in the tower the atmosphere here is amazing they have amazing bartenders and cocktail waitresses a few times a year they always send me free rooms which a majority of the time i use them their buffet isnt the best buffet on the strip but i think it is up there i would prefer they would serve fresh steamed crab legs instead of serving them on ice but a majority of buffets do that i do wish they had more table games especially the roulette tables a lot of the time the place isnt to packed and i love all the different restaurants they have and stores i would recommend this place to anyone staying on the strip,1.0
excellent chicken and waffles inexpensive and laid back experience friendly staff no really long wait times two people ate for under twenty dollars will be back tonight lol,1.0
to give some context i have been to many pts and many body workers ive even been a body worker scott is so far the best ive encountered do not go to scott if you want to lay on a table and get rubbed for a while its not about relaxation your body is your temple and all that but its also a machine and if the pulleys and levers are out of placesyncwhack then no amount of epsom salt and meditation is going to cure what ails ya just like how you gotta work out to get stronger you gotta work on your injuries to make them betteri spend a very large portion of my life either rock climbing or hiking somewhere to film someone else rock climbing the rest of my life is spent behind a computer seated in what is possibly the most unhealthy bodily configuration for someone with chronically tight forearms upper arms chest and back add to that some chronic elbow tendonitis or osis whatever a hectic schedule living on the road and you have a recipe for a bundle of chronic pain and limited mobilityi keep most of this crap at bay with selftherapy but that only goes so far it feels like vacuuming the kitchen floor when really it needs a mopscott is that mopin 90 minutes he took my forearm extensors to the bone gave em some active releasefrom typing my pronators are as taut as a piano string he isolated those bastards and gave em what for the back neck and shoulder work was incredible as i could open my chest afterwardwhich is rare for those of us with hypertrophied backs who rarely use our pushing musclesif im in town long enough im going back,0.0
biaggio joins bo from yi mei champion deli on the list of the absolute nicest owners you could ever meet people like biaggio are the precise reason why we need to support our local businesses great food personal service owners who arent happy until youre happyit was new years day and my friend and i were looking for a place to watch the rose bowl i called biaggios to make sure theyd be open and he said theyd switch the channel to whatever we wanted to watchwhen we got there biaggio somehow recognized me from yelp he knew i was the one who ended up backing out of the cmye wow for someone who claims to not be all that internetsavvy he sure does keep a finger on the pulse of social medialong story short my friend ordered an italian stromboli and i had a pastrami stromboli we didnt realize how huge they would be so we added some garlic knots for good measure the garlic knots were extremely moist and doughy on the inside and theyre huge but nowhere near as huge as the strombolis even with a 3hour game there was no way wed be able to eat all that food oh and yes the strombolis were all they were hyped up to be i personally like the pastrami over the italian and my friend concurs so deliciouswith our strombolis only half eaten the food coma was setting in and we decided to leave at half time biaggio stops us and says we have some fried dough on the way um ok how can you turn down free food from such a generous man of course the fried dough was awesome its basically pizza dough topped with butter cinnamon and powdered sugar it smelled really sweet but it was surprisingly mellow we had a few pieces and added the rest to our togo boxesit goes without saying that ill be coming back i need to try the chicken wings that everyone is raving about also when i mentioned that my boss loves pastrami he offered to send us a pastrami stromboli when i return to work on monday now that is the epitome of generosity ill be sure to supplement that with my own order of chicken wings5 stars,1.0

today was our first trip to zipps in phoenix  we used to go to the one in scottsdale on a weekly basis but they have been doing really bad on their health inspections  i ordered a beer and appetizer at 450  by 552 we still havent seen our server to order dinner  i had to walk up to the bar to get another beer  the server stopped by to take our order at 600  its 653 and she hasnt been back  this will be our last trip to zipps,0.0

pullman is a place you have to choose to go its not on the way to anywhere and its not close to anything else particularly consequently it took me a long time to get round to going but i loved itthe decor is chic and comfortable but not pretentious in any way it attracts an eclectic clientele with a wide range of ages the music is present and reasonably loud but not so you have to shout or even pay much attention to it i really cant remember what was playing its the sort of place you can dress up to go but at the same time you wont feel underdressed in jeans i wouldnt go in sports clothes though my only concern was that it is a tad on the dark side which makes it difficult to read the tinyprinted menu when youre over 40 the tapasstyle food offerings are top quality i tried the gravlax the beet and feta salad served together the charcuterie platter and the beans in truffle oil also served together which made for great marriages there was plenty for twoi had a yen for pinot noir but was struggling with the very long wine list the servers are billed as sommeliers and definitely seem to know their wines ours suggested one id been hesitating over but it turned out to be unavailable she offered an excellent substitute at an even better price so we ended up having two bottles i dont know why it took me so long to get here i think i feared it would be pretentious and disappointing but honestly i found it exactly the sort of place ive been looking for for a while,1.0
we had the tasting menu and it was a feast we spent the next day biking to burn all the calories everything was delicious flavourful and delicately spiced it was an effort afterwards to try to pick a favourite but the kibbe nayye was a contender often with a tasting menu the dessert is an afterthought and not really worth it so we were pleasantly surprised that the kunefa  a sweet cheese pastry was so good our host was second generation syrian and was a delight his wit and explanations added greatly to our enjoyment of the evening would heartily recommend this restaurant,1.0
i played ocotillo a couple of years ago and it was very nicewell maintained interesting track and nice people i played it today and was astounded at how far the course had deteriorated i expected some issues with course conditions because of overseeding but they had also ripped up all the irrigation system and there were bare spots all over the fairways the tee boxes were beat up and the greens were bumpy and inconsistent speeds all that and i still had to pay 55 i probably wont go backtoo many other nice courses in the area,0.0
pathetic and terrible is the only way to describe my experience waitress was condescending and very inappropriate  manager finally resolved simple service issue but explained he was stepping over his superiors instructions over a simple 600 issue i was disappointed to see i could not contact higher authority through web site to share an experience that would upset any owner being a ceo myself,0.0

i bought a groupon a while back and was very excited to use it but unfortunately it expired before i had a chance to use it i was very lucky that one of the workers came into my work and we got onto the topic of the business she works for and was super sweet to give me some passes to try them out a few months later i decided to give it a try and was very happy i did when i got inside i filled out paperwork and we got started on a consultation the manager mariana was nothing but amazing with me the whole time talking me through every step she directed me first to the hydration system where it steams your body for about 20 minutes prior to that i bought into a stretch mark cream to put on before that way when the steam is opening my pores the cream can insert and help treat my recent marks first impression would be relaxing after the 20 minutes your body feels very hydrated therefore it was worth itthen we moved over to the red light therapy where the light helps with the overall health of your skin it penetrates and helps with fine lines wrinkles stretch marks and even collagen although i havent seen very much of a result quite yet i do believe her when she says it would take multiple sessions to really improve your overall skin next i had an automated massage which was all deep tissue and at the same time was having another light therapy on my face and neck she had me apply a cream for my acne which i chose and it the light helped the cream soak into my skin now the day i went in i came in with no makeup overall redness large pores and tons of acne on my chin when i woke up the next day i noticed more than half of that was gone i was amazed because the cream and light therapy really did improve my face a ton and i would definitely be back to do that one again at the very end we decided it would be a good idea to try a spray tan for the first time because the hydration station helped hydrate my skin and with that if your skin was dry the color wouldnt absorb properly and you would probably result patchy it evenly distributed all over my body and next time might want to go a shade darker now that i know what to expect overall experience mariana was amazing and very easy to talk to through the process and i was really excited she was there to help me out and makes sure i was comfortable ill be back,1.0

i had wanted to try long wongs for quite some time tonight was the night we pulled in and it was busy which was expected for a friday night we walked in and i was overhwlemed by all of the menu items choices we settled on two dozen wings garlic parm and some  type of spicy bbq a mushroom burger and a western bacon cheeseburger the burgers were 5 each which also included french fries i believe our total was about 26 for all items we decided to dine in and quickly grabbed a table because they were almost full there is tons of interesting decore that reminded me that i was in a antique shop we sat near the bathroom that is right by the front ordering counter there is package station for leftovers which was helpful because they were busy with customers the whole time we were there there is also hot sauce and ketchup bottles at the station a few arcade games and a flat screen tv in the back and a few trivia card games on a few of the tablesthe food came out to our table quickly the wings were plump and flavorful finally we found some wings that didnt skimp on the meat the wings came with sides of ranch and carrot sticks the burgers were awesome the french fries were soooo tasty i love this place and will be returning in the future recapgreat foodreasonable pricespolite employeesbusy but worth itwriting this review is making me hungry,1.0

i was at the club the other morning grooming myself after my workout you know much like lions and monkeyspicking off the tics and lice smoothing my fur using saliva etc and i thought to myself i need a haircutbtw if i can just digress for a momenti see things at the club that no person should ever be subjected tothis particular morning was no differentan 85 year old grandpa jones look alike standing naked at one of the sinks one leg up on the counter and shaving himself in places that i had trouble believing that anyone other him would care aboutyou just cant unsee that kind of thingif that describes youplease for the love of godgo into a shower stall or somethingi was blinded from seeing this and i spent the next twenty minutes stumbling along asking for someone to just put me out of my misery before i managed to grope my way into a shower and boil myselfanywayi still needed a haircutor i needed to reform my band from 1970we played a very ragged version of house of the rising sunand thats about all we playedthese days my choice for sartorial reconstruction is vs barber shopi used to go to great clips but vs  has won me back and won me back for goodthis location is everything i want in a great barber shopa manly experience that simply cannot be duplicated at a salonnowhere near enough testosterone in any saloneven the unisex super clips and great cutsthats not the case at vsits all testosterone all the timethe barbers are all barbersthey may be stylists too but first and foremost they are barbersthey know how to cut hair for men and they know how to chat with guys like the great barbers i used to frequent in san francisco and portlandlots of sports to talk about and flat panel tvs with espn on at every station plenty of magazines to read while im waiting for my call to action and not a cosmo or vogue in sight and tons of wood paneling and manly smells i mean witch hazel talcum powder etcnot pull my finger manly smellsand most importantly they cut my hair correctlyall of the barbers and any of the barbers at vs do a good jobthey cut my hair rightas right as my poor misshapen head will allowthats important to me because as i might have mentioned before im not a classically handsome manim a little bit quirky lookingand a decent haircut helpsim pretty sure that a good haircut is the only thing that keeps the beautiful carin from second guessing herself and the possibly drunken decision making that led her to select me as her husband no one ever believes that she proposed to mei cant believe it myselfbut that was a great haircut that i was sporting that day so im back at vs and im happy to swing by and get my ears lowered a colloquialism that i suppose is lost in the mists of time and talk football and golf and chicks and other guy stuff with my buddies at vsand if you need one there are even post or prehaircut cocktails available next door at the arcadia tavernand believe me sometimes quite a bit of alcohol is required to forget the horrors ive seen in the locker room at the villageinvoluntary shudder,1.0

i used empire to install tile in my small townhouse in october 2016 the tech was supposed to finish the job in 34 days it took him about 10 days to finish and when he finally did the quality was horrible huge gaps and cracks in grout when i told a supervisor about my complaints they sent the same tech out to fix it and surprise surprise he did a terrible job repairing his initial errors finally in december the company sent a new tech to fix my stillflawed floors the new tech ended up having to retile the master bathroom from scratch because it wasnt laid and set properly i was very disappointed with empire and will not be using them in the future i also would not recommend this company to anyone looking to purchase new floors,0.0
this place has a great patio and is well located near a large park so very pleasant to sit there the service was friendly but slow and unresponsivehowever the food is utterly and absolutely disgusting went there with my whole family for a saturday brunch ordered smoked salmon eggs benedict waffles veggie burger and a bunch of other stuff it was barely edible eggs served on some sickeningly off colour and mushy potato roti type thing with overaged spinach veggie burger burns your mouth way overspiced waffles soggy on the bottom from sucking some kind of liquid and dried out on top etc etcbottom line if you go there stick to drinks  although they also managed to serve lemonade without ice so lukewarm they just dont bother putting any kind of effort with the food probably because they know they will get customers regardless because of the patio and location alone it would be a perfect candidate for one of those restaurant makeover shows where the tv personality yells at the chefs and owners for being lazy or incompetent,1.0

my wife and i come here once a month when the budget permits us  having grown up in a bbq restaurant in alabama i must say this is the best bbq west of the mississippi  i personally enjoy the 13 rack of ribs with brisket and 2 sides i have never been a fan of potato salad that being said bryans has the most amazing potato salad i have ever had  the bbq beans are also very good and a little spicy  the best side choice for me is the slaw  ribs are always smoked to perfection here  when we place our order we make sure to place a togo as well usually always chopped brisket 1lb  the prices for food are well worth it the drive is definitely worth it knowing that ill be back for more worth it every time,1.0

two words chopped saladdont even bother looking at the menu order this gem you wont be disappointed in the slightest when i first arrived and had seen the reviews i was tempted to try the tacos or burger uh no the chopped salad is where its at and rightfully how the gladly has its fame ask the wait staff to mix it for you and youll see just how intricately the ingredients blend together every piece is crucial to the overall taste i recommend ordering it with avocado as that definitely livens things up but im sure it would be fine on its own toooh and they also serve a great arnold palmer ,1.0
these women belong in jail i went in to ask for my money back they charged me for the same service twice which was never provided  practically the first words out of the owner were call 911  yeai was overcharged asked for my money back and have been being harassed from this company ever since  they are claiming that i am lying about how many times i have even been there  when in fact their own stylists are lying about how many times they have donescrewed up my hair and are reporting it differently or not at all in their computers  the first stylist i saw there was lenabad haircut  i came in for it to be fixed by the most experienced person they had which is what i had requested initially but they decided to give me lena with only 3 yrs experience  after most experienced sarah had fixed my haircut i decided to let sarah do another cut and also dye my hair  bad choice  i would have never had sarah do my cut or dye again after the first screw up but instead of just giving me my money back like i requested they insisted on fixing it  and she did so again the 2nd time and again the 3rd time  she is the teacher there so this is why i allowed it to be her to try to fix it instead of obviously going with a different stylist but since sarah is the teacher there i figured i was getting the best they had to offeryikes  i am obviously the idiot for assuming they actually knew how to do hair in any way at this saloni take responsibility for being the idiot im too nice for allowing them to push me around instead of just refunding my money like i requested the first second and third times  but now they took it too far  they are stealing my 210 never provided the service they have now charged me twice for and on top of that they are threatening me with lawsuits and wasting taxpayers money calling 911 for no reason other than to cover up their own ugly business practices  secrets hair salon is horriblle  i actually have it all written down in my calendar  on my head however not one of these women will even listen to or try to help meinstead they just called 911  the manager luann with the full support of her ownerevil threatened me on a voicemail that they would attempt to get their lawyers involved because i left a comment on facebook so others will know that these women will not only screw up your hair and steal your money afterward they are threatening your civil rights  freedom of speech honesty  integrity do not even exist in this salon  and they actually did call the cops on me and i had to talk to 2 cops when i showed up just for proof of where in their computers it says i have only seen sarah 2 times  when i have in reality seen her 4 times 1 fix haircut after lena originally screwed it up  3 bad haircutsdye jobs  here r the dates 212 bad haircut and dye job from sarah 219 sarah was supposed to fix instead yet another bad haircut and dye job from sarah 412 sarah was supposed to fix but received yet another bad haircut  dye job from sarah  of course i was charged the 100 65 dye  35 cut the first time sarah did cut and dye 212 but for some reason she charged me another 110 dye  cut  10 gloss on 412 but that was supposed to fix the crap cut and color she had given me the first and second times  now the top half of my head is brassy orange with bright neon yellow patcheshighlights   the rest of my hair is an ugly orange brown   i used to receive compliments on my hair everywhere i went until i started coming to this salon now everyone i see says its not toooo bad  i have seriously gotten the exact same haircut at great clips  walmart  save your money  and your sanity  they leave voicemails on my phone 10 times in a row after 7 pm harass me threaten me call the cops on me try to have me arrested for trespassing when i show up to their business both to explain how they are mistaken and for proof of the fallacies they are spuing but they all just want to be thieving liars and not help anyone but themselves   secrets hair salon is botched,0.0
astonishingly mediocre alas this experience was everything i dislike about corporate restaurantsunenthusiastic employees following a script slow and incompetent service uninspiring foodwhile i understand that a party of 9 is a large group the restaurant wasnt busy during our time there at lunch and there seemed to be no cross service to help out our waitperson  despite being perhaps 30 full our lunches took about 25 minutes to deliver  and the order was incomplete one entree was incorrect one not delivered at all  too bad it was wings as it took another 20 minutes for them to arriveand these too were incorrect  i guess other than being part of the name wings are a difficult entree to preparethe waitperson apologized then started complaining about the kitchen stafftrue professionalism  the head host who introduced herself as we sat and left a flyer with us never came by to apologizedespite us being obviously ready to go after over an hour there the waitperson had to go back and finalize the bill which was incorrect  we were charged for the delayed and incorrect wings but were not charged for the incorrect salad entree  that would somewhat make sense but it was not mentioned by the waitperson so i dont know if it was a mistake or intentionally complimentarymy entree was entirely forgettable indeed a few days later i have no recollection of what it was  i do recall that the onion rings were soggy and greasythe two word review  why bother,0.0

i came to las vegas in march looking for a place for my husband and i to live debbie bird real estate agent showed me the property at bella vista when i first saw it i really liked it because the appliance matched it was enough room for my husband and i and our 2 pets i immediately got everything in motion so i could go back east and pack i gave myself 3 days to find a place i went into remax central on saharaand met tobie tobie went over the lease i told her my husband and cat will come later has he was finishing up things back east the rent was 699 i paid a pet deposit of 300 for my pom among other fees i told tobie  my husband and cat will be here later on in the year she said as soon as they get here we will have to pay another pet deposit for the cat no problem tobie and i agreed on that i left las vegas with the lease stating 699 a month i signed a year lease gave money for a year lease i signed the lease in march i did not move in until may18  in the middle of april i get an email from someone name laurine huynh from remax central stating that i will have to pay for my cat before i get there i wrote back and told her tobie and i agreed that when my husband and cat get to las vegas just come into remax and pay another pet depositlaurine huynh very nasty person said tobie is not a leasing agent she filled in for her because she was on pregnancy leave i said well how was i suppose to know what position tobie is and did not know who  laurine is i have never heard of youfirst i thought it was a scam so i wrote tobie she said laurine is the leasing manager i talked to laurine and told her tobie and i had an agreement i signed a lease with tobie not with you i also stated to her so everything tobie said was a lie her words were thats not what i am saying i said yes it is because if it was not then why are you telling me something totally different from what tobie and i discussed in march and a lease i already signedi left las vegas thinking the rent was 699it changed to i had to pay for my cat deposit right at that moment even though i did not know when my husband and cat would be here  another fee came up 50 extra a month for my husband and cat i said for my husband and cat are you kidding me she wrote back and said because you are adding extra people what extra people how is my husband an extra person this is a 2 bedroom 1 bath condoon the application said will except pets 2 maximum i had already agreed to pay a security deposit for my cat even though i did not know when they would be there then another total came up she said i would have to pay extra 75 for an extra inspection what the lease i signed with tobie already said it was going to be inspection every 3 months which was no extra money to me so i have to pay for extra inspection for what month they were already going to inspect it every 3 months so basically she was trying to make me pay for inspection that was already in the leasejohn and ruth ahlbrand is the owner of that remax on 8400 w sahara so i received in my email something that wanted me to give them my automatic signaturei never signed that but i did sign for extra fee for 50 more a month for rent for as they sated extra people i could have said no but that would have meant i would have to come back to las vegas and start over laurine even said i could pay the extra 50 for the whole year if i wanted to i said no i will pay it monthlythey already had a year worth of rent from me and now they were going to have 50 more a month for my husband and cat they thought they was going to get that 75 for an extra inspection which i fought not to give when i got here in may2014 the air condition was broke i spent 3 hot days in that apartment i have high blood pressure heart failure and i am disabled the microwave was filthy underneath the refrigerator was not cold they had to replace all of that she talked about me paying for that old nasty microwave but they realized it was old and nasty underneath the vent i guess i was so relieved to get a place i was only in town for 3 days i really did not look underneath the microwavederek the repair man extremely nice had to replace the bulb in the stove when he pulled the stove out omg there was dog food dirt a dog toyand a lot of food crumbs everything was wrong got fixed or replaced but not without the attitude of remaxi never hung anything on the walls while we lived there i did not want them try and nickle and dime us when we moved which was this year long year in that apartment we hired maria house cleaning service to clean and that place looked cleaner after we left than before the stove had so many marks on it i thought it was part of the stove being everything was old except of the cabinets the cabinets were changed over in all the apartments when they changed to condos beware they will nickle and dime you,0.0

remember what eau claire used to be like it was a bustling community space with artists musicians and a diverse community of people enjoying their day cafe blanca reignites this community focus in the eau claire area  this time with a focus on coffeethey love coffee they love coffee more than you love coffee you might have thought you loved coffee but they take it to a level that honestly you probably wont every care to know this is good because the result of which for your average coffee loving joe is a very delicious cup of joetheres a few kind of seating arrangements whether youre looking for a quick bite or looking to get social with some friends a date and interview or cozy up and get social online with your email in a corner somewhere its a good space if you need some focus time because its somewhat quiet right now but its really quite great so if this review has anything to do with it i hope to see a little more bustle in the near future if youre looking at staying even a little longer theres a detached back room complete with tv if you wanted to host a large meeting or some boardgames if you feel like hanging out next to the sunny windowsthe food is fresh tasting and quite healthy as coffee shops become a big part of my work day its nice to be able to find a meal that is both tastes good and is healthy at the same timea very welcome addition to the eau claire area make sure you make this your summer bike path ride coffee stop,1.0

my first trip to the mirage was a great one the hotel and casino are beautiful and fairly easy to navigate which is saying something for vegas which has famously confusing casino floors we had an excellent experience with the front desk staff  luis was extremely professional and helpful for us in securing our room upgrade our room was amazing and the housekeeping staff did a great job there is a lot to do on site at the mirage the mirage volcano which underwent a 25 million upgrade i believe was brand new to us on this trip  the past times we had been it was under construction definitely do not miss this the pool at the mirage was awesome although nothing too different from most resort pools i have been to the paradise cafe located by the pool had great service and food its not advertised but the sigfried and roy tiger habitat offers a 3 per ticket discount to mirage hotel guests if you show your room key we gladly took advantage of this and enjoyed seeing all the animals the beatles revolution lounge located just off the casino has a really cool ambiance and atmosphere but 9 for a heineken bottle is a bit excessive we loved the beatles love cirque du soleil gift shop  sadly we could not get tickets for the show so we spent a good amount of money in the gift shop buying souvenirs insteadone downside to staying at the mirage is the 20day resort fee and additional tax that is charged not only on the room but the resort fee as well to their credit they are up front about the resort fee  it was not hidden we were well aware of its existence before we booked our room,1.0

most people in cleveland are acquainted with aladdins for a quick lunch or dinner of lebanese food however if youre looking for a nicer dinner with a great atmosphere tazas is your place they make their own fresh pita playfully names puffy pita by some served with olive oil and zataar id highly recommend ordering any of the meat products as they are each grilled to perfection on what must be a wood fire grill my favorite plate is the lamb plate that can be ordered in two sizes depending how much meat you want i recommend eating it with the garlic sauce the perfect wine pairing is the red adyar wine this wine is made in lebanon and can only be found at tazas or aladdins,1.0

my friend and i were visiting toronto this past weekend and after a long day of walking around the city we decided to grab some sushi to snack on before heading back to the hotel to rest and get ready for proper dinnerwe settled on kokyo after passing by a couple other restaurants a very nice waitress greeted us at the front door and we were seated in the outdoor patio area the plastic lawn chairs were scuffed and old looking there was duct tape around the outer edge of all the tables to hide chips and cracks who knows we ordered 4 rolls spicy tuna with tempura flakes cucumber salmon and honolulu the prices were pretty cheap compared to the sushi place we frequent in our hometown so we thought we were getting a deal when the rolls came out my first thought was holy sht i hope we dont get food poisoning from this i dont know if it was the chefs first day out of school or what but they were the sloppiest looking rolls weve ever seen they looked like they were falling apart and the pieces were sliced so huge it was almost impossible to eat them in one bite you could either try to shove the whole thing in your mouth and hope you could chew it enough to swallow or try to take two bites which effectively destroyed the piece and made a mess i settled on taking two bites each dealing with the mess to avoid chokingas for the taste it was meh we are really spoiled when it comes to sushi our local sushi place consistently puts out exceptional food the cucumber roll was just a huge chunk of cuke surrounded by rice so its hard to go wrong there the honolulu roll was good but the avocado had some brown spots on it the spicy tuna roll tasted just the slightest bit off it looked fairly unappetizing which probably colored our opinion i liked the texture of the tempura flakes though the salmon roll was also ok we left several pieces on the plate we just didnt want to finish themthoughout dinner there was one particularly agressive fly that would not leave me alone and little birds hopping around the patio not very relaxing when youre trying to eat overall i would say skip this place im sure you can do better,0.0

my adult kids husband and i came to this business because were referred by a friend  i explained to the manager shelly and another employee that we were under a major time restraint  after telling them our background and situation they said we were solid renters and wouldnt have any trouble finding us a place  the employee seemed very disorganized and showed us one place after being there for almost half a day he said he would call the next day with other places to show us  i never received a call back so i called the manager explaining to her our time constraint and asked for a more aggressive person  she had nothing but excuses and sounded like she just wanted to get me off the phone before stating that she would check my file and call back  i have yet to receive that callif youre in any kind of hurry or expect organization and timely call backs this is not the place to go,0.0
i purchased an amazon local deal for a 3 hr cleaning and shortly before it expired i called to schedule the cleaning since the coupon was set to expire in 3 days linda was unwilling to honor the coupon value because the actual service was set to take place after the expiration date i have had all other companies honor the promotional value if the service was scheduled prior to the expiration date however linda was completely unwilling to show any flexibility on this and only agreed to provide 1 hr of service as required for the 49 i paid for the coupon her reasoning was policy however as the owner of her own company that excuse does not carry much weight as she has the authority to do as she pleases and she obviously chose not to be flexible here she maintained a pleasant tone throughout our conversation however the entire interaction left me feeling very frustrated i will not be using her services at all for future cleaning due to this experience,0.0

i went to this place for a few months and quit taking my 25 year old there because that place is more concerned about money than helping with the care of your child tami is very difficult to deal with and even after months of going there she was never nice or willing to work with me and my husbands inconsistant schedules i was overcharged on multiple occasions my son didnt learn anything from this place the place is a rip off,0.0

interesting decor colorful clean  it had been about 40 years since we ate at osf  staff are efficient friendly and reasonably attentive but the food is not good  it has nothing to do with the chef but probably the recipes  not good flavors not what you would expect from traditional plates you have eaten elsewhere  we had lasagna poor or lack of flavor and chicken alfredo almost tasteless and the chicken was grisly i did well to have eaten a third of it because i was extremely hungry  lots of salt and pepper couldnt pick it up  i will never return there are too many good places to eat here in the phoenix area,0.0

do not stay hereim writing this as i sit extremely grossed out in my hotel room here at the travelodge we checked in on monday evening where our room seemed fine enough for what we paid sure it isnt the cleanest but for 30 something dollars a night you cant be too picky we unpacked everything that we had for our seven night stay when we realized there was no key to our in room safe we called the front desk and they offered to move us right then we moved to a room two doors down and packed and unpacked all of our things yet again the next day we found a small cockroach in the bathroom and a few moments later a very large cockroach climbing up the wall above our bed we went down to the front desk to show them what we just came across and they didnt even bat an eye that was extremely disturbing to me that both women working did not seem the least bit alarmed at the sight of two cockroaches found in their hotel they offered us yet another room but we were on our way out to a pool party and were already running late so we moved to our third room later that evening packed up all of our things again and moved them all upstairs we got through the next day without a cockroach sighting in our new room up until just now i went into the bathroom and there was a giant one sitting on my tooth brush i would be leaving but its an extremely busy weekend here in vegas and everything is either booked or too pricey each time i try to contact a manager about our ongoing issue she isnt in very disappointed in spending my vacation here it has been a headache and a disaster save yourself the trouble and pick somewhere else ive had a good experience at circus circus manor lodge which is not too much more expensive,0.0

if i could give zero stars i would i wonder if the people making the decisions try sleeping here the beds are uncomfortable the pillows are worse the walls are so thin i can literally hear the people above us chewing gum i asked for an accessible room she said it was a king suite only the bed was a miniature double certainly not big enough for two people and the only thing that made it accessible was a handheld shower head i called to ask for a different room and the phone doesnt work although its a suite there are no glasses its 9am and 20 degrees but the guy is skimming the pool not only that hes singing and i can hear him as if hes standing next to me if i wasnt getting up to be gone until after midnight wed be changing hotels it also appears that people live here for some have a lot of crap in the windows as if they have been here awhile,0.0
i have had 2 fabulous experiences with dr hart and her staff the first was for a bonding repair in august and the second was for an xray review before my teeth cleaning in november  the equipment is modern and they walk you through the whole process the office is clean and comfortable the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable  my dental hygienist was very thorough and explained the whole process they give you an estimated statement that you sign before completing any proceduretaking the guess work out completely really the whole staff is very pleasant and i enjoy going there very much,1.0
the food is good but not worth the bad service when they get your order wrong my order was wrong  instead of being apologetic  replacing it they only replaced half the order  after waiting 45min for the driver  i called back  requested my money back  once the driver arrived he told me i would either get a refund or my food not both also was very rude about it  it was only after convincing him to call the manager who approved the refund he said very rudely heres your 9 and took off  only visit this poor excuse of a food joint if you want rude service if they mess up your order,0.0

i would give this company no stars for this review if i could the technician named jesse solicited us over the phone asking us if we needed windshield glass repair we did so we agreed to go with his company because he promised us we would receive a 100 check back after we had our windshield replaced that was about a month ago and we never got the check i called and spoke to the sales manager named jeremy who was a complete sleazeball he lied through his teeth saying jesse was a new tech and they never offer 100 checks only 100 restaurant coupons he didnt offer to fix it and issue the check as promised he didnt say he would correct jesse and tell him to stop lying to customers he just wanted me off the phone he must get complaints all day because he knew exactly what he wanted to say and couldnt care less that we were lied to dont use this company fyithey also operate under the name glass service centeri plan to file a compliant with the bbb and the arizona  consumer fraud division they need to be held accountable for their promised lies,0.0

do not go here the manager is a complete moron like united airlines they overbooked and then randomly or deliberately deny people entry despite sending a confirmation email confirming the reservation the manager is an overweight rude guy i explained to him that i had my reservation yet the guy didnt even let me complete my sentences talked over me and was rude he kept saying i called you to tell you we are overbooked as soon as you reserved the table well he called me 30 minutes after my reservation was confirmed its completely unacceptable to cancel someones reservation thats why you make the reservation in the first place remember the sienfeld episode btw i think if theyre overbooked theyre more likely to reject you if your name does not sound caucasian its the colonial mentality,0.0

went here the other day with my sister i admit i wasnt expecting much when i first got there i thought it would be like all the other asian froyoice cream places in town but i was so wrong the snow ice is so fluffly upon first glance you might think it to be just plain old ice cream but when you scoop it up and eat it you can immediately tell the difference it has a very light almost shredded type of texture like confetti i got the taro flavor with red bean strawberry and mochi it was very light and i didnt feel full after i ate it and it wasnt overly sweet i will definitely be coming back with my friends,1.0

i hope this doesnt sound corny patronizing or worst racist but i want to talk about the atmosphere of this place in some wonderful family restaurants run by new american families who have come from elsewhere you feel like you are getting the delicious authentic food but in an americanized setting like a strip mall or lower rent neighborhood where they havent had time or money to try to make it more like home or show off their culture  i can totally appreciate and go with that and often actually prefer it because its the food and flavor that matter to me in phoenix this is true of khyber halal and da vang for example although they each share with patrons some few homey icons i find lovely rugs shrine respectively   other restaurants try harder on the decor and lighting and its a miss because you feel theyve kind of thrown up some predictable version of what americans expect for their countrys style a la chinese buffet with jello at american truckstop actually im rarely a fan of restaurant ambiance kind of dislike it mostly especially when i feel im being courted marketed with that instead of the food  i suppose the idea is to blend an impression on multiple senses to make dining an experience but i have found it much more accessible and enjoyable when its not staged for me quite so obviously as it is at cool concept restaurants not that i dont like some of them  i think it mostly doesnt work even in beautiful settings because the best eating experiences to me are intimate even openhearted and its hard to achieve intimate when you are big and successful  which reminds me i need to review august in new orleans for gifting me brioche for breakfast after an incredible dinner when i was agonizing over what i had to forego in the face of so much lusciousness to choose fromwith that preamble id like to say that the atmosphere the deep colors the lighting i dont knowthe feeling of reathrey sekong from its strangetomyears name to the amount of space inside the tiny room dedicated to a sofa setting of furniture is kind of wonderful  ok im going to say it poetic  its gently happy and softly lit and just well  put together   kind of a perfect smile on the solo server pretty food a menu that is charmingly written  examples serving intestines and asking if youve got the guts and come on who couldnt love student noodles  and yes as everyone else here has said its delicious  thank you to the owners and staff  ill be back,1.0

pricing is way to high ask how much it would cost was told 160 when i went to pick it up it was 316 when asked i was told they quoted me for the part only i know i did not ask what the part costs i only want to know what the job costs had i known i would not have had the work done since i new i could get the part online for 60 and an easy install located right on top of the motor easy access 2 screws and a plug maybe a 10 minute job they charged me for 1 hour  125 and where do they come up with shop supplies of 17 couldnt have used more than one wrench i think i paid for that wrench a few times after all that it didnt fix the problem i did not need that part and they diagnosed it they dont deserve any stars because all they did was waste my time and moneythis is the second time they did this to me last year they put a part in my bronco that it didnt need for 280 when i went back and told them it didnt fix the problem i was told i didnt explain the problem properly,0.0

worst customer service experience i will say i dont normally go to this location but i had a dr appt and it was close by i went through the drive thru and ordered a sliced turkey breakfast sandwich the woman didnt seem to understand what i wanted but said to come to the window i paid for the sandwich and looked at my receipt and noticed they rang up something else the girl at the window hands me my sandwich and i can tell the bag is a lot heavier than it should be i look at the wrapping and can tell it is not what i ordered i hand it back and say i wanted the sliced turkey sandwich and the girl hands it back to her co workers she explains to them what i asked for and i can hear the employees arguing over what it is that i want and how to make this sandwich instead of clarifying with me what is it that i want they make another wrong sandwich and i finally say i wanted a refund because 10 minutes had passed since i arrived to the dunkin donuts in the background i hear more conversation from the employees saying this isnt starbucks and you cant order secret menu items with the manager kathy standing there with them kathy comes to the window and says its not a menu item they carry which is fine had they explained that from the get go the reason i was upset was the lack of respect by the employees and the manager standing with them allowing that type of conversation to take place where i can hear i asked for kathys supervisor who she said was currently out of town and i could fill out a survey if i was dissatisfied i will never go back to dunkin donuts i am absolutely disgusted with how i was treated and how this manager couldnt handle a wrong order and let her employees say rude and disrespectful things where i could hear,0.0

ive eaten at carnevino a couple of times in the lounge area where ive ordered from the less expensive bar menu and have been thoroughly impressed they have a better fancy burger than bradley ogden if you ask me so my husband and i decided to eat in the dining room for our first anniversary on sunday the understated decor is reminiscent of a simple yet sophisticated italian country villa and the general aura is relaxed and welcoming every person on the wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable and the managers were gracious and accommodating because it was our anniversary we each received a complimentary glass of bastianichs own brut upon arrival normally 14 a pop but more notably because we are locals we received 15  off our entire bill i believe batali is the only chef thus far to offer such a discount on a regular basis and he should be commended for it for an appetizer we ordered the pappardelle with porcini trifolati or cooked porcini mushrooms22 porcini mushrooms are my favorite mushroom they are generally large and have a spongelike underside rather than gills giving them a kind of chewy yet slippery texture when i saw porcini i got incredibly excited because the only place i have seen fresh porcini mushrooms in the states is at the ferry building farmers market in san francisco while living in italy they could be found everywhere in the fall even at road stands and i frequently ordered this exact dish whenever i could needless to say i was truly disappointed when the dish came out full of shitakes and other varieties of mushrooms with nothing like the porcinis i know and love if the menu had just said pappardelle with mushrooms i would have been completely satisfied as the pasta was beautifully homemade and tossed in a light yet buttery sauce sadly this misrepresentation showed up more than once on the menu our spinach side was supposed to have cherry peppers to give a kick yet didnt and our spring peas with pancetta turned out to be snow peas the steak was the real showstopper of the meal i try to be frugal when dining out but as a selfproclaimed foodie i am also willing to pay big money for something novel and ridiculously good that something today was the 240 day dryaged steak that cost 100 an inch dryaging of beef is basically the controlled rotting of the exterior of the meat in a cold environment that results in the formation of a skin or pellicle that is then removed prior to cooking it is an expensive process and therefore results in better but less frugal cuts of meat most wellmarbled high grade meat is dryaged for some amount of time as it dramatically enhances and concentrates the flavor but this time can range from a few weeks to about the 240 days given the riserva steak here we were told the slaughter date for our beef was circa early august 2009 a second manager prepared it for us tableside by skillfully slicing it on a wooden board and drizzling it with the chefs recommendation of a little olive oil and a sprinkle of salt we ordered the horseradish black pepper zabaglione as an accompanying sauce but despite its ethereal qualities it was utterly unnecessary and almost felt like a sin to use on this particular piece of meat the inherent flavors of the steak were not powerful enough to stand up to it and only by eating the steak alone could you truly appreciate the process and time required to create such a masterpiece the wait staff described the flavor as earthy but for me it was as if the aroma you get when you first walk into a fabulous cheese store such as murrays in the west village found its way into the meat and then ultimately into your mouth in a subtle yet obvious way combine that with the intensely flavored juices of the best quality steak you can buy and the result is unlike anything youve had before as i continued to analyze the complexity of flavors twinkling in my mouth i looked over at my husband and saw teardrops welling in his eyes when he noticed i was looking at him he said ill cry over meat i dont give a f i was hoping he was tearing up over how happy he felt to be married to me but no it was the steak he was feeling such a fondness for i really wasnt hurt at all because i felt the same and in all fairness you cant have a steak like that everyday for the rest of your life as far as strip restaurants go i would be more inclined to come back here rather than try some of the other celebrity chef restaurants i havent yet been to usually you dont get what you pay for but i felt the prices charged here were deserved to boot the service and ambiance were top notch without being stuffy if you are looking for a special occasion place carnevino is now on my list of top ten strip restaurants for my full review go to my blog,1.0

a well maintained trail for walking running or biking the trail is actually paved with dirt trails below in several areas one could get a few miles in on this trail and make it even longer by joining up with the arroyo grande sports complex there are even scenic stop offs with picnic tableseven though the trail crosses several major roads the trail is very quiet and relaxing as it cuts through residential neighborhoods each major road has an underground path so that you dont have to cross busy roads i was glad to find this option as it seems like a much safer way to travel the path the path was free of garbage and animal waste we saw volunteers cleaning up the area close to the wash as we walked too i was glad to see that not only does the city maintain the path but the public using the trail takes pride in keeping it clean the area around the path was also prettier than i expected with green grass in areas and trees along the trail that were well cared for too,1.0
this was my first visit to this location but as many have mentioned once you have been to one chipotle youve been to them all  i went  to this location since 50 of sales went to a school fund raiser for my son  987 of the time i get the burrito bowl and this visit was no different  it was amazing like normal  i also tried their queso for the very first time and it was very good as well  it was very busy since there was a fund raiser going on but our wait in line was less than ten minutes from the time we parked until we were eating huge burrito bowls,1.0

i have to say something about this place  first of all  i pull in and as i was looking around confused looking for the front office no one came out to greet me until someone came out and said go ahead and look around the cars are open umm ok arent you going to show me or help me  fine i look around and finally the same guy comes outside and i ask what i need to qualify  and he says go apply online and we will see if we can qualify you  omg  how rude  i mean as a sales person that is your job to help me to see how i can get a car  i left immediately and went to a more professional place like bmw  where they treated me excellent and got myself a bmw without so many requirements  dont waste your time here ,0.0

we wont be going back again this is our second visit and while the first was not amazing this time was truly horrible we ordered a salad to start 3 bites into the salad and the entrees show up so much for our salad one bite of the chicken saltimbocca proved that it was made ahead or purchased and then frozen and reheated the artichoke hearts were obviously canned and tough it was awful and it was promptly returned the spaghetti and meat sauce was passable but i did not try the meatballs my daughter ordered the were so huge and dense i cant imagine they tasted good let alone the texture we ordered the chocolate lava cake and it came so dry that all we ate was the middle and the ice cream on top microwaved for sure when i confronted the manager and said that i thought he overused chef mike he knew exactly what i meant and smiled but did not deny it chef mike in the land of chefs is the mircowave a huge no no in any professional kitchen that cares at all about the quality of their food the biggest waste of 75 in recent memory stay awaychef jill miranda ames to please private cheffing,0.0
i dont get the allure of this place at all im personally not a fan of high quantity accomplished through sacrificing quality we came here because my husband wanted something unhealthy and fried but we should have used up those calories somewhere else i had the chicken and waffles and although the plate looked like a spectacle being a spectacle is not always a good thing i would only come back here if i was being dragged to it by tourists who use the moniker foodie too freely their cocktail mixes are pretty good but again more focused on looking good rather than actually tasting good if im going to eat unhealthy id rather go to raising canes bjs cheesecake factory anywhere else really,0.0

the saying  its too good to be true definitely applies here we sat through the time share talk last year and chose this location for our free weekend i got the sense there is some sort of list of those there for a free weekend as we were pretty much on the discard list while we saw many others who were seemingly  owners treated much better we booked the weekend in a suite for four guests as we told them we were with our children we drove from los angeles and after sitting in terrible traffic arrived at 11 pm our young children were exhausted after checking in we were sent to the guest services representative that held our parking permit hostage she started in with the  sell and when we explained we really needed to go upstairs as our kids were falling asleep she acted offended and said  well im not done telling you about the resort when we got to the room the living room with the pull out couch was so small we had to move all furniture to the perimeter of the room to open the bed it was not made up there were no blankets in the room none two total towels for four people every time we called down to ask for these items we had quite a long wait on our second night we came into the lobby to someone sleeping on the couch or passed out there we asked for a late check out when we arrived and were told to call back saturday night or sunday morning regular check out was 10am we called to ask for an extra hour and got a very clipped  no we will charge you 35 an hour the staff was less than accommodating and certainly did not make us feel they wanted us to purchase a time share we left feeling like we wouldnt go back to a wyndham property if you paid us it was not relaxing to hear people talking about their sale and percentages wherever we went there were no umbrellas at the pool no umbrellas at a pool in vegas there was a seedy element here and id never return,0.0

good lord i thought this was a hotel not a white trash penal colony  well ok in all fairness it is not just a white trash penal colony because it is full of trash of all races creeds and colors  but in complete honesty if the human race had a trash can it would be this dump  i am right now in a non smoking room that smells like the rugs were shampooed with chewing tobacco   or maybe i just smell it from the next room because the walls are so thin that you can hear a dog fart through them  walking through the lobby it looks like a frigging zombie movie  that movie leaving las vegas should have been filmed here because being here makes me want to drink myself to death with a hooker  there are two reasons to stay here  1  there is a blizzard coming it is unsafe to be outside and you are on foot with no shoes and youll die before you get to other shelter 2 youre trash and you want to be with the other trash  holy crap  get me out of this frigging dump,0.0

i was not pleased with the place my husband passed away just before christmas after arrangements were made and paid for i couldnt get the actual office on the phone i kept getting their answering service when i was finally called to pick up my husbands ashes they had put him in the wrong urn had his date of death wrong on the label they put on the urn they didnt even have the prayer cards ready they started printing them after i got there to pick him up i understand businesses are closed for holidays thats not even my problem my problem was they give you a card and tell you to call anytime with any questionswhen i call their answering service tells me they are closed for renovations so please call back monday  then they dont answer their phones and they dont return their callsi called six times in the next two weeks and only got the actual office one time and the guy that answered put me on hold and hung up on me  they also dont check their own paperwork before giving you the ok to pick up what you are picking up there was a copy of the urn i ordered in my husbands file they had the only thing the wrong urn had in common with the one i ordered was that it was square and made out of wood  i will never go to them again for anything they may be cheaper then most other places but there is a reason for that even after their renovations there place is still a dump the people that work there are very insensitive they deal with the dead everyday i dont i have never had to do anything like this before when i call i deserve to have my call returned if not that same day then the next morning if you can possibly pick a different place to deal with then do it this place is not worth the aggravation you have to deal with at the worst time in your life,0.0

dr carruth and staff are terrific  a sole building so no hassle with big medical buildingparking decks  information received prior to the procedure online information is excellent  seems impossible to not be prepared unless one doesnt read the information the office staff assistant pa and dr carruth explain everything without being patronizing and are respectful and professional my husband detests going to any doctor and dr carruth won him over my only unhappy part is the tv room near procedure rooms and the waiting room with a tv are the only family waiting options it would be nice to have a no tv waiting area or at least one on mute we are not tv watchers and find it irritating otherwise i understand why dr carruth was recommended to us by doctors and friends and we will certainly recommend him to others,1.0
i bought a set of tire from discount about 14 months ago for my wifes 99 sl500 when i went in this week for their rotation they told me they could not rotate the tire because the front tires were worn off on both sides below the wear points this was due to the fact that they set the air pressures to low in those tire they only had 14lbs of pressure in them and they should have been at 30lbs the tires were rates for 60k miles but they only had about 10k on them the new set they put on the rear had 24lbs in them and they looked fine  but they should have been at 35lbs discount would not stand behind their failed work they are the ones who set those pressures wrong but i could not prove that fact they tried to say the chrome on my rims was delaminating inside and that was causing them to lose pressure that was total bs because both front and back tires had matching pressures on either side  ill be finding a new tire store next time after this,0.0

35 years of patronizing robertos in san diego and in las vegas is now finished why  roberto you can thank your employees at the shop located on cactus just east of so highlands parkway in las vegas earlier this month march 2015 while waiting for my food a female employee began vigorously sweeping the entry rug located inside the front door  she swept in the direction of the condiment island and the service counter all the while oblivious to the cloud of dust she was creating in the room in a matter of seconds the entire room was engulfed in dust  it was so bad in fact that i was compelled to go outside where i could breathe not only did the dust settle on the condiment cart and its contents but it migrated into the kitchen where my food was being prepared nothing was said by any employee about the dust cloud as it lingered in the kitchen and settled on my food it was disgusting disgusting disgustingthis experience has led to my loss of confidence and trust in the cleanliness of robertos shop and the safe preparation of food at this location it has also caused me to doubt the manner in which robertos other shops are being operated hasta la vista roberto,0.0

good location my friends used to live there  but for what your paying the units are way too small and lousy carpeting very low end appliances old and poorly functioning washer and dryers and refrigerators  no storage space anywhere in the units rooms are small living rooms too small and the water and trash used to be included now they are charging their tenants a flat fee which should be illegal  its called ratio billing and their water waste due to broken and poorly functioning irrigation and sprinkler systems is not the tenants fault  the group that owns this complex also owns a few other properties in the area  my advice stay away do your homework youll be much happier in the long run  you can tell by driving through there that half the complex is vacant ask yourself why such a prime location would be 50 vacant not rocket science you probably arent getting what you pay for  the property manager while she attempts to act friendly always sounds pissed off with attitude not sure what her problem is i would probably rate it 2 or 3 stars if the units were priced appropriately for the condition and size obviously they cant make them bigger so you have to adjust prices,0.0

i am absolutely agreeing with the lady alissa m who had a terrible experience with these very unprofessional people i took my mother there as she is 89 and has terrible hot burning feet at night and gets no sleep they told her that they have a machine that has worked for others with that problem so she tried it out at their office and she bought one for 40000 it was a lot for her to pay out with such a limited income but was so hopeful that it would work after about the 3rd day her feet were worse and she was in worse shape than before she got this machine so she called them and the woman told her to use it twice a day for 30 days and she should be good so back on the machine she went and it got so bad that her feet were burning all day and all night so called the office again and the woman actually told her that if it is not working for her maybe you better put it on kijiji and try to sell it for 20000 or whatever you can get for it as we do not do refundsif you deal with these people do so at your own risk,0.0

heres my experience with naima my sister is getting married and we found a couple of makeup artist in the area we found naima and decided to do a makeup trial even though she had mixed reviews  online so we went to her studio  which is someones basement lets ignore how awkward that was and the first thing i noticed was how unorganized and messy her makeup area was it literally looked like there was an explosion makeup on top of makeup products on top of products completely unprofessional i gave her the benefit of the doubt and ignored it but then she started her makeup i noticed naima was using dirty brushes on my sister i was going to gag because it was so gross but i kept my mouth shut i was honestly worried my sister was going to break out or have some sort of skin reaction she took off the makeup immediately after leaving the trailalso noticed that naima was using low to mid drug store products she wasnt using luxury or high end products which is odd because the price she was asking for you would expect everything to be top notch anyways she did her makeup trial and it took naima 5 hours just makeup not hair even though we told her we needed to be done at a certain time because we drove almost 2 hours to get to her overall we were not impressed with the makeup look it was so standard with gold glitter and such a traditional basic desi look honest critic because i do makeup the contour was off eyebrows were overly drawn way too much eyeliner at the bottom which made eyes look sunken and winged liner was not on point  your average mac  sephora makeup artist can do better and are probably in a lower price and much more sanitary obviously we ended up not hiring her for the wedding looking at some of these reviews i think it was a good decision would not recommend her at all just my honest review,0.0

horrible experience on our last visitwe went there on a saturday evening and checked in for three haircuts this was around 510 pm there were two ladies without their name badge on both had poor customer service skills but one of them was worse rude looks snobbish attitude blunt talk not at all pleasing in personality and worse when it came to giving a haircut she was not at all accommodating and we came out disappointed infact decided not to go ahead with third haircut too never again with that lady,0.0

i went here for new years eve dinner with my parents and my fiance it was a prix fixe menu for 70 dollars that came to over 90 including tax and tipbefore wine there was one vegetarian choice per course which is expected and totally fine when it is 34 choices per course the vegetarian choices sounded good and i was really excited before going so the first course was a caprese salad with one very generous slab of buffalo mozzarella one slice of red tomato a vine tomato i think and one slice of yellow tomato the tomatoes werent great but it is winter and theyre out of season the dressing was a flavorless olive oil and thin balsamic vinegar and one leaf of basil it was okay but would have been greatly improved by smoking the tomatoes or infusing the oil or even just using a high quality flavourful olive oilor more basil or even slicing the cheese thinnersecond course was crispy ricotta gnocchi this was where it really fell apart they were battered and over cooked so it was just like hollow deep fried batter none of the tender pillows of ricotta gnocchi im used to with this dish it was also over salted and just incredibly greasythis coming from someone who loves salty french fries or onion rings i couldnt finish them the portion was also ridiculously small i know gnocchi is always a smaller portion but these were mini gnocchi and only came as 810 pearl sized balls of grease and i was really jealous of my non vegetarian dining partners who had plates of fresh pasta but again i couldnt finish them anyway i was really looking forward to the third course risotto funghi with 4 kinds of mushrooms because i love mushrooms and was really hungry and already disappointed in the meal unfortunately it was the worst course of the night for me it tasted like campbells mushroom soup that someone had added extra salt too there were clumps of the rice stuck together the different mushrooms which i picked out all tasted exactly the same with the same texture as theyd been overcooked in this mess there was one whole clove of garlic but the garlic flavours hadnt penetrated the rest of the dish it was seriously awful and my whole table agreed it was inedible i was really jealous of the sides everyone elses meals came with like wilted greens they said theirs was okay but the steaks they request medium rare were unevenly cooked and medium well done that medium rare there were some generous slices of parmesan on top of the risotto though and that was the highlight of my meal it isnt like me to not be able to eat my food ive been to many amazing italian restaurants in toronto italy and other countries i also eat at malls and cafeterias and 711 this food wouldnt have been good even if i were drunk and i did get drunk on all the wine since i was on an empty stomach as the food they served me was inedible everyone else enjoyed their food but were a little disappointed as nothing was outstanding or particularly good quality it seemed to be a case of them not caring about vegetarian food at all or maybe their chefs dont know how to work with flavours other than just using meat the over salting was really jarring i love salt but this was disgustingoverall it was one of the very worst meals i have ever been served and the price was outrageous for something id be angry and being served at a local pubalso im not sure how to change my profile but im no longer vegan heh,1.0

i have been seeing dr toni vaughn for acupuncture and margie for massage at the aim center for a few months now  all i can say is that this place rocks  the attention that you receive as a patient is second to none  dr toni is completely thorough and caring  when you see her she treats you like a friend makes you feel comfortable and really cares about your wellbeing  on my first visit we talked for 2 hours about my medical history and health goals  i have never had an experience like this with any other physician  margie is the best massage therapist that i have ever dealt with  she is also extremely caring hugs included  the work that she performs is amazing and she takes the time to show you activities to perform at home that will help with pain and stress in the body  chandra the office manager has an onyourside approach when it comes to dealing with insurance  she is completely competent in what she does and has such a friendly demeanor which is rare in a physicians office  before going to the aim center i didnt have much experience with naturopathic medicine and now i am hooked  i strongly recommend the aim center for those with an interest in naturopathic healing and total mind body and soul wellness  you will not be disappointed here,1.0

wow 65 to check the air in your rv tires  we took the rv in for a couple of repairs as we usually do here in vegas when we go through  this time we feel we were taken advantage of  it was 65 to tell us how to use the wiper switch correctly a 65 fee to fix the shade which was fair but the 65 to check air in 6 tires was over the top to stick it to a yearly returning customer  adios findlay there are other places here that would like our business  we got better odds at the gambling table,0.0
been here stayed here and eaten here before and loved it this last visit not so much went to the m life counter to try and redeem myvegas points early in the morning for breakfast upon arriving with our kids the wife went off to the side just barely visible to me and not close to any of the machines since there was no lines i was immediately told any myvegas rewards are not usable during christmas since it was blacked out i was disappointed but i get that  what i dont get is the person on the floor and immediately told my wife and kids to leave since they are underage sure i get that minors should not be allowed on the floor and its not legal but since i barely paused for a second to ask the hostess and was rudely told by the gentleman to leave before i can barely finish hearing my vouchers were not validthat was totally uncalled for sometimes its not what you say its how you say itand this time it couldve been told and handled differently  it didnt sit well with me and i didnt get a chance to voice my concern so let me tell my fellow yelpers to please consider twice before coming here if you want to be taken care of  there are plenty of better options,0.0

i found lovetts when i was looking for a collision repair shop close to home my insurance company sent me a list of preferred shops and they all had less than stellar reviews seeing the wonderful feedback on line about lovetts i decided to give them a shop from my 1st phone call they were a pleasure to deal with they answered any and all questions contacted my insurance company when the initial estimate did not fully cover the damages arranged for additional inspection  handled the financials directly with my insurance they called to keep me updated when my car needed additional days in the shop they even fully explained to me how hertz works to pick updrop off rentals at their shop when my car was ready they informed me that my battery had died while in the shop they jump started it every day to move it when they worked on it i wasnt surprised as it had never been replaced in the 5 years i owned the car  id seen some telltale signs that it might be failing they very kindly offered to get the battery  install it by the time i came to get my car that afternoon saying that they didnt want me to drive down the road only to have it die they even provided me with the invoice showing what they paid and giving me proof of purchase for warranty replacement if needed ill just say that sourcing my particular battery was quite the chore but they came through and installed it when i got there one of their wonderful guys had my trunk popped open and was putting a covering back on the inside he noticed that my license plate light was out so he took it uppon himself to pop a new one in so awesome my car was washed  sparkly clean the repair work was stellar i really felt taken care of  like they cared about doing great job i will absolutely use them again  would send any of my friends and family to them thanks lovetts,1.0
thanks yet again to the yelp app for finding my lunch  i typed in soul food and this place appeared  it had half a dozen glowing reviews so we decided to give it a shot  very glad we did  angie is very friendly i stopped by before we ate and got a to go menu  she advised me to call and order what we wanted as the food is cooked to order and it is not quick  this is totally fine with me i find that generally the quicker stuff is the less real it is  and usually the better it tastes when it takes some time to cookthere are some mainstays on the menu fried or smothered chicken for example and there are daily specials  we ate at angies on a thursday when meatloaf is the special  so my wife had meatloaf  this is a traditional meatloaf tomato sauce onions veggies  very moist went well with the mashed potatoes and brown gravy  we also tried mac n cheese fried corn and okra  of these the okra was my least favorite but i still really liked it  the fried corn has bacon and veggies in it it was a style we hadnt tried before  both of us liked it  id like to try to replicate this dish at home  the mac n cheese as expected was fantastic  classic soul food mac not based on a roux  very cheesy  i had the fried chicken  i was glad i called ahead because this dish can take 2530 minutes  again i dont mind since its fresh but i highly recommend you call first  this is a large serving of chicken 4 pieces with 2 very large drumsticks  both meals at 999 for the entre 2 sides and cornbread  very reasonable considering the flavor and quality of what you get  the fried chicken was seasoned very well  i find that a lot of places are too focused on the skin which is certainly important and leave out proper seasoning  not angie  the skin was crispy adhered to the chicken and was flavorful  thats the fried chicken trifectathe employees were very friendly  the place is small and sparsely decorated but we felt very comfortable  this is some serious soul food highly recommended,1.0
5 stars for the food 0 for the service literally the best mongolian beef ive ever had however it was also literally the worst service ive ever had i will never eat inside the restaurant again the waitress actually sighed out loud when i asked for some hot mustard never checked back after that and dropped off my bill before i even started my main dish i watched her pick up a check from another table before they left and she asked why no tip they pointed to the cash on the table and then picked  it up and walked out i was blown away by how much this person hated her job not once did she smile or make me feel like a guest instead i felt as though i had been trespassing  first time i ever stiffed a waitress,0.0

brokers are supposed to work for the paying customer not screw them over called this company when i was told they had great customer service and they really help the customers out i called to set up business coverage with them said i was new to az and opened a retail location and i need to get all the coverage needed to get my store covered they had no problems taking my money but when it came time to file a claim due to a break in they said the only covered they gave me was the bare bones liability covereage when comparing prices informed them what was needed and there prices they were comparing with was a full coverage deal liability theft damage and all with inventory all the ovner can say is that you didnt read the policy before i signed iti informed him that when i discuss a policy with a broker and he is matching other policys with same terms and we agree apon issues that what i thought i was signing not some bait and switchover priced brokers and they didnt give a rats ass and i have mutiple policys with this company will be cancelling all policys in the morning and calling my attorney for bad faith,0.0

this place is amazing d first of all my bf and i dont typically like hainan chicken usually has this weird taste that i cant explain but know that i dont like but felt the urge to order it because of all the great reviews and they were right the chicken was soo tender and juicy and went super well with that spicy house sauce we were actually really excited to order the fried chicken baos basically the main reason we came here and boyyyyyyy am i glad we did we really wanted to come back for another order of those baos but we had such little time the chef seemed super nice as he came out a few times to greet his regulars and we were only there for an hour or less sooo hes a pretty popular guy id sayrules order first then sit or wait to be seated it is a small mompop restaurant so be patient for their awesome foood we waited only a few minutes but found it surprising to be full at 230pm  definitely try the hainin chicken and those fried chicken baos  my onyl regret is not trying the fried chicken entree ,1.0

i passed this place at least 50 times walking along fremont street to the el cortez over the past several years finally decided to pay a visit while staying at the el cortez across the street once inside i was immediately struck by the size of the place its at least five times larger than i imagined from passing by outside before this it always seemed like the guests were crammed into the front part of the shop surrounded by glass on two sides of the building whenever i walked by and peered at the coffeeslurpers i felt like i was passing an aquarium and should drop some food insidebut my impressions after visiting are completely different this is a place i cant compare to any other if i had to attempt to describe it im just going to date myself okay so here goes its kind of like record  tape traders meets starbucks meets local art gallerysee half of you probably dont even know what record  tape traders is but this is good it means youve got your youth please use it responsiblythe beat is more than just a great place to grab coffee its a world unto itself sure theres all kinds of excellent coffee and food but theres also an art gallery with some truly stunning pieces of work theres a very large upstairs too so dont forget that if you decide to venture into the art realms adding to the vibe here there are some cool classics being piped through the speakers and vinyl albums right there in the shop remember thosestaff is very upbeat friendly and professional one even told me i smelled good right after i placed my order did i probably my secret mk high intensity cologne and yes i have a mary kay rep but hey what a compliment to go with your coffee this is a place where laptops and tablets abound deals are done tony hsieh of zappos grabs his morning fix and introductions are made several times in one morning i only know this because i grabbed a seat at a table fired up my laptop and blended in with the morning crowdand what an eclectic crowd it is all kinds hang out here the wellheeled the working class like me and some who had clearly just stolen their ipads from someone a tourist no doubt but at least they have good taste in coffee shopswhile not exactly off the beaten path the beat coffeehouse is less touristy than say the starbucks or seattles bests youll find on the strip or under the fremont canopy its more of a locals joint and a very fun place to grab your morning jolt or even just to visit just one more fixture that makes downtown worth whatever it takes to get you there,1.0
the absolute worse customer service ive ever seen i tried to bring a bus group to the casino but after leaving over 16 messages with 8 different people i received not one return call i even contacted the acting general manager who of course i didnt answer the phone either and had his assistant to call me back only to tell me they would not be able to work with us i wonder how an organization like this stay in business well my group of 60 or more people visit arizona every year and we have no plans on visiting the casino ever again im sure the area is full of businesses and merchants who would love to have our business i would give this business a below zero rating if possible,0.0
do not take your car to this nightmare shop i would give them zero stars if i could  after the transmission died on my car local tow truck driver recommended this shop  being new to the area i said sure take it there  big mistakei paid close to 4000 for a used transmission with allegedly 40k miles on it  i asked owner for paperwork showing where he got the transmission so that i could verify that it indeed only had that many miles  owner refused to provide that  but that wasnt the worst of it  it took them four weeks to fix the car i tried my best to be patient with them but every time i called it was some new story as to why they still werent done when their various stories started contradicting themselves i called the owner out on it  he then started yelling at me for accusing him and his lead technician of lying  but wait it gets worse  after finally getting my car back the new transmission failed within two weeks i was stranded on the side of the highway about 130 miles from home i called the shop to ask what i should do and they said go ahead and get it towed to the shop and well take a look as it turns out they said that there was a leak in some gasket and the transmission fluid was low so the transmission was burning up  wonderful  my theory is that they forgot to refill the fluid reservoir when they put it in regardless it was their fault  i asked the owner if he would help me with the 450 tow truck bill and he refused despite the fact that it was his shops incompetence that caused it and despite the fact that he had offered me a 12000 mile warranty  so make that 4450 for a used transmission of dubious origins and approximately five weeks total without a car  mistake learned  my only solace is that maybe this review will help someone else avoid the misery this shop brought into my life,0.0

we have always loved the tuck shop  the ambiance the food the service  recently i made a same day reservation for five and much to my dismay they were unable to accommodate me for the times i needed  my error  they could serve us an hour later  it was a mid week reservation who knew they were having a few larger parties  i begged but no way could they give me the times i wanted  so after a lot of back and forth they said it would be ok to come in and sit in their living room have drinks and starters  we did that and it was such a pleasant evening as we awaited our table  as it turned out the large party was delayed and they seated us earlier than we expected   we ordered our food were served timely and had a lovely evening   the food was delicious   the wine was wonderfulas always  thank you to the tuck shop for graciously accommodating us  best food owners and staff  you are the best  always gracious,1.0

let me start out by saying i still have not eaten here the pictures however are making me rethink my stance  a couple years ago i was so excited to go to this restaurant and even got something in the mail with pictures that i brought along with me  it clearly stated the hours breakfast was served and as far as the ad was concerned we were on time  however when we sat down and i tried to order the picture i was told they dont prepare eggs that way past a certain time of day  that i could receive eggs prepared the way they said or not at all  due to my prior excitement over the picture and as a customer being told there were eggs in the kitchen but they would not use them the way they advertised i was very deflated  it ruined my appetite we stood up without ordering or eating and have never been back since  i am glad to see so many positive reviews hopefully i will move past my grudge soon and finally try the food that aesthetically appealed to me before,0.0

i was a customer for years the manager was always accomodating i can respect the patience it must take to deal with a daily influx of customers and rarely criticize any worker  today i drove over to print a few things and mail out a gift i was terrified to see a man out front with two of the most terrifying dogs ive ever seenunleashed one looked like it had a limp but was still intimidating i returned to my car to wait for him to leave the area when it appeared he walked into postnet but i wondered if maybe he and the dogs had gone next door   not wanting to sit in my car all day i called a girl answered i asked if there were dogs in the store she said yea so i responded  is that allowed in a  nasty tone she told me hes allowed to have his dogs in the store and hung up   i wish the owner should reconsider allowing animals into such a place especially the ones i saw its a lawsuit waiting to happen mainly though it was the rudeness i encountered with all of the nice  people whod appreciate a job why hire such a person who is nasty to the customers naturally i dont want to return who would pay money to be mistreated or heaven forbid mauled,0.0

if i could give this a no star i would first off the dishes were such small portions second the dishes had maybe a couple of pieces of meat in it so when you order a bunch of food youll probably get a single portion of meat in it and last the service was just beyond rude the waitress wasnt helpful in the food selection and she didnt even bother asking us if we needed the bill she came by to ask if we were done and then walked away took us about ten minutes to get her attention so we can pay and leave theres so many other places to go to for thai food so dont even bother with this one this isnt my first time here when i went couple of years ago it was such a great place but now quality of food and service has definitely gone down,0.0
i dont know why i keep giving this place a chance  they are nice but they do not care about the work they do  the men do not know what they are doing  they try to finish quickly so they are constantly hurting you they paint over your cuticles so feel behind lifting and catching on everything  very cheap so i guess you get what you pay for,0.0

i dont even write yelp reviews but im making an exception because chris owner of town barber is that rare dude who is loyal to his customers and i dont know where else to put this storyive been getting my fades done by chris since he was an apprentice barber at crows nest charging only 15 a cut probably since 2010 i used to get my hair cut once a week cause i like to stay looking fresh so chris has cut my hair literally hundreds of times every haircut has been exacting and perfect he genuinely takes the time to ensure its so ill think im done and be trying to get up and hell be touching up this side and that part grabbing his clippers to fix some tiny imperfection no one else would ever have noticed the guy genuinely cares about his craft and it shows in his workmore importantly than that hes a stand up humble guy after ending his apprenticeship at crows nest and moving to a full barber charging full barber prices he kept me at the original price for years after he refused to change the price i paid and even when i offered he wouldnt accept more money a lot of business owners are customer service friendly like on the surface but chris actually backs it up he understands just naturally as a facet of his personality that long term customer relationships are more valuable than an extra 10 in his pocket today which is a rare traitin 2012 i left toronto and moved to california then moved back two years later i went to crows nest and found out chris wasnt working there anymore and had opened up his own spot so i went over there for a cut during my first cut i mentioned how i was looking for work chris referred me to a friend of his who was hiring and gave me his email i emailed him we met up and ive been working for his company for the past 7 months so chris helped me get a jobthen as if that wasnt enough when i told him i got the job he told me i couldnt pay for my haircuts anymore because i was working for his friends company i dont even know if i should publicize this cause yall will go in expecting to leave with jobs and free haircuts ive referred everyone i know there my nephew and brother in law now get their hair cut by chris too and thats a strong endorsement because my sister is serious about her sons haircutsso if youre not getting your haircut at town barber you should be,0.0

yum that really sums it up we went here last night after having received a gift certificate for a wedding gift we were so impressed with the food and my husband actually uttered the words i dont want this to end we started with sangria and fondue which were both fantastic my entree was the smart chicken and hubs had the pork tenderloin both  were unbelievably good and our server was wonderful its rare to have all the components of a nice meal come together so perfectly and this is definitely worth the money,1.0
so glad i dropped in here maggie is the best sweet strong and attentive shes like a bloodhound when it comes to finding all my knots i love strong pressure and she never skimps on that  facility is clean with semiprivate sections relaxing instrumental music sometimes youll hear a bit of noise from the restaurant next door or the snores of a client whos fallen asleep during their massage it never bothers me but bring foam earplugs if youre the sensitive type  you get massaged with your clothes that you wear in so wear a tank top and shorts or something similar,1.0
call it crappy taco that pretty much sums up the experience you are going to get unlike others i actually thought the tacos were pretty good but on this busy sunday everything else was unpleasant other than the view there is absolutely no reason to visit this place unless you have a fetish for outdoor jenga and lousy service and you can find views just as good as this in cleveland where your experience will actually be pleasurablethis was our second time visiting here and both times were unpleasant on this visit1 the outdoor hostess greeted us with contempt she may as well have said oh you when she took our name a smile and a hello seemed a foreign concept to her2 since there was a wait we sat at the bar we may as well have been ghosts the bartender looked past us three times while he waited on other patrons who it seemed were his old pals from high school finally another bartender came and helped good right wrong3  i got the house margarita and i think it may have been the only time in my life that i sent a drink back it was like drinking salted lime water i had both my wife and friend taste it to make sure i wasnt crazy but they concurred it was nothing short of awful 4  our server was kind but she seemed to really be struggling i am not sure if this was her fault or the inept and unfriendly bar but it took us over 20 minutes to get our drinks in fact our appetizers came out before our drinks and when the apps did arrive we were missing our guacamole in fact our main entrees arrived before our guacamolewhich arrived before we had more chips with which to eat them and so onnothing is all bad the tacos were actually pretty tasty paying our bill was quick but i found the whole experience condescending what i mean by that is that coastal taco seems to exist on the premise that because of their prime riverfront location the employees dont have to do anything other than show up and act surly as if we should be thrilled that we graced them with our presence no that is not the way it is supposed to workgiven the embarrassment of riches when it comes to clevelands dining scene we deserve and should expect better,0.0

i have a 2003 mustang gt with some issues but none that were a show stopper until yesterday 0the diagnostics were kinda pricy but the cost is applied towards your repair if you decide to go forward with any repairsi dropped off my vehicle late friday about 430 and was promised a visual inspection and call back if diagnostics were needed that did not happen which concerned me when i came in saturday morning my car was in the bay being looked at i had only signed and authorized for a visual inspection but they had done some electrical diagnostics which i dont think they would have charged me for i dont know everything about car repair but i can tell most of the time if i am being bsed they recommended about four repairs to fix one problemone repair they recommended i know was needed but i feel werent necessary in other words i have been driving with this condition for some time three years and was told by another shop that the repair could be put off for a while but the condition should be repaired soon that was just two months ago dont get me wrong it is not like meineke was doing wrong or even acting in bad faith it was one shops opinion versus anothers along with my my previous research into the issue that made me feel that the one repair could be put off for a while   its hard to believe that the issue had contributed to my cars driveability  but i needed to get it done sooner or later so i opted to get it done that day because the cost was very fair and reasonable and i believed the shop was acting in good faiththey did recommend a spark plug change as that could have contributed to my issue but if they had actually checked the plugs they would have seen that they were fine and recently changedi just got the car back and did not check the invoice yet but i will update this review in a few weeks and give more feed back as the cars obd calibrates1116 updateno problems with the repair and satisfied with the service i have not had any more issues with my car so i have not been back which is very goodi would recommend this place to a friend for sure,0.0

i usually love this place but tonight the service was absolutely horrible first off they were out of kalbi and spam musubi the excuse from hostess was it was a busy night thats seriously not an excuse you should say to a paying customer then it took forever to get my food over 40min and 3 other parties received food before me i ordered two meat plate of katsu and beef and then a plate of shrimp and thats it one other dad and dtr left so upset because it took so long for their food to be served i asked how much longer for my food the first time and she asked whatd your order again so i told her no update i asked 10 min later and she said whatd you order again seriously i repeated my order and she said oh here it is it just came out it was my katsu and beef and she said thats it i said no im still waiting for my shrimp the cooks in back looked like they had no idea about it and told me they were just waiting for my katsu to be done i showed them the plate like its right here  suddenly they had a plate of shrimp there for who knows how long sitting there and said oh are you table 6 like yes i am actually what the hell is happening there no idea what theyre doing or how to respond to customersonly pro is that the food is still good too bad they dont even have it in stock just checked and my order is wrong  its chicken teriyaki instead of beef and they gave me salad instead of macaroni salad awesome,0.0

im surprised by some of the bad reviews on here as ive only had only good experiences at essence the service has always been friendly and efficient and everything ive tried has been delicious they have daily specials which i usually order that have always turned out to be a good choice the portions are generous for the price and they use high quality ingredients at an average price of 10 for lunch i think this is a great value compared to a lot of other restaurants in the neighborhood after dining here several times i finally decided to try a mini caramel macaron they forgot to bring it out with my meal so to make up for it they brought me an extra vanilla one complimentary totally unnecessary but a very nice gesture  the macarons were as good as the ones ive had in paris i highly recommend the caramel one so rich and amazing i cant wait to try more,1.0
this is the type of spin class that makes you work makes you sweat but youre having a great time dancing on a bike so you dont even really realize the time is flying by  the studio has about 24 bikes and the class sizes vary  i tend to go in the same time slot and some days the classes are close to full other days there may only be a handful of us  there are also a great variety of instructors  some that prefer the faster pace of a class and others that like to focus on strength building i like these  they also have shoes available to rent new not like old bowling shoes for 3 per classrachel the owner is very friendly and accommodating  you can really tell that she has a passion for fitness and cares for her customersif i had anything negative to say about this place is that there arent a lot of options for class times  but im hoping that as this place becomes more established theyve only been open about six months that they will be able to offer a broader variety of class times,1.0

if emma is still a manager here dont expect to be helped much i had bought shoes as a christmas gift and they were too narrow for my boyfriend to fit in them so i brought them back hoping he could have them exchanged for another shoe he liked well it turns out size 10 is very popular and there was no shoe he wanted available in his size in store or online hes not extremely picky either so he asked for about 6 different shoes and no luck we couldnt even get them from other stores so we asked emma if we could just get store credit to spend it later when we find something else we like and she said no we were 10 days past the returnexchange policy and apparently we were lucky she even considered letting us exchange them in the first place i let her know that we would literally be throwing our money away if we exchanged the shoes for a pair he didnt even want and she said shes sorry but we need to think of this from the companys point of view we cant just let anyone come in 4 months later off the street to return shoes because we dont know what happened to them i was like wait what first of all were not from the street were customers who have a legit receipt and the company doesnt have any shoes he wants in his size the shoes im returning are white all around so you can see theyre in perfect condition she kept repeating the same thing and i was so fed up i called the corporate office they apologized for her because obviously policies are just guidelines and even though she had the power to give us store credit she didnt and thus will require more training on what the company actually requires of her were so done with this store we went to the foot locker at az mills and told them what happened and the manager there gave us store credit and said this isnt the first time its happened emma has pissed off a lot of people so i hope she gets it together and learns how to appreciate moneyspending customers,0.0

i really liked it  great new sub joint right in the point parkart institute zone  for me perfect place to grab a bite before an evening classprices are really cheap  if you go at lunchtime you can get a combo with a freshman sub side chips macaroni salad or pickle spears and a soda for 550 omg thats super cheap to me  and the freshman is really quite large and stuffed with meat  i dont think i could have eaten any larger of a sizei tried the steak and cheese no cheese no onions  the onions are raw not cooked so no thank you to them  the sub was great  hot fresh tasty  and that was just the guy behind the counter rim shot no seriously it was very good and just what i was in the mood for  of course if i had been normal and gotten the cheese it would have been even better and stayed together  but i dont like cheese all the time and it dont like me lactose intolerantthe macaroni salad did waylay me with an unexpected bite of fresh raw onion  bleh  almost ruined my taste buds for my sub  personally i would steer clear of it in the future even though it was very fresh and otherwise tastyother than that great cheap meal on a cold night  the dining room is pleasant and a lot more clean and comfortable than a lot of sub joints i have seen aroundlooking forward to trying the egg salad which is made daily  hopefully without onions,1.0

read this before you gohint 1this is meant to be a familystyle restaurant meaning that you get little plates and everyone takes some of each entree on their little platehint 2 this is a korean restaurant meaning the food is korean spicy if you dont like spicy do not get the tteokkboki or the spicy chicken if things are really spicy for you you can cool off your mouth with rice pickled radish or iced teahint 3 if you get the bibimbap please mix it all together and add gochujang sauce to your desired spicy level you can always add more sauce on your own platewe had a great experience  we were seated quickly we got our food fairly quickly everything was hot temp wise and our drinks were refilled before we asked we did go after 3 on a sunday though and the food the food was so good the only downside was that the food did not come out all at once but if you share it family style you just start with what comes out firsti wish bonchon luck because we would like to be regulars,1.0

in a city that has an abundance of mexican restaurants this is one of the gems that i have discovered  mexican is one of my favorite types of food so to continue to frequent one place really says something  the menu is typical of a taco shop with tacos burritos quesadillas nachos fries and others  i especially enjoy the torta  they have a great selection of meats for any of their menu items  everything is made to order so during a busy time it can be a bit slow but it is well worth the wait,1.0

i love your helping hands i enjoyed their services so much i wrote an article about them and put them on my website as a top pick of las vegas here it is belowthis is our top pick for house cleaning services in las vegas they are thorough dependable and have successfully served the las vegas valley since 1991 even more they use only safe and green productsive lived here two years and tried six different businesses ive also heard plenty of horror stories from longtime residents dont be fooled by dirt cheap cleaning services you get what you pay for some places rush over things some places break things some places take things some use strongsmelling toxic chemicals that leave your place smelling like a grim hospital ward other places go through employees like air traffic controllers  once i was informed by a cleaning office that two experienced women would be arriving at 2pm sharp at 225pm two guys approximately 18 and 19 roll up in a raggedy gangster car with no hubcaps and cracked rear window they walk in pants pulled down showing their boxers carrying a cheap old vacuum with dangling cord i say sorry guys not happeningthen one day i notice a shiny practical white hatchback parked across the street loaded with a variety of cleaning supplies the car windows display a house cleaning advertisementlogo soon three industriouslooking women come bustling out my neighbors apartment door carrying vacuums and mops i ask them for a flyer which they hand me with a smilenext week they clean my 2 bedroom apartment before they arrive cindy a coowner and manager gives me a courteousy call to check in the threewomen crew does an amazing job everything is swept cleaned scrubbed scoured washed emptied dusted polished picked up put away folded and now shiny and get this  it smells fine too light and clear no crazy chemicals they use only safe and green products a few minutes after the girls leave cindy calls again making sure all went welli was so impressed i used them again they did another stellar jobso i decided las vegas top picks should have a top pick for housecleaning too i asked to meet the owners cindy and bobby one spring afternoon i visited their office we sipped peppermint tea and talked house cleaningthey told me some funny stories of celebrity clients one individual had a large cougar in his garage which often sat atop a 100k luxury car scratching the bejesus out of it since theyve been in business for nearly 22 years they have many such stories such a length of time also exemplifies their success and trustworthiness bobby the owner takes pride in her work and good care of her girls their website which i hope you visit further demonstrates this it is comprehensive professional personal and with a big clean heart they work hard to tailor their cleaning to your precise specifications in my experience businesses that truly care about what they do provide the best servicealso awesome was their giant city map pinned to an office wall was i in a secret cia hub scouting the streets of las vegas or perhaps they just have tons of customers and know this town like the back of their helping handsthey even have a mascot  a cute friendly little dog named bella  i believe its important to find skilled trustworthy businesses whenever spending money doubly important when they come into your home on an ongoing basis for house cleaning your helping hands is top in this townhttplasvegastoppickscomyourhelpinghandshousecleaning,1.0

i have been taking been taking all 3 of our pups to scottsdale vet clinic for over 5 years our primary veterinarian is dr lockhart he is kind and very good with our dogs i trust him 100 with his advice and choices to help benefit the health and wellbeing of our dogs since we absolutely love our vet clinic we also chose to use their grooming services for our dogs i highly recommend chris for grooming services she is great with handling our dogs even great with our stubborn snotty chihuahua who absolutely loves chris chris even gives her beautifully painted nails we have never had a bad experience with her and our dogs i always recommend her to people when they are seeking out a groomer the only negative i can say about the place is the front desk doesnt always have the best customer service if it wasnt for the amazing vet techs drs and grooming i would probably walk out with a less than amazing experience with the way the front desk handles situations their communication is subpar considering the rest of the clinic is amazing,1.0

a las vegas favorite for myself and coworkers  at least one visit to this place is in order every time we are staying in or passing through vegas  if you are looking for fresh food that has an unexpected twist on two great food styles then look no further  meals are made to order and if you are not absolutely starving you should stick with the half orders  i think i have had just about everything off the menu now and i havent been disappointed  great value for fresh prepared food and the flavors are on point  as long as they are around ill always be back,1.0

disappointed i was referred to this property by a resident so i was really looking forward to seeing the moldes for rent  however can we say major disappointment with the employee working jennifer was her name  she has absolutely no customer service skills at all she was assisting a couple at the time i walked in so i sat down and waited when she finally decided to greet me she was very rude  she asked me well i should say barked at me as to what i needed i advised i was interested in a two bedroom model she then said to me it was going to be a 15 to 20 minute wait now this was said with a major attitude i said that was fine i didnt mind waiting she then barked again and said  are  you sure  i mean its a wait and i am the only employee here  they left me all alone here this was so unprofessional and rude  at this point i lost all interest and left its very sad that this employee jennifer is a reflection on the company and other staff members the resident that referred me has always had great and pleasant experience with the staff and loves residing at this property  i will go back but i certainly will not have jennifer helping nor do i think she belongs in this type of profession,0.0

the only reason i am giving this location a single star is because of a decision  made at corporate so i was told so i guess this rating goes out to all their locationsi went in for a pumpkin donut why because its not even two weeks until thanksgiving and who doesnt want a couple pumpkin flavored donuts this time of year corporate dunkin dounts thats who or at least thats what i was told was told id have to go somewhere else to get pumpkin flavored donuts not in that many words but what they told me was that corporate allowed them to purchase just so many of them until they were not available any more for the yearif this is true  and if its not someone still screwed up to not have pumpkin flavored donuts this time of year then i think its a bone headed decision i mean talk about being out of touch with your customers talk about turning away business and sending your custom base to another donut store talk about plain stupidity i mean what time of the year do you have a craving for pumpkin flavored donuts than now around thanksgiving america runs on dunkin well dunkin you sent this america running towards the competition,0.0
my husband and i have been eating at los olivos for the last 15 years  this restaurant is authentic mexican cuisine  the place is run by family  sometimes you do have to wait awhile for the food  the wait staff is usually pretty good  the food is always fresh and served hot  today i ordered the chimichanga plate  the shredded beef is always delicious  there homemade salsa is so delicious  im not sure exactly what restaurant a previous reviewer ate at stating they ate garbage  maybe they were at taco bell  you wont be disappointed with los olivios but be patient  authentic food thats fresh takes time so enjoy visiting with friends and family while you wait,1.0

my first impression of the house brasserie was a disappointment my boyfriend had made reservations several weeks in advance as a surprise valentines day gift to me the reservations were confirmed  for 845 via opentable then a voicemail was received confirming the same time but we would need to be out of the restaurant by 1030 as the table was needed for another reservation at 550 a text was received confirming 545 reservation time my boyfriend called the restaurant ask about the mixup only to be told in a condescending voice that they would try to accommodate the 845 time slot my upset boyfriend was left with the impression that the restaurant was trying to coerce him into canceling his reservation so someone else could take our place instead this is just poor form for a restaurant that is supposed to be such a fabulous place,0.0
every time anyone asks about sushi or wants to know where to get good sushi i always refer them to sushimon now dont get me wrong this place is not perfect however having tried more than a few spots in town and seen the many gimmicks put up by other places sushimon remains my favorite sushi spot all the negatives that people mention about this place are technically  true this place is not close to the strip the wait time can be longsometimes topping out at 1 hour  the restaurant is smallishhowever if youre visiting vegas and really want good sushi is it  that horrible to drive an extra 10 minutes to not have to deal with casino parking not have to walk a mile and a half to get to the place and not deal with the absurd prices you often find at restaurants on the stripive often found that any restaurant be it big or small that can produce a full house and wait is doing something rightsushimon doesnt offer you fine dining service its not going to blow you away with its superior servicei dont know about you guys but i really dont think that mattersif youre getting ayce sushi you already have an idea of what kind of sushi you want and what your preference isall the servers ive seen at sushimon are good at getting the food out and keeping the drinks fullyou could go to some dirty place in the middle of a bad neighborhood and get sushi for 45 cheaper surebut sushimon offers almost their entire menu on their ayce and allyoucaneat dessert as well i know a lot of places mark off menu items and only offer you one dessertthings i love from sushimonnigiri hamachi yellowtail salmon super white tuna unagiother offerings hamachi collarmost places dont offer this and they sometimes run out but if they have order it salmon collarall the rollsand 12 rolls for almost all of them if you want to try the roll without getting too full again something most places dont offerunisea urchin one per personama ebisweet shrimp also one per persondessertaycemochi ice cream strawberryvanillagreen tea red bean and lychee ice cream tempura ice creamsure you could in theory find a cheaper place than this in a more glamorous location but if im gonna shell out 20 for a meal i dont mind paying a little bit more knowing that my meal is going to be good sushimon offers you a large menu to choose from speedy service and most importantly consistency ive been here at least a dozen times and havent once had a bad experience in case anyone is wondering they dont do call ahead seating so you have to arrive in person to get your party on the list,0.0

i went here once and was not at all pleased the service was slow my order got messed up and the waitress was more concerned with gossiping with other staff members than taking our drink order the burgers were dry and were not cooked to the temperature we ordered it also took forever for the waitress to bring us back our change after we paid i actually had to ask her to bring us our change and she had the nerve to say that she didnt think we needed any im sorry but i gave her a 100 bill and the total bill was 47 that really shocked me,0.0

found this place after shopping at walmart decided to go in for a quick lunch with my daughter and surprisingly it was packed the young hostess was very nice and informed us it was going to be about 20 minutes or less to get seated the wait ended up being 10 minutes when i sat down i was greeted immediately by the server who happened to be the hostess as well talk about multitasking anyways ordered drinks and placed my order after she came back with our drinks i ordered the black garlic ramen for me and for my daughter the chicken karaage food came out quick the black garlic ramen was amazing the garlic chips and garlic oil they put in really gives it that awesome kick ass flavor my daughter also enjoyed her chicken karaage the karaage was perfect for her a bit on the small size but for a kid it was perfect not only was the food great and met me and my daughters expectations service was also great kudos to the girl that was hosting serving and bussing she was kicking ass i will definitely be back to try the rest of their ramen,1.0

i absolutely love coco donuts they are always fresh and dont leave that weird oil after taste like some donut places do  they dont have any of those fancy cereal covered donuts the donuts here  arent covered in peeps for easter nor do they have an extra pound of candy on them as decor  they are just donuts good old fashion donuts  donuts like the way they were meant to be  the store front is small and there is not much room to eat there its definitely more of a pick up and take home to enjoy kind of place the customer service is average not great but not bad ive come so many different times and days and ive never once had any issues like some other people have maybe they just didnt like the attitude of certain customers and they are selective to who the sell to who knows but the average customer service is easier to deal with than average tasting donuts from other places this place will continue to be my go to,1.0

summerlicious diners bewarei went with a rather large group of people here for lunch to try their summerlicious menu we were very excited to go because their menu looked simple but good we walked in and immediately loved the decor and the vibe of the place we were eventually given water and placed our drink orders most people at our table had the calamari as an appetizer and i have to admit it was pretty good another one of my friends had the salad which she said was yummy and the presentation of it was lovely the only iffy thing that happened during this course was that someone requested some lemon to use with their calamari and the waitress brought it to her in a dirty glass the main course was where everything started to really go downhill part 1 the burgerthe majority of us ordered the burger one person specifically asked if the burger came with any type of sauce on it and he was told by the waiter that no it didnt so he continued to order his burger with just cheese lettuce and tomato on it when he finally got his burger it had everything on it including some type of mayonnaisesauce he then asked our waiter to switch it as he was told that the burger was not supposed to come with sauce the waiter took it back and then brought back another with pickles and onions on it no cheese and no sauce we asked the waiter to take it back again as the only thing that he wanted was a burger with lettuce cheese and tomatoes the burger came back again but this time we noticed that even though there was no sauce on the bun the kitchen had replaced one of the old burger patties with sauce and stuck it on the burger confused yet we called for the manager at this point and explained what happened and after 4 tries the kitchen or our waiter got it right ive never seen anyone have to work so hard for a simple burgerpart 2 the salmon another person in our group ordered the salmon it was raw we also had to call the manager for this one and she was given another well donedessert was interesting people said that the tiramisu was actually good id believe it it looked good half of us ordered the very questionable creme brulee i say questionable only because it was a very very cold custard with what looked like an attempt to fire the top but then fell flat because after they fired the top they put it back in the fridge so it in essence became custard with a soggy really sweet top it wasnt horrible but it certainly wasnt creme bruleeafter all that youd think that the restaurant would have at least comped the cheque for the guy who had to try 4 times to get a very simple burger and comp the girl whos salmon was raw but no that was a fight as well in the end one of them paid their bill and the other fought a long and hard battle and finally got his meal comped what started out as a great place turned out horrible i definitely dont recommend eating there,0.0
i love this place  dangelos is one of my favorite italian restaurants in the area  the atmosphere is quiet and good for a date or a nice dinner with family  the salads are awesome dont mind the other reviewers  my only let down on my last visit was that they dont carry gnocchi as a regular menu item anymore  i used to get that with the breaded chicken strips on top  it was fantastic  i highly recommend dangelos,1.0

my favorite things about vdara in no particular orderconvenience you dont have to walk a mile through a crowded casino to the guest elevators because there is no casino easy short walk to the elevators and in your room you go lifesaver if youre a girl in heels and think you might never feel your toes ever again at the end of a long night kitchenette a microwave sure the fridge is tiny and barely cools a drink let alone keep your food at a safe temperature but its something when you have leftovers its great to come back in the early morning of partying and just pop it in the microwave and be able to eat in 1 minute time theres a stove too you can request for cooking tools and platesbowlsetc room size and amenities this is for the regular room theres the kitchen area with dining table a living room with a pull out bedcouch a queen bed and a full bathroom with shower and bath large windows to enjoy the view two televisions plus everythings modern with the touch of vegas sexylocation to get to cosmopolitan from vdara you exit the hotel and turn left walk a few feet go down a flight of stairs then walk a few more feet and tada youre in front of the cosmo entrance okay i wish it was closer but its not far at all actually we tried to take a taxi from vdara to cosmo and they wouldnt let us thats how close it is aria is just next door too and theres a tram to bellagio rates just look it up rooms tend to be cheaper than all the other hotels on the strip seriously how why when vdara is so darn nicethats all i can think of for now i love vdara and would live here if i could they do have that option,1.0

last weekend i decided to go on a hunt to see if i could find a deal worthy of trading in my current car for a newer model i went to two dealerships because one i was familiar with and closer to my home and the other had the exact car i wanted i should have never made that second tripi already put car salesman at a lower bar than other people in my mind but this was a whole new level of low if you dont want to end your day wanting to staple things to peoples heads i would stay away from this dealershipi walked into the dealership knowing what i wanted i still wanted to browse first but i had researched this is also not my first car buying experience and not my first mazda i am well aware of the line oh yeah and im also a car fanatic i didnt mind being hunted down by a salesman right away because i had really already knew what i wanted it was coincidental that without saying what i wanted the first car he decided to show me was the one i had seen in their online inventory soon enough i was on a test drive great car as expected i asked some simple questions such as if i could have more details on the specifics of the particular perimeter alarm that was installed on that car to which the salesman did not have an answer makes me think it would have been fun to ask him what was under the hoodwe all know that what comes next is the fun part and by fun i mean extremely annoying process that takes 10 times longer than it should  the negotiating process the first part was estimating the trade in value of my car though he decided to wrap this up in the first round of pricing negotiations right off the bat i was undercut by a couple grand at least on my trade in not cool i told him that the trade in value wasnt acceptable and asked if i could find out the specific price plan i was eligible for to which i received a blank look i would expect a dealership employee to know the various standard pricing plans i also let him know i wanted to know what other offers were available after waiting awhile he came back with no change in the trade in but did give me the pricing plan i was eligible forsince it was still not where it needed to be i explained to him what i was looking for i told him my situation and that i did not need to buy a new car i told him that my car was perfectly fine and in amazing condition and that i wasnt desperate i let him know the price i had gotten down to at another dealership and where i ideally wanted to be i said i didnt want to play negotiation games and i wanted to know how close he could get methings quickly got out of line i was treated with great disrespect as i was given excuse after excuse and attack after attack at one point he recommended i lease and when i explained to him i did not want to lease i was given a rant of how i dont put enough miles on my car and its stupid for me to buy really okay im out then if that wasnt enough i was also attacked for asking what the lowest price was i was asked if i wanted the company to lose money all while he kept informing me that he gets paid on commission which goes by the number of cars he sells i guess maybe i looked like i didnt know how car dealerships worked and how the car buying process goes at one point he asked again where i wanted to be payment wise to which i told him he then put a range down on a scrap piece of paper with an x and a line below it and told me to sign when i said i wasnt comfortable signing a scrap piece of paper below a payment price range without any detail or further information he became very agitatedin the end i let him know that this wasnt going anywhere and that i didnt think the price was going to be where i needed it to be i told him that with the economy the way it is that i figured the price would be lower when i purchased my other car in a much better economy i was able to get a better deal i asked if i could have my pricing plan certificate back and was given a very sarcastic you can have whatever you wanti was so repulsed by the way i was treated i emailed customer service at the dealership and never received a response i cannot believe they would ignore a situation like this though with the only other review being a 1 i am not that surprised anymore slightly more detail is available on my blog but i didnt want to write a novel here unless it was wanted oops i guess i already did ,0.0
nate truly saved the dayi had grown up with dogs my whole life and had just gotten my first dog on my own and expected everything to run smoothly as it always did my husband and i moved into a new house and my dogs behavior began to change she became aggressive when we were outside together and even cornered me once i felt like i had no control and was extremely anxious when i was around her a feeling i never wanted to feel with my dog i immediately reached out to nate who spent a few hours with me over text talking through ways to handle the situation until we could meet up after our first session i couldnt believe how much better i felt around my dog we worked on simple day to day activities first like walking on a leash and not having my arm pulled out of it socket and how to answer the front door with and excited anxious dog we then moved on to the bad behaviors outside and ways to correct her my dog has truly done a 180 thanks to nate and has even been given compliments on how well behaved she is i would recommend nate to anyone especially if they are struggling with a dog as they are suppose to bring love and excitement into a home not fear and anxiety thanks nate for all you have done,0.0

we are a family who usually dont have good luck with hotels  we finally picked a good one i highly recommend this hotel it isnt located on the strip and it is clean  the room looks like a mini apartment it has a huge bathroom with a shower and a whirlpool tub it has a kitchen with a stove microwave full size refrigerator sink a lot of cabinets and counter  it has a living room separate from the bed room with a sofa that pulls out into a bed a desk fireplace balcony and a flat screen tv it even has a washer and dryer inside the bedroom was nice also the room has plenty of closet space this hotel is great for families it has valet parking only so bring plenty of tip money it has a restaurant and indoor pool great place,1.0
this was my first visit here and i was impressed it was a free smoothie night i was greeted cheerfully at the door by and enjoyed all the workers decked out in hawaiian leis they had the free drinks prepared and ready to hand out so there was no wait and my nutritional questions were answered with a smile i would definitely return for some of the yummy looking menu items,1.0
do not i repeat do not rent a car from this place if you are flying into toronto and expecting this car rental to be in the airport it is not if youre flying international you will have to take a shuttle to a different terminal and then call them to be picked up i was aware of the need to be picked up however i was not aware of needing to find the shuttle and take it to a different terminali was also not aware of the need to have proof of car insurance otherwise being forced to buy car insurance from them interestingly this policy only applied to me as i spoke to other unhappy renters they were not being forced into purchasing insurance they were however being charged for preexisting scratches on the car and had to go through an ordeal of proving it the service rep didnt even bother pulling up the initial paperwork before abusing the renter of scratching the car another story i heard was a renter being charged a 1000 hold instead of the standard 500 but i guess there is no standard procedure here reps do as they please another irk is getting the car with half a tank and needing to return it the same i have never heard of a car rental requiring a half a tank of gas upon return honestly feels like a scam as well youll either overfill for them or come a little bit under and likely get charged for it failure on my part was not checking yelp before booking and since youre reading this review you didnt make the same mistake good for you,0.0

dr kelly england was very controlling and rude our questions were regarded as threatening i guess for one example my son was uncomfortable with a procedure and when i asked her why she needed to do it she made no attempt to be reassuring or give any information she just said it is my job i supported my son and asked her not to do it so she said i need to find another doctor in addition we had to wait in the lobby for 40 minutes and it was an hour total before we saw dr kelly england i have definitely experienced medical office staff that was far more professional and friendly than this office too the office we went to was1450 south dobson road suite b220i canceled my other kids appointments and we will never go back,0.0

the hotel experience was pretty great in my opinion there are various restaurants that visitors can dine in throughout the day  as well as an in door aquarium with a virtual reality experience that is perfect for kids of all ages during my stay i had one issue which occurred during the second day of our stay at the hotel  it was around 6 in the morning and my family and i were getting ready for our trip to the grand canyon  we tried to be as quiet as possible but it wasnt good enough for the people in the room next to us and they called hotel security with a noise complaint hotel security came up to our room to tell us that we were disturbing the people in the room next to us  when hotel security arrived to reprimand  us the person next door to us opened their room door to complain about how loud we were being but made sure to stay inside their room so we couldnt see their faces  after hotel security left we organized our selves and left for our trip  when we returned someone put a do not disturb sign on our door  and because of this our room was not cleaned for the day  we were livid and informed the hotel cleaning crew but we didnt see any results regardless our trip was a lot of fun asides from the issue we had with the people in the room next to us,1.0

my wife and little boy went to healing hearts around 100pm on 4132016 because my son had been throwing up vomiting and had a high fever son is almost 2 years old  my wife was not received by a doctor but by sonia the nurse practitioner and she diagnosed my son with having an ear infection sonia asked my wife which pharmacy she preferred my wife told her the walgreens on alma school and guadalupe  before leaving my wife asked for the prescription and the nurse said that they would call and order it in and to not worry about it that they would get it taken care of  around 445pm that same day my wife didnt hear anything from walgreens so she called the pharmacy and they said that nothing had been ordered yet  my wife knowing that healing hearts would close quickly called them and they said that it had been ordered at the walgreens on dobson and warner  my wife told them no and that it needed to be ordered at alma school and walgreens  later that evening we went to walgreens and we were told that they didnt have any record that the prescription had been ordered  worried we went to the other walgreens on dobson and warner and they said the same thing  thinking there may have been a mistake in the pharmacy company we even went to cvs but none of their locations showed anything was ordered  after driving around for an hour and a half i began to realize that healing hearts never ordered the prescription  healing hearts not only didnt order the perscription they lied about ordering it to put it simplymy son had a nasty fever all night the vomitings continued and he slept that night roughly an hour    the following morning 4142016 i called healing hearts to speak with a manager or doctor so that i could file a complaint  i spoke with tatiana who told me that sonia wouldnt be in until 930am and that the office manager vick and the doctor had a meeting and she would have them call me back  i asked who is responsible for ordering prescriptions and she told me it would be the doctornurse that attended usin this case sonia  i called the other location in gilbert to inquire about where i could file a complaint and said that all complaints needed to go through the chandler office administrator vick  i was transferred to his voicemailvick called me back and then in a defensive tone he proceeded to tell me that he shows that it was ordered electronically and that they would order it again to make sure it went through  who am i to hold responsible walgreens or healing hearts  there comes a certain point where you have to take responsible for your errors and mistakes dont blame the technology when your offices customer service is reprehensible    to say the least my family will never go back after experiencing what happened with healing hearts and sonia  i would not be surprised if this problem is just tip of the iceberg for the real issues happening thereyours truly a dissatisfied arizona parent,0.0

i drive a 2010 range rover sportmy check engine light came on  i took my truck to my local mechanic he advised me after scanning the car that i had a problem with 4 ignition coils and to take it to a land rover dealer as they have a land rover scanner and can give me better diagnosis i searched online for land rover mechanic  found birkshire automobiles advertising as a land rover dealer alternative i phoned them and i explained to them the situation they told me that they had a land rover scanner and it will tell them the exact problem after they scan my car more detailed report than the regular mechanic generic scanner i made the appointment and went there they scanned the car and the same results that i already knew were on their diagnosis report the only difference was in the bottom of the report it said customer to call us they charged me 1 hour labour and they refused to refund me they informed me that will contact their tech team in england and try and figure out  what the problem is and will get back to me within 3 days  i then called metro west authorized dealer and gave them the codes and they told me over the phone what needs to be fixed  i did give birkshire a 1 star because the washroom was very clean and sam spent a few minutes in my car showing me some controls however he didnt know all the controls and what they are made for  i advise any land rover owner to take their truck to the dealer at least for diagnosis at least for sure they know all the controls not half or so  hope you found my review helpful,0.0
wow what a waste of time this was  i went in with an honest picture of a divorce and problems up front  i asked to be preapproved before i started looking at cars with the understanding that this just might not happen  they were all friendly and respectful to my friend who went with me  he has a mechanics background  they shook his hand three times  i was the one buying the car and was never offered this common courtesy i really try not to be that kind of woman but then they tried to sell me a mustang that was posted on their internet inventory as clean and ready to go  it had been driven by the wife of one of the people who work there with major dents on the roof a rear bumper that had significant damage an obvious oil leak and a questionable carfax report  they wanted me to make a promise to buy it that they would clean it up and make it ready to go  we asked that if we were approved for that car and it didnt work out that the offer would be good for another car of that price  they said yes but they wanted me to sign that i would buy that car hmmmm  couldnt test drive it and it had problems  well they brought out the credit guy who once again talked to my friend instead of me and shook his hand twice but not mine  the numbers did not match what was advertised at all  there was 1000 added on to the price now making a car that had a kelley blue book value of 3400 from 6700 to 7700  they said the higher price was a loan fee  i was sitting under the sign that said we use kelley blue book values to price our cars  obviously not the same blue book the rest of us usethe moral of this story is do your homework to know the value of your purchase before you buy from these guys and ladies you might want to bring a guy with you so you dont have to shake their hands either,0.0

disgusting the hotel was super dirty the bathroom floor looked like it had been cleaned with barbwire there was a water stain that looked like it had been there for years in the corner of the room so old it looked like possible black mold the tv would go red with no picture periodically i would not care about the tv but i was traveling with my kids and tv is like crack the closet door and toilet were not working properly the list goes on the entire hotel smelled like weed from the employees to the rooms i could go on about the amazing front desk customer service sarcasm but there is not enough time,0.0
i would definitely recommend to any expecting mommies to consider giving birth here just got discharged yesterday got admitted monday night and my stay here was amazing the nurses were very positive helpful and always with a smile on their face it was my first born and i needed a lot of help with latching my baby on to breastfeed all the nurses were very helpful and understanding i wish i wouldve remembered their real names but one was pamela  day shift  and the other was tess  night shift    no matter how many times i would call them for help they never got bothered and that made me feel very comfortable being a new mom if i ever get pregnant again i would most definitely be chosing sunrise  ,1.0

stopped in once to ask about my laptop battery not charging i had read dell diagnostics and support threads but wanted to take it in first before i got into buying parts the visit was probably 10 minutes and the guy at the counter literally just turned the computer on to see the not charging message turned it off and directed me to batteries plus needless to say i was a bit surprised but i thought maybe he was trying to save me some money so off to batteries plus i go where the only battery they had in stock wasnt a complete match and did not work on my system they offered to order me a replacement battery for 170 but i figured i could get a better deal online so i ordered a replacement battery and ac adapter just in case both come and i try them with no success my computer wont recognize the new battery while testing all this i realized that there was a bios update i needed but wouldnt run because my dell battery didnt have enough charge and the replacement battery wasnt recognized so i went back to data doctors with all the parts and explanation of what i had found i suppose i should have turned around as soon as they couldnt take my credit card info because their router was down not good for an itcomputer company to have it issues for some reason they asked to keep the replacement ac adapter but not the replacement battery only to call me 2 days later and ask for the battery never mind that their hours mean i am late to work if i have to stop by so by friday afternoon after having my computer for 5 days i called to check on it because 5 days seemed like an awful long time to have my laptop they told me almost word for word what i told them was the problem on day 1 the diagnosis was that i needed a dell battery and not a generic replacement it took them 5 days to tell me that they also told me they had discovered some trojan viruses on my computer i was skeptical since i have been shelling out money to mcafee for years so when i got my computer back i ran a scan which came back negative but when looking at the scanning history i was reminded that mcafee did find 4 viruses 2 years ago and had quarantined themi am glad i got my laptop back when i did and am sorry i didnt ask for a refund because the only thing data doctors did for me was prevent me from having a usable laptop for a week i certainly dont need them to order me a dell battery when i can do that myself i was under the mistaken idea that a computer repair company would have spare parts to test systems so that i could have diagnosed the issue before having to go out an replace parts one by one i should have called my companys it department back in virginia because they would have been more helpfuli cant speak to other locations but i will never patronize the ahwatukee store again i did ultimately resolve the problem when i found phx cpu since i had pretty much done all my own diagnostics i realized it was either the dc power jack or motherboard thankfully it was the former and phx cpu replaced my power jack and my laptop is running perfectly again,0.0

first visit in and it was not a good one at all i decided to try a carnitas torta for those unaware basically a pork sandwich mexican style it seemed as though they had no idea what to do first the guy up front walks me through what i want on it then he hands it off to some mysterious person in the back my gf gets the veggie burrito we also used the special yelp offer for an order of the free mini churros the girl at the cash register was very nice but seems a bit stumped by the whole ordeal so we are told to sit down and they will bring me my torta the gf is about 23s of the way through with her veggie burrito when my torta magically arrives at our table all the while her veggie burrito is starting to fall apart from all of the juicesoil we arent sure i unwrap my torta to discover it is one sloppy congealed mess not very appetizing to look at and fell apart at my 1st bite flavor was ok but the whole thing was just a disaster i took it back up and had them make me a carnitas burrito it was marginally better but the same as with my gfs veggie burrito it fell apart about halfway through and thats about as much as i ate we dumped the remainder into the trash and agreed never to visit a chronic taco ever againthen the store manager came out he knew we had a bad experience and wanted to know what all went wrong he also informed us that this store was the numero uno location in all of chronic taco we told him everything as written above he also said he was in there with his family trying to have lunch and it was a miserable failure at best he was a nice enough guy and offered for us to come back at another time after he addresses the issues all free of charge not that is the right thing to do but honestly theres a whole lotta fixin needs to happen before that place is right maybe we will check it out again and give them another chance but i highly doubt it investors if this is the best store they have get your money out fast because that ship is sinking,0.0

06182014 approximately 630pmtuesday wings at bookers  lb of wings for 499they smoke the wingsthey had me at this selling point  so a group of 10 at a tablenow before i go on further this turned out to be one of the worst wing nights weve ever had  it even came to the point we were outside talking about how we will do our next chicken fry for july or august  so for the few of us drinks came for others they were waiting for quite a bitmeaning 2025 minutes  so not really starting off with a good experienceso finally our drinks came and we look over the menu  everyone was coming to an agreement they were ready to order  unfortunately we were not attended to for 20 minutes  this caused for one of us to approach the bar to have the bartender send over the waitress  that took another 20 minutes til we got our order takenso we gave our orders to the waitress  keep in mind its 16 orders of wings  there were 2 entree orders 5 side orders of jalapeno mac and cheese and an order of fries  not to bad of an order for the night and drinksso by now its coming to an hour and 15 minutes we are antsy for our food  our waitress came out to tell us our food is coming and explained that instead of individual plates for the wings it would be grouped  this meaning wings would be on a platter  she also indicated the wings are not tossed in sauce individual sauce cups will be givenso we nod and smile and finally the food starts coming out they give 3 platters of wings and a platter of various sauces in a cup  for the people who ordered salt and pepper wings the shakers are in the middle of the table  salt and pepper the wings themselvesfail  the girl who dropped off the sauces to us didnt even take the time to tell us which sauce was which  buffalo carolina kansas city or maple bourbonfail  dont get me wrong i think we were able to figure the sauces out from samplingso as we are eating we notice that the wings were gone pretty fast  now out of the 10 of us 6 of us order 2 lbs of wings  now dont think we were being petty but the amount of wings we ate in total came up to approx 75 wings  i asked the waitress how many wings usually come with a pound  she advised 810 wings  so in my calculation that would be based on 8 wings each 128 pieces  so if  we are counting wings per the manager we are still short 51 wings  as the waitress was about to clear our table i asked her about the wings and that we may short wings as customer  she asked if we wanted more but we decided that what ever was brought out to us they can charge what was not brought just take it off the bill15 minutes later this guy with his ball cap backwards approaches us  he indicated he was the manager cool brought to his attention we might short of wings in our order  he gave us the same option for them to bring out the remaining wings or what we would like  we just asked if they could remove the wings that were not brought out  he then turned and may have muttered the fbomb  i wasnt the only one who heard but also another personso we are sitting at our table the table hasnt been cleared  we are waiting for our bill  the waitress comes and asks how many orders need to come off the bill  we didnt know what to say as how do you measure a pound out by wings that are already eaten  so we went off by their estimates of wings per order ratio  810  unfortunately an agreement could not be made of how many orders to be taken off  so essentially it was agree 8 orders of wings to be charged  so the waitress was gonna seperate the bill  the bill came back with us being charged 9 orders  we asked if it was 8 and she said she would make the correctionanother 20 minutes roll and the manager comes back and asks if we have finished counting wingsseriously ok yah i can take a joke  but i cant speak for the other people and it came down to 2 guys at our table vs the manager i was stuck in between  so the manager was saying we wanted him to take off another order of wings  he even said he already taken off half the bill  umm lets see 5 bucks times 8 orders40thats not half the orders we made  pretty much he indicated to us he will get the bill corrected and have us leave their establishmentreally  ok so yah we were not feeling it so we got the bill which the waitress seperated for us  there were issues with certain orders mixed with other peoples billslets just pay and get the hell outso after reading this i hope you didnt spend 2 hours and 30 minutes reading this because that was how long it was for our experience with bookers  you know whats even funny before we even went talked about the all you can eat crab special  sundays 4295 not no more  3 of us that were planning on going  thats approx 12600 for food plus drinks and tip not being spent theregod bless and happy eatingsomewhere else,0.0
i dont typically leave negative reviews unless i am super dissatisfied or very very disappointed  my husband and i came in for a full body massage we originally wanted the 1 hour massage price on the board was 36 so we thought okay thats fine then the guy up front said how about 75 minutes more for 3 more i said okay sure what the heck its only three dollars more and considering the reviews it was supposedly great so i go to alot of massage places and what i tend to do is i look at the time right before they put their hands on me in this case it was 350 pm so im counting the 75 minutes after which should be roughly 405 pm the staff is nice understandable  they had me soak my feet in the bucket im asian so i go to a whole lot of asian massage places when they tell you to stick your foot in the bucket first its considered a foot massage which is usually cheaper the other asian places when i ask for full body im laying on my back with a sheet over me and they literally spend 40 minutes on my back and maybe the remaining 20 for the entire body when he walked in again i asked him again this is a deep tissue back massage right or full body not foot massage  he said yes yes we do back 30 minutes of course the girl that was massaging my husband didnt understand a lick of english so she couldnt respond so i was thinking okay maybe they do it differently so we went on with it  during the massage my massage guy grant it hes nice but business is business if you dont have time to sit and do my massage you should get someone else or get someone else to tend the front desk  he kept walking in and out throughout my massage which couldve cut off a good 10 minutes and no it wasnt to get the supplies because when i look over to my husband his girl was still massaging him he would come back to apologize for leaving so i said no prob but also thinking oh maybe hell make up the time in the endanyhow time goes by when i had to flip on my belly so my back is up i took a glance at the clock again and i was thinking okay theres technically 25 minutes left so hell probably use the remaining  for the back he only rubbed my back didnt get under the shoulder blades didnt single out any muscle areas he literally just rubbed up and down my back with both hands thats all didnt work in sections like others do so when they say okay done i asked aloud that was 75 minutes he responds yeah i looked over to the clock and it was just barely tipping past 450 pm that was 60 minutes not 75 i looked over to my husband and said that wasnt even our full time so im thinking im just going to tip 5 each but since i didnt have two 5 bills i had a 10 and 5 so 750 each now because this is not what we expected and even considering giving tip should be good already thinking back how i didnt even get my full time with him walking away and coming back so when we walk to the front the girl gave us the 60 minute price my guy corrected her and says in chinese no it was the 75 minute so she charged me for that  then she asked cash or credit for tip we said cash and handed them the 15 to split because at this point im displeased with my service usually i always tip 10 not in this case  when we handed the cash the guy said something else in chinese and she turns to me and says oh we have a 10 minimum tipping policy i thought what the fuck you have got to be fucking kidding me so i just looked to my hubs and told him whatever  just give it to them so we can gonow thinking back i shouldnt have given them anything  not only did you get my service wrong i ask for back massage not foot spa you didnt spend my whole 75 minutes on me in fact you cut our time short and now that im even giving you something you are telling me how much i have to tip you  i was really looking forward to this massage too therefore they get this long 1 star review because ive never been soooo disappointed in a massage place ever,0.0

this update is for the dayclub my friend and i came here on a weekday we got in free and it was pretty quiet but the music was good and there were plenty of places to lay out a server explained that since it was slow we could sit anywhere we wanted except in the cabanas she was also very careful to explain that if they filled up and people came in who wanted to pay for the seats and daybeds theyd have to start bumping people no problem and props for being upfront about it we took over a daybed that was right at the edge of the water the pool area is a bit on the small side but not nearly as small as tao and azure the music was good drinks were about what we expected to pay the server was really awesome we only left because we got hungry and since it started getting cloudy we got a little cold if you want to get a lot of sun i suggest staying on the side that you walk in from the other side gets shaded by the building a lot which is good if youre looking for shade well definitely be back,1.0

this place usually isnt one of my go to sandwich spots but i was craving one of their smoothies so i decided i would give it another try since their food isnt too bad either i came in around 230 after my shift at work and decided to get the turkey artichoke sandwich that ive had before that i enjoyed very much i ordered it with no mayo onions or the pickle on the side due to my strong dislike for them i waited patiently while they made my sandwich and while i was in no rush i sipped on the delicious pink pia colada smoothie on this hot summer day i noticed some other customers that were in my view walked up behind the counter because the guy apparently wanted more tea and there werent any filled up by the beverage station the guy who might have been a manager since he was wearing a headset seemed very annoyed that they did that i agree it was rude to walk back there without asking but what does he expect when the teas for the customers werent filled at the beverage station the man responded to him just saying itll take 15 minutes to make more no apologies were given to the man in need of some more tea the girl who originally took my order brought me my sandwich and i politely thanked her and got up and checked my sandwich just due to past experiences to make sure everything looked right before i left the place unfortunately the pickle was still in there so i immediately threw it in the nearest trash can and also checked my sandwich to make sure the pesto butter was on there because theyve left it off multiple times before i went to the front and asked the cashier just to confirm that it does come with pesto and she didnt seem too sure so she asked the same man who was wearing the headset and he stated that its a pesto butter and i said that i was aware because ive gotten it before and it didnt look like it was on there instead of just apologizing and giving me an extra side and letting me on my way the man asked the baker or the girl who was making the sandwiches in the back if she put it on there and she yelled back in an angry tone yes and the guy looked back at me and said  she said she put it on there i just looked at both of them very confused because i was so surprised of how they handled this just to be clear i was not upset until i received the worst customer service i couldve possibly gotten i wasnt expecting anything but just an extra side of the pesto butter but they just made me feel like i was a burden to them even though no one was in line behind me so i wasnt preventing them from helping someone else i work in the food industry and they clearly couldve known that since i was wearing my work uniform and i deal with peoples requests all day long and since this was something so minor and how they dealt with this it made me never want to come here again this isnt the first time the employees have showed poor customer service but this is definitely the worst by far one star for the smoothie but id rather take my business elsewhere next time for better customer service,0.0

im not sure how it took my wife  i so long to find this place before visiting the quiet storm i didnt realize that their entire menu was vegetarian but that shouldnt be much of a problem even for fans of meat i ordered the maelstrom which is a what i would call a mediterranean quesadilla the flavor was subtle but delicious there were plenty of menu options and it looks like this restaurant is really doing its part to support the local community the only complaint i would have was that the temperature also got a bit cold as we were sitting by the door and it was winter finally remember to bring enough cash to cover the bill as thats the only way to pay i was not disappointed by the quiet storm and will definitely be getting back to this place next time im in pittsburgh,1.0

i visited this restaurants a couple of weeks ago on a sunday i ordered a breakfast burrito and was greatly disappointed it looked like it had been slopped together the scrambled egg was overly raw and it was topped off with a tomato sauce that tasted like pizza topping tomato sauce it was accompanied by rice and beans the rice was cold and the beans were extremely dry cracked beans i was unable to finish my meal and later that evening had a huge stomach ache it was a huge gastronomical mistake i dont recommend this restaurant under any conditions,1.0
id love to leave a good review based on my expectations however i never even got my house cleaned i put in a request through yelp for a quote  was upfront from the beginning that i have cats i was told to go to the website to secure the estimate and was even given a code for 20 off which was really appreciated  i got the quote booked the appointment for first thing monday morning yay and then had a question about how theyd charge my card i guess i entered my card info wrong so it was showing declined which was no big deal then today 24 hours before im expecting them to come i get a message that the only teams he has available for the next several weeks are highly allergic to cats i mean i get that people can be allergic to cats but 1 when i initially contacted this company he should have said that and 2 if youre going to a run a business where your teams of employees have to go into homes it is very likely that some of those homes will have cats so you should either a make it clear on the website or b hire people who arent allergic now its the day before i was supposed to have my house cleaned and i dont have anyone coming like i thought before an event,0.0

this review is for water chestnut which is their ramen menu offered thursday  saturday evenings ive been here twice for ramen and it is so delicious they have a buildyourown type style where you can choose the broth type of noodle protein and toppings both times ive had the chinese sausage with garlic shoyu soft egg  nori and it was awesome the sausage while not a traditional ingredient is sweet and savory and adds a nice amount of flavor i find the portions size to be decent i havent been able to finish their craft cocktails are also very inventive with fresh ingredients while my husband and i were finishing our dinner the chef came out to ask how everything was she then told us that everything is homemade including the dumpling skins we will definitely have to come back and try some of the smaller bites next time,1.0

stopped by here to lower my ears due to my mop getting a tad bit unbearable the stylist was rather friendly and like some other reviews on this place yes the stylist are hawt although that doesnt help worth a darn if your stylist doesnt pay attention to what theyre doing and they give you a reversed mohawk prior to getting my noggin cropped i explained in detail as to what i wanted done and the stylist did the complete opposite i would strongly advise not going here if you like you hair if youre one of those people whos into the chemo look well then by all means make this place your new personal hang out,0.0

great barber shop not much more needs saying but i will ive been a long time customer of one of the barbers there joe and was happy to follow him when he moved here why well he gives one hell of a flattop thats why this cut is a little tricky for some people but not for him its perfect every time i dont know about the other barbers there because i only let joe touch my hairthe place is tastefully decorated it feels a little like what i imagine an old school barber shop might have been like but more modern of course everyone is friendly and you feel like they all know what theyre doing they offer various services and the prices are posted a board i just usually get a cut i do get a warm towel on the head and then a massage afterwards which adds to the overall experience but not to the cost its those extras that i really like at this point ive been there a dozen times or more ive never waited for my appoint not once thats awesome for those of us who are on the go and need to get in and out call ahead i imagine its a time saver what can i say love this place and hope its around a very very long time,1.0

my husband and i had always wanted to try this place one day last week we finally did and i must say that it was not a pleasant experience they had just opened it was lunch time there was music blaring throughout we could barely hear the server who greeted us she was semi friendly but rushed us through when there was nobody else even behind us  i get it they just opened however a supposed to be texasbarbecue restaurant should be playing something a little more fitting to their style their personality should be a little more inviting im not asking for ellie mae but sheesh they definitely have some stuff to work on now to address the prices and food all ambience aside the prices are way too high for the quality and stemware that their food is served upon the salad i had was not fresh anyone can open up a bag of salad toss it on a small black plastic plate sprinkle a little beans and oh i forgot to mention the whole 2 to 3 ounces of meat dabbled on top and call it a salad did i forget to mention they charge you 925 for it yesyes they did my husband had a 2 meat plate of flavorless meat they charged 13 for that i will say his portion size was much larger however flavorless semi dry meat is much less to ever be desired again their sauce is vinegar based and has a distinct taste of plastic in the sticky overused bottles they sat in on the sticky plastic tables my husband and i later that afternoon experienced some stomach discomfort for sure i come from the south and yall definitely have a thing or two to learn about hospitality barbecue and pricing we will not be returning and have let our friends know also they should not waste their money on this place they can find much better value service and food at rudys or dickeys,0.0

one of the best pubs i have been to in toronto a top place to have a beer before or after a show in the entertainment district  i went here after having seen a show at the princess of wales theatre book of mormon for those interested with a large group of people and they had no problem finding a place for us on the second levelthe place has an awesome beer selection they advertise 50 on tap and i am sure it is close to that although a few of them were out  the beers are mostly european ones with only a couple of ontario microbrews but the options they have are great and none of them are molson or labatt swill which earns brownie points in my book  our waitress was really friendly and helpful and she knew a lot about the beers and was able to offer good suggestions   there were no problems on the food side either i had mussels and spicy sausage which were really tasty while everyone else had something they enjoyed as well  be warned the steak sandwich is just a steak on a bun as opposed to the traditional steak strips which can be a bit tricky for people with small mouths  next time i am in toronto and if i find myself in the entertainment district again i would definitely come back here,1.0

thank goodness i dont have a car anymore and dont have to deal with these clownsback when i moved into pgh i did have a car and obtained the residential permit necessary to park in my neighborhood n oakland  go figure when i went to the office to do so the meter i first tried to park at was broken and wouldnt accept any of my quarters  this is back in the day when the old meters still existed  i should have recognized this as a metaphor for ppas dysfunctionality  as it were i just reported it to themas anyone whos ever been to n oakland knows parking there is a real pita and the street that my apt bldgs on doesnt even have parking  one day about two weeks later after parking in one of my normal spots i went to my car only to see a ticket on the windshield  what the heck i thought since i had my residential permit prominently displayed  turns out i was parked within twenty feet of a crosswalk  i wasnt aware this rule even existed but apparently it does  way to welcome me to the neighborhood pghsince i was new to town and id heard that pgh parking court is a joke i decided to contest the ticket  it took me three calls to even get someone to answer the phone to sign up for a court date since you couldnt schedule one yourself through their website  i scheduled my hearing for an evening session about a month laterbefore i was ever able to go to court a flood happened and totaled my car making me even angrier about the situation  i went to court with the plan of asking for leniency given that i was new to town and newly carless  when it was my turn i took one look at the judge a portly and sternlooking elderly woman and knew i wasnt going to get off  i didnt even get to finish my sob story before she cut me off  it isnt our fault you didnt know the rules and that your cars wrecked she said  good thing i had enough cash on me to pay the fine since i dont think they even took credit cardsdont believe the stories about pgh parking court judges taking pity on you because you took time out of your day to show up and contest a ticket regardless of the reason for it  that court is a kangaroo court and theyre out to do one thingmake money  be aware of the more obscure laws which include not only parking too close to crosswalks but also headin parking only  check the parking signs carefully feed the meters and observe the time limits and hopefully you wont have the misfortune of dealing with these idiots  youve been warnedi wont even get into the exorbitance of their rates downtown and in oakland  their slogan the value parking network is laughable and downright disingenuous,0.0

this review is solely for their dumplings and i am obsessed with them their pork dumplings are my favorite and i usually get them pan fried very tasty and juicy almost reminds me the little soup dumplings aka xiao long bao they make their dumplings freshly by hand and although they only have three options you can ask them if they could provide something else for you i havent done this personally just because i already know i want their pork dumplings i do order something else to try alongside my dumplings just so im not too biased i have tried three of their fruit smoothies and you can tell that they actually are drinks made from actual fruit none of that powder stuff staff members are attentive and give amazing servicewhich is rare at a chinese restaurant the boss already recognized me my second visit so their dumplings  the recognition makes me keep coming here,1.0

i dont think ill ever be as satisfied and happy with a hotel as we were with this onethis was the absolute best hotel weve ever experienced the whole stay was amazing i loved everything about our room and the size of it the view and the bathroom was impeccable the bathtub was huge also inside the shower a very modern feelthe view is absolutely breathtaking since its one of the only hotels off of the strip the view of the strip is amazing that would be the only inconvenience of the whole hotel many taxi rides you can walk to the strip but its a looong walk its better to go across the street to the rio and take the shuttle from there to harrahs thats your best shot since theres three hotels that make up the palms youll never really be bored there the palms place is where you should stay pricewise for your room the palms casino is just a short walkway from there the actual casino floor of the palms isnt extremely impressive its smaller than i expected but of course it gets the job done for gambling the restaurants in the palms are topnotch n9ne steakhouse was todiefor best steak ive ever had they have a cafeteria in the palms casino and it comes in handy when youre on your way back to your room for a late night snack the pizza place in that section of the casino is pretty impressive we ordered a pizza around 2 in the morning and took it back to our roomthe lovely cleaning room attendants cleaned our room everyday to the extreme but not so much that i felt uncomfortable with them touching all of our things and they left presents for us everyday chocolates robes flowers they really were amazing you cant use your balcony anymore because you cant use any balcony anymore in vegas which is upsetting now because that would have been beautiful to sit out on at night but still the view was just as beautiful from the door i really was surprised by all of the bad reviews i read on them before writing this i really dont even have a complaint and it just seems odd that so many people had such a drastically different experience than us i can only go off of our experience which was amazing its going to be hard for another hotel to live up to my standards of this one from here on outthats for sure,1.0

my boyfriend and his family are huge los angeles kings hockey fans every year the kings play a preseason game in las vegas and it always falls on my birthday weekend  this year mom wanted to join us so she could celebrate my birthday weekend with me  to celebrate my birthday she took me and my boyfriend out to dinner at roys at 730p on september 28 2012  i had an awesome birthday experiencewe were lead to our table and handed customized birthday menus announcing my birthday  this customized approach really adds to the reasons of why im glad i chose roys as my birthday dinner place  our waiter thomas made for a very welcoming experience his personality makes you feel as if you are right at home he was very attentive and informative and was able to accurately describe all the dishes we asked about and make them seem tantalizing  he also peaked our interest with some of the specials he described  throughout the meal we never had to want for anything as he was always available to serve uswe decided we could order a few plates and share a bit as wellto start the lobster california roll  i order variations of this roll at many places i frequent and roys did not disappoint  also the portion was a very good amount so that we were all able to share and there was still a piece or two leftmy mom  shellfish sampler the lobster tail was huge and very meaty  it melted in your mouth  the scallops we so tasty and also huge the crab cake recipe was delicious  the curry sauce drizzled over the meal was flavorful and just the right amount of spicysmokey taste they should really bottle and sell that stuff normally i dont go for alot of carbs but i couldnt stop eating the macadamia nut pesto risotto from her plate  strawberry daiquiri  how could you go wrong with this  and roys did not disappoint me  lilikoi pear salad i love their candied macadamia nuts i was eating a salad but it definitely felt like i was cheating there was plenty of gouda cheese in the salad unlike some restaurants who want to skimp on the expensive cheese  the asian pears went great with the salad and the dressing balanced it all outdeloach pinot noir from california  i loved this wine  it was rich and had a slightly sweet red cherry or blackberry hint to itmy bf  pan seared trout  again the portion of the meat was more than expected this fish was flaky and smooth  the sauces and side dish pairings were detectiblethe jalepeno margarita  we are tequila drinkers and our favorite mixed drink would probably be the margarita  this is why this menu item piqued our interest  this is definitely not your normal margarita but if you are in the mood to try something different it is one that i would recommendthe chocolate molten cake was very decadent  the only problem was that i was stuffed as the meal went on and on i was getting so full but yet all the food was so delicious that i couldnt stop taking small bites of everything  by the time the chocolate molten cake arrived i could only squeeze in 3 or 4 bites  even as full as i was it was the best chocolate molten cake i have ever had  it was just crispy enough on the outside with a pool of creamy chocolate inside of light and fluffy cake  so rich but still edible i would definitely recommend roys for any occasion  friends in town birthday anniversary or just looking for some place to eat where you know you will get detectible food of good portions no matter what you order exceptional service and attentive staff plus a lovely ambiance,1.0

selling a home while you are out of state seemed to be a large undertaking  i had a property in phoenix that i decided was time to sell as i currently live in wa and travel extensively for work  i turned to yelp to help me find the gluch group  i called as they had so many positive reviews and was able to meet with one of their agents and get an idea of their marketing strategy team approach and estimated value for my home  i decided to list the home with them and they really came through  the transaction had some tough spots along the way but everyone on the team kept me up to date and informed about what my options were and what was next  i really appreciated how well the team worked together and how seamless the whole thing was  i was able to sell the property without coming into phoenix and that was a big success in my eyes,1.0

this was by far the worst hotel i have stayed in on the strip and definitely not the cheapest  the lady at the registration desk was not friendly at all  we got into our room and were immediately not impressed  the room was very dark  there was a small desk light and one end table lamp  there was also a large lamp in the corner but it was not plugged in for some reason  it did work though once we found the problem  there was also some running lights around the room that did not work at all  there was a missing drawer and missing doors in the dresser  there was only one single accessible outlet which we discovered later also didnt work  we complained about the light at the front desk within an hour after checking in  the desk clerk offered to move our room but insinuated that it wouldnt get any better  he did supposedly place a work order for the lights although we never saw or heard from anybody and they were never fixed  after showering the next day i discovered there was no hair dryer in the room  they brought me one the next day and it did not work  after spending three nights in the hotel i was finally able to actually dry my hair  we were staying at ph on new years eve and our friends that were travelling with us received information in their rooms about the street closing but that was not provided to us  we also learned from visiting other rooms that our room was also missing an end table lamp  some other minor details that im sure bothered me more based on our terrible experiencethe furniture was haphazardly placed blocking access to the window our bed was not made on the last day there were two closets but only one had hangars  the location is good but i definitely recommend staying elsewhere  there are plenty of options on the strip many priced more reasonably than ph,0.0

6 months ago i received bad customer service from this facility specifically from the office manager i decided to give this practice another chance so i called to schedule an appointment and i was denied services because i posted a yelp review of my experience at this office i was told that they will only schedule me an appointment if i took down my yelp post who is running this facility obviously a manager that does not know how to conduct proper customer service instead of starting over and maybe speaking with me at my appointment about our misunderstanding this manager ordered her staff to deny me services and tried to force me to take down my review it is apparent that they didnt take any advise from my post 6 months ago when i suggested a retraining course on customer service i refused to take down my review because it was my opinion of this facility based on the way i was being treated hopefully this reaches the ceo of the facility so he or she can see how their employees are treating customers they are the face a reflection of this company i would hope they take to this review and get it together sincerely candice sanders,0.0

we absolutely love pusadees it is tied with nickys thai kitchen as our favorite thai restaurant in pittsburgh it breaks our hearts when they close for the winter but we know that come spring we will be enjoying their delicious food once again we have eaten in and done takeout here many times so this review is much overdue  takeout service is always quick and efficient we are usually enjoying our meals within 30 minutes after calling and picking up compare this to thai place in aspinwall which always gave us a 45 minute wait due to being busy but never had anyone eating in the restaurant when we arrived the indoor space is sparse but functional there are simple tables and chairs and not much decorations on the walls their outdoor space is gorgeous and generally what people go for when eating here the garden is lovely and relaxing with lights strung up around the beams and simple plants making the space inviting and relaxing we attempted to eat outside yesterday but gave way to the heat and ended up indoors someday soon we will enjoy our bottle of wine in the gardenwe typically order two different dishes and share we start out with the fresh garden rolls which are delicious it is a small order but the perfect start to a meal the vinegar sauce is light and refreshing but i do prefer the peanut sauce that nickys offers with their spring rolls we have had the red green and pumpkin curries and our favorite is the green the sauce is more complex than the pumpkin even though we love the pumpkin chunks there are numerous fresh vegetables in each that soak up the wonderful sauce we also share an order of brown rice which is worth the extra cost i recently had thai in nyc and i have to say that i loved the curry at pusadees much better their blend of spices and coconut milk is simply perfect pusadees and nickys will continue to be our favorite thai places here i am so glad that pittsburgh has more and more options for great thai dining,1.0

awful is an understatement i have had issues with my brakes since having this shop work on them just over a year ago  only less than 5000 miles ago i approached manager rich gerber at the counter with my receipt from my last service there feeling that the work may have not been done properly causing the issue mr gerber took my receipt and then had people look at the vehicle explaining that he would look it over then come back to tell you what the cost will be i found this odd to begin with  if this was not good work there should be no cost when he returned to tell me what was up he began with our labor is only guaranteed for 90 days and proceeded to explain that somehow the exact same issue i had them fix less than 5000 miles ago had mysteriously occurred again as he explained the issue he continued to revert to our labor is only guaranteed for 90 days in addition to the same issue recurring there were new issues with other brakes that they either failed to notice on the first trip or couldve been exacerbated by their failure to fix the first issue correctly the first time i got stuck paying 1000 no discount on labor not even an apology one of the other workers there confided in me that they knew i had to correct the same issue twice and shouldnt have and that he understood my frustration and anger he admitted it i am pursuing legal action and will be contacting the better business bureau as well if you care about service and dont like being taken advantage of avoid this place,0.0

i no longer go to this starbucks its unfortunate because it is very convenient to stop here on my way to work there is one girl who works morning with curly hair and if i always got her id continue to go here but every other employee ive encountered there needs to get out of customer service and quickon my first visit i intended to order an iced caramel macchiato the girl with the curly hair gave me a hot one i couldnt remember for sure that id said iced so i accepted it without comment she thanked me told me to have a nice day smiled handed me my drink and i was on my wayon my second visit i got the curly haired girl again very similar to my first visit except my drink was made like i wanted i was happyon my third visit i was in a hurry so i decided to skip the drive thru and go inside i was actually in such a hurry that i just ordered iced coffee the couple that had been in front of me got their drinks so i thought id be on my way soon the male half of the couple got the baristas attention to let him know the drink was made wrong by this time i realized id made a mistake by stopping because i was going to be late so i got a female baristas attention not the curly haired girlshe has straight blondish gold hair and told her that i had to go and i just didnt want them to worry about making my drink i promise you i was in no way rude it wasnt their fault that i was in a hurry i was just planning on forfeiting the 3 id paid the older guy behind her asked me if id had the iced coffee he sounded aggravated i said yes so the girl made it quickly and gave it to me she was also clearly annoyed i thanked them thoroughly and told them that that was unexpected but appreciated they didnt reply my last visit was in the drive thru again again they were very busy i ordered an iced caramel macchiato again the older guy was at the window this time he handed me a hot caramel macchiato since i was certain id said iced i nicely told him that i had ordered an iced one he was obviously annoyed he said oh and took it back they then poured the hot one over ice and gave it back to me no apology or thank you ora asking me if it was okay that they just poured the hot one over icejust a here you go so that will be my last visit there i hope the owner realizes what crap some of his employees are before everyone is like me and stops going there,0.0

if i could give 0 stars i would heres a tip stay somewhere else its not as if there arent plenty of other hotels in the area i had to stay here there was a convention i had to attend for work taking place at this location the conference will most likely be here next year too and ill make sure to stay somewhere else the food is gross and overpriced the service was not good as soon as we landed we attempted to locate the free shuttle that they advertise for bringing guests from the airport to the hotel when we couldnt locate it we called the hotel and they told us that the shuttle had to be reserved 24 hours in advance and it was full for the day he was incredibly rude and in hindsight he should have prepared me for the customer service standard this hotel holdsthe worst part of my stay here was the customer service or lack thereof the temperature was in triple digits so we decided to try the pool there are two pools one large one  and one smaller one that is probably for kids and when we got there the larger pool was fairly empty we laid by the pool for a little and then i started to climb in the pool after a few minutes of wading around a life guard whistled at me apparently they were cleaning the pool and guests werent allowed in due to the presence of chemicals no sign nothing stating this i would have appreciated some type of warning before stepping into a contaminated pool apparently filled with cleaning chemicals but oh well after i got out i noticed other guests making the same mistake and i even heard one remark why isnt the pool roped offso everyone starts gathering in the smaller pool not even 15 minutes later everyone is kicked out of that pool as well apparently it was also contaminated lovely and once again no warning sign no roped off area again i saw many people walk into it not knowing it was contaminated eventually we went up to the room because it was clear we wouldnt get any time in the poolwe decided to come back later at night to use the hot tub and relax there is one hot tub with a sign at the entrance clearly stating no children under the age of 16 allowed in hot tub area however there was absolutely no one enforcing it so the hot tub was overrun with children splashing and swimming as if they were in the pool we asked the life guard if there were indeed children allowed in the hot tub and he assured us they were not and then he asked them to leave one parent became belligerent about his child not being allowed in the hot tub and the life guard had to call security not exactly the relaxing atmosphere one would hope for as soon as the life guard left the hottub once again became filled with children so we left when i got back to the room i called the front desk to tell them i was disappointed by the events described above she was not sympathetic and actually told me that it was my fault for not asking the staff to ask the children to leave the hot tub when i told her that i did and it didnt help she then told me i should have called her instead she then proceeded to tell me that there was nothing she could do about it but would i like a 15 food credit to my room i would have much rather appreciated a caringunderstandingapologetic customer service representative and no food credit rather than receiving a measly 15 food credit and having to deal with the rude and condescending representative tldrrude staff save yourself the headache and stay somewhere else dont plan on using the pool even when its 100 degrees this place is cheap and you get what you pay for,0.0

after a night on fremont st at 2 am a bowl of oxtail soup is as good as it gets we had a 5 minute wait at the most to get in and no complaints with the service the soup was the perfect ending to a great night the vegetables were soft the meat  fell off the bone and the cartilage at the ends of the bones was jelly after i cleared some space at the top of the bowl by slurping some of the broth and removing the bones 8 i ordered another order of rice and put it all in the soup i took my time and  spent the next 20 minutes savoring each spoonful of my oxtailrice soupthis will continue to be choice a if i find myself downtown late night,1.0

dont see vicki for measurements she took care of both my mother and mother in laws measurements for  their dresses both came in completely too big or too small to me it seemed to be an obvious up sell for alterations as it was mentioned 10 times in conversation  i understand some dresses need alterations most the time but these were way off  just a tactic to make a bigger profit off of you my mother in law was close to tears the day she went in to try on her dress vicki had the oh well attitude and jumped right to saying no returns or refunds to make the situation worse she spoke over us and was not listening to my mother in laws needs or to hear how truly disappointed she was horrible experience i also had ordered 7 bridesmaids dresses that took 4 months i would call to check status and be told i would get a phone call back never happened  this was more than once  i had to finally go in to get an answer i would not recommend this place to anyone brides  the almond tree has beautiful gowns better prices and amazing customer service,0.0

the skinny a symphony in your mouth nuff said 5 service there really isnt much service here  counter service only and they only have two small tables to eat atna value expensive for the size but oh so worth it 5now let me preface this review these treats are japanese in style in general i find that asian pastries tend to be a little less sweet rich and dense it is its own esthetic that not everyone will be a fan of so if youre looking for a really gooey chocolate chip cookie or a slice of uber luxurious cheesecake youll probably be disappointed you have been warnedah  what can i say about suzuya pastries hidden behind a quick lube joint you probably would miss it if you were driving too fast limited parking is also an issue due to the numerous shops a nail salon the quick lube etc in such a small retail spacebut no matter a trip to this bakery will take you less than 10 minutes there really is no place to sit and eat because of the size of the shop theres two small tables and maybe four chairs in the store id imagine most people get the pastries to go the selection is small so come earlier before its all gonethe time i went i selected the montblanc chestnut cake a kabocha pie and an apricotalmond pie i did so to sample their two variety of crusts a shortbread crust a puff pastry crust and their sponge suffice to say i was genuinely impressedif you could only use one word to describe the suzuyas pastries it would be this symphony they have a precision of flavors and textures that makes every note in your mouth sing thats right  this place is the ode to joy of pastry perfection it is a marriage of subtle spicingsweetening to enhance but not overwhelm the ingredients and excellent technical skillthe montblanc cake is sponge cake layered with pastry cream and chestnut puree the sponge cake flavor is just right  not too heavy handed on vanilla with all the pastry cream it retained a wonderful texture despite all that moisture chestnut purees tend to be overly sweet but they were perfect herekabocha pie  what a wonderful idea it was a japanese take on pumpkin pie and truly i was floored what perfection of puff pastry crust when it comes to pies its hard to find a pastry crust that is equally flaky even on the bottom well lo and behold suzuya has it down to a science the filling to pastry to ratio was just right as well finally the apricotalmond pie this was the husbands favorite pastry a crispy shortbread crust adorned with glazed apricots and moist almond filling so good and it was the special of the dayif i have one criticism of this place it is the prices the three items i purchased added up to 12ish for the price it would be nice to have a larger portion size for each of the desserts however that being said i have paid way more for dessert elsewhere and received significantly less enjoymentoverall for some amazing asian pastries this place is a 5 starred place in my books,1.0

this place is completely useless and a waste of time youll be better off eating at two peaks restaurant around the corner management is disorganized and lazy asked the male manager if we could offer drinks and food but he demanded that we order through our waitress waitress was obviously short staffed and over worked so we cant blame hercorporate really needs to get their stuff together and clean up this garbage excuse of a restaurant worst place we have been to in vegas food was equally terrible and pathetic had pizza which was fine but the cheese fries were so sad they dont even get it long enough so you get soft waffle fries what happened is it really that hard to take fries from the freezer and put it in the fryer for 4 minutes absolutely no quality control save your money and time and go anywhere literally anywhere else and you will be much happier,0.0

 buyer beware  first of all appointments mean nothing to this establishment  an oil change took 1 12 hours past my scheduled appointment time to be completed that is unacceptable  additionally what should have been a 1695 oil change turned in to a near 90 bill  without consent or approval additional work was performed on the vehicle  who does that  i get it if you see something that needs attention during the oil change process but you most certainly should notify the owner if additional charges are to be incurred  phil c was of no help  needless to say i contacted the powerstobe at big o in the hopes they can rectify this situation and prevent it from happening to others although i have a feeling this is common place here  they are very unprofessional and if i were you i would go elsewhere,0.0

my friends started a bike gang this past spring and while we might temporarily be restrained from roaming the streets a la sons of anarchy as it is 100 out we arent messing around  after i passed my initiation test i wanted to bike to spring training games too i realized i was missing some vital equipment a bike  wait a minute dirty harry was still sitting in my moms backyard since i graduated college  boomafter 3 years of sun and rain dirty harry who i never owned in pristine condition as it is was hanging on by a thread  i searched yelp for bike repair near my work and found old town beach cruisers  i called em up and they stayed open late on a friday eve for me to bring him by and asses the damage was he salvageableyou betcha 2 tire tubes basket wire bending a chain some oil and some new rubber handle grips later he was back in workingwickedfastorder rusted out fenders still included so vintage  this bike just does not know when to quit thats all that needed replacing after years of neglect  the nicer part was they didnt try to upsell me were very friendly and had everything done and ready to go by 10 am the next morning  they even called to let me know he was ready to rollim thinking about adding a better seat for the upcoming easy rider season and this place seemed to have a nice variety of well priced options to choose from so i will be back  they also do renting along with repairs and bike sales it looks to be a pretty nice set up for those visiting for spring training,1.0
i wandered in here after bar hopping the food was so amazing i decided that i had to come back when i was sober to make an actual judgement on if it was as delicious as i thought it wasit wasthis quickly became one of my favorite places to grab food on east carson i honestly think this taco place beats out the famed las palmas in oakland as well as reynas in the strip the tacos offered here may not be as authentic but the fusion of american and mexican in a nononsense way is kind of really amazing i think ive tried every taco offered and theyre all good however my favorites are the pork tacos and the chicken nachos the prices are extremely reasonable 3 a taco 5 for nachos and they take cards they also serve soda in glass bottles which is nice the place is open late on weekends making it the perfect drunk munchie sort of place,1.0
mac pro store thank you that is primarily why i go it is a must see when in vegas many high end stores louis vuitton zegna roberto cavalli etc they have intermix and other good stores i actually dont usually ever shop at the gap but for some reason the one at the forum i love i love the new wing they added on with the curvy escalater and a very nice ted baker and anthropologie over there lots of places to eat they have animatronic statues that do shows thru out the day the show down by cheesecake factory is the worst to get stuck in when its over blah overall its a nice shopping experience usually fairly crowded but what can you do its vegas ,1.0

fantastic little neighborhood thai restaurant were all about the pumpkin curry but sala thai has a lot more than one dish to offer the atmosphere its intimate with pretty much every square inch of wall space filled with kitschy artwork and memorabiliathe napkins neatly folded in birdlike form with a fork insertedthe presentation food is served in a manner consistent with a much more expensive restaurantthe menu pumpkin curry what more need be saidin all seriousness i love the food there is plenty of variety on the menu those in search of heat will find it those not can find safe refuge servers routinely ask for your heat preference on a scale of one to five with five being hottest keep in mind its an asian scale id suggest you go no higher than a three my preference even it you like your food spicy go higher at your own riskthey will ask you to pay in cash if possible we paid with a credit card on our most recent visit without problem or comment its just a small business understandably trying to avoid high credit card fees im fine with that if it helps keep their prices reasonable,1.0
this is by far the most obnoxious restaurant in montreal the stellar reviews here are mostly coming from outoftowners but for local montrealers buona notte is a bit of parody of itself and the whole stlaurent street scene see back in the late 1980s that area of st laurent between sherbrooke and pine was where all the most exclusive restos and clubs were filled to the hilt with the beautiful people aspiring actresses models and highend escorts places like business mediterraneo or disalvios most of them are longgone now and only buona notte still hangs on come formula 1 weekend you can only book a table at buona notte if you agree to the 5000 bottling fee  and its filled with f1 jetset types and the aforementioned models and escortstypes hoping to make a break the reek of desperation and posturing and posing is enough to make you lose your mealthis has a goodlooksandmoney entrance policy if you dont make the cut youre not getting in and even if you do have a reservation theyll place you at one of the worseoff tables in the back near the kitchen and no where near the front i came here once on a date years ago and i remember the waitresses in skimpy supertight dresses the wall of signed plates by the likes of nick rhodes of duran duranfame or jerry lewis as for the food it was awful bland and overpriced beyond belief when you come to buona notte youre not coming here for the food youre coming here to see and to be seen and that really irritates an avowed leftist and anarchist like myself,0.0

they really needs to hire more staff there completely over worked and the service is very slow it makes no sense why they would have just 23 people working on a busy sunday when clearly they need more people bakerbotts also will not sell pints of icecream because there too busy i literally have walked away without buying anything 4 times in a row because there was only 2 staff working and a 15 person line whoever owns this business is clearly all about the cash cow and not about the employees or patrons,0.0

i checked this coffee shop out in between work events and really liked it it seems like there arent that many coffee shops in arizona that roast their own beans this place does the environment was slightly upbeat and everyone was having a nice time it was still relaxed enough that you could do homework there though the coffee roaster is out in the open in display which is a nice touchi had a drip coffee it was their single origin guatemalan it tastes relatively freshly roasted and it was easy to drink black a mark of an  experienced coffee roaster you wont regret going here ,1.0

terrific restaurant family owned and run by various members of the family dad wears the chef hat and his kids take care of the tables we should all make an effort to support local business such as this but this place makes it a complete joy to do so full tummies and all on a recent visit to my home town we hosted my mothers birthday dinner here the food was so good we came back again before we left town you simply cant go wrong here the entire table loved their mains everything  from the lamb chops to the lasagna you do have to come with some patience but trust me when i say it pays off as the head chef dad plates up every dish himself and makes sure its noting short of perfect two of our guests ordered the lamb chops which came out cooked to perfection literally not undercooked or overcooked just cooked perfectly which by the way even the best of restaurants cant seem to nail the rest of us carb loving people ordered pasta and werent at all disappointed if my husbands comment doesnt put it in perspective i dont know what does i love you and your lasagna but this is the best lasagna ive ever had promptly followed by a kiss of course soften the blow but i dont mind because on our second trip back to this gem i order d the lasagna and he was right so good i need to up my lasagna game as for wine they have a good selection they carry genuine chianti from italy which is impressive to be a genuine chianti it has to the have the black rooster label and a serial number as this specific type of wine is governed by the italian government if you ever have a bottle of chianti without these two distinguishing marks its not legit i learnt all of this during a trip to italy last year and legit chianti is truly delicious bottomline this is the place to go for a traditional italian experience from the wine to the food reservations recommended,1.0

i have total respect for our first responders however when here is no need for guns to be drawn mesa pd seems to be bothered with issues that concern citizens in their neighborhood for example i have called five times within the last month and a half to have speed enforcement set up in our neighborhood there are cars constantly running stop signs vehicles speeding well in excess of 30 mph tailgating because some vehicles follow the speed limit and even some idiots driving in the wrong side of the road because they are on their phones question will it take some child in a bicycle or walking to school to get seriously hurt before we do something about this i have no vested interest in this since my kids are all adults and have moved out of our house however this is my neighborhood and have been here twenty one years and enjoy seeing kids play ball on the street ride their bikes to school couples walking their dogs daily but their safety is at risk because my concerns keep getting ignored thank you mesa pd,0.0

was in vegas and stumbled across this place when looking for a breakfast joint to go to near downtown on yelp there was such a variety of uncommon donut flavors nutella mud pie strawberry cheesecake homer simpson and the donuts were huge i asked the guy at the counter for a recommendation since there were so many choices and he said to try the french toast donut so i ordered and when it came out it was a huge donut with butter syrup and blueberry compote on the side i took the first bite with butter and dipped in syrup and i think the sky parted and  i heard angels singing the lightest french toast ever what a combo my girlfriend had the strawberry cheesecake and said it was amazing we will be back here the next time we are in vegas they only served this donut sat and sun from what the guy said so if you have a cheat meal and in vegas for a weekend this is the meal to have   its right down the street from the mob museum which was also a great place to visit after having a foodgasm,1.0

this is a must when visiting las vegas the entire cycle takes 30 minutes providing ample time to take a lot of photos this is probably my favorite attraction in vegas right now the high roller is the largest observation wheel in the world there are two different prices for day and night its a bit on the high side for an attraction that takes less than an hour of your day to complete but its worth the experience great for kids the wheel moves very slowly and there is many other people in the pod providing a safe environment for families the high roller is very close to a las vegas monorail stop,1.0
saturday afternoon we along with 6 friends purchased tickets for the 5520 pm zoom on sunday  we waited in line for 90 mins before we were allowed up to main platform where we found we would have at least another 90min2hr wait  when employees were asked what seemed to be the trouble and how much longer the delay would be no one couldwould give any explanation  we were finally 25 hours after our arrival told we could get a refund or reschedule for another time  reschedule  really  we wasted almost 3 hours standing in line why would we want to come back  the attitude of the staff makes one think this situation happens more often than not  slotzilla should if nothing else have a manager on site who is willing to inform their customers about delays and provide options more quickly although i doubt based on the response of their employees that will be the case,0.0

my house chinese cuisine just opened up around the corner from me ive been waiting patiently for them to open and am glad they finally did i have a weak spot for chinese take out and always welcome any new places to hopefully add to my rotation i left this morning to find a menu to my house on my doorstep i took this as a sign that i have to try this for dinner i had plenty of time to peruse the menu and decided on walnut shrimp green jade vegetables and crab rangoonsheres my verdict on each of my menu items i orderedwalnut shrimp  generous portion large shrimp  lightly  breaded and flavorful on their own complimented well by the walnuts and the white sauce i especially love that this wasnt drenched and drowning in sauce it allowed for the other flavors to shine throughgreen jade vegetables  as you may have guessed it this is an entree of green veggies green beans broccoli snap peas tossed in a white sauce again lightly sauced not soaking in sauce very flavorful for a side of veggies i was pleasantly surprisedcrab rangoons  aahhhh yes crab rangoons my guilty pleasure one of the deciding factors i consider whether i will return to a chinese  restaurant is how much i like their crab rangoons  these were top notch the wonton wrappers were fried perfectly light crunch good texture not hard or too chewy the cream cheese filling was seasoned filled with something magical that i thoroughly enjoyedneedless to say ill be back i wish this business all the luck if they keep up with the quality food they served up tonight they will do extremely well,1.0
i am a loyal canopi customer and the only reason for that the only reason is because they offer a variety of the specific oil products i use there was only 2 people before me in todays visit and still it was taking a while so their manager finally decides to work instead of flirting with the front desk girl but i wish he hadnt first of all he had a mug in his hand the whole time so we know hes in charge he was condescending and didnt know the answers to my questions and probably felt insecure for that he made me feel very awkward pretty much the whole he was there his name is chris i made sure to get his name to post this review,0.0
i am extremely satisfied with all the repairs and services that stuttgart southwest has performed on my 2005 porsche 911s over the last several years every time that i brought my car in for service jack the owner explain every aspect of the repairs that needed to be performed never tried to oversell and prices are considerably better than the dealer i had my car in for an oil change broken door handle and an intermittent off idle hesitation when rapidly pressing the throttle wide open they were unable to find any fault code in the computer that was causing the issue i installed a fabspeed  air intake system a while back that he thought that the intake could be causing the issue or mass airflow sensor  he suggested that i reinstall the factory intake as the aftermarket intake is great for the track but not good for daily driving and the 110 heat in phoenix  i reinstalled the factory air intake as suggested and car is running great againthey are the best  auto repair shop i ever used,1.0
it upsets me to leave this kind of review after my experience with this place because i try my best to give places and people the benefit of the doubt but i feel its necessary in case someone is considering this establishment please take your money elsewherei was given a gift certificate to get a massage by my boyfriend as i have severe arthritis and ive been wanting to take a day off work to fully relax and enjoy it when i first called to schedule my appointment the girl who answered sounded very short and as if she didnt want to be on the phone i told her i was calling to schedule an appointment and she put me down for 200 she never asked what i was looking to come in for or even explained anything this was my first time so i was unsure what the process was so it was partially my mistake for not asking what the process was and assumed i had to go in and tell them what i wantedi arrived 30 minutes early the greeting i received was awkward but i gave them my name i was told to have a seat but i was confused about doing so without filling out paperwork so i asked if i was to do so the girl was like oh yeah here you goas im filling out the paperwork i begin to realize that none of the questions seemed to pertain to the service i wanted at one point i asked her if i had the correct paperwork but then dismissed it because i saw questions asking about allergies so i figured maybe i was ocerthinking things i was utterly confused but did not want to seem like i was nitpicking so i handed over the paperwork and took a seati got called back by a nice woman and she said so is this your first time having a microdermabrasion i immediately let out a whoa and explained the miscommunication done by the front staff and told her i only wanted a massage and that i didnt even know what a microdermabrasion was and that i was scheduled for this without being asked what i wanted she looked upset but reassured me we would go to the front desk to get what i wanted i apologized to her because i felt terrible that she could have had a client for her services but instead didnt because of what happened so off to the front desk we go and i explained what the situation was they apologized and told me to come back at 4 pm for a hot stone massage that i wanted i was worried at this point and didnt even want to return but i did and wish i had just stayed at home insteadthe massage was okay and the woman who did it tried her best to make me feel relaxed and less tense from my arthritis i did not get the hot stone treatment instead i got charged for the hour long massage 89 and didnt even get the remaining amount left over from the 100 gift certificate to be honest i dont even want it after my experience that was supposed to be relaxing welcoming and stress free i left trying not to be that rude and upset customer even though i was trying to hold back frustration and tears and left with the intention of never coming back or recommending this place to anyone also always check the reviews on yelp instead of putting your trust into the reviews left on google completely misleading and after reading the reviews on here i can say the reviews on poor customer service is very spot on and accuratefirst impressions are everything and my experience here was enough to make me want to speak out and warn others,0.0

so much fun   went with two other couples and having heard the place was typically busy we went early600 and planned on putting our name in for a bay and then have dinner while we waited  this worked our perfectly   we ordered our food and very shortly after we were done eating we got the text that our bay was ready  note that each player needs to buy a 5 dollar players card which is good forever and is how the game play works  you load the card with money and swipe it in at your booth  make sure what line you are in when you enter so you dont end up standing in a line that you didnt need to be in they have kiosks for the cardsso for the food surprisingly it was really good  between the group we had a pretty good mix of plates on the table and everyone was really happy with their order  i had the basic cheeseburger but there was a cobb salad club sandwich and a few other dishes all the main dishes ran about 10 ish  the wait staff was on top of all our needs the entire time and let me tell you the place was packedgame time we were in a bay on the second floor and had a couch there are some bays that have tall tables but i think either would be comfortable for a group  they did have heaters that you control in your bay if neededwe did not  there are several games you can choose to play all varying around lightedcolored circles out in the range  you pay per hour and we played two hours  the price varies depending on the time of day for us it was 45 per hour for the bay  again outside the waitstaff was always in the ready and drinks deserts etc  were delivered quickly and with a smile  it was so pleasant good job to topgolf for training and customer service before i sign off one quick tip order the  injectable donut holes yep creme raspberry and chocolate fun and yum,1.0

i dont understand how this place has gotten such high reviews i went in expecting a 45 star restaurant but was very disappointed first off they brought us tea in a pot and this is the first time i get charged for tea at a sushi place the tea tasted like water and the soy sauce tasted like water we had a strong suspicion they water it down it was horrible and you really needed the taste of soy sauce to help you out because the rolls themselves tasted so bland one of the rolls we got i think it was the siren was basically a salad a salad without any dressing just a bunch of mint leaves and a cm sized shrimp the waiters although polite kept hovering around us and made us uncomfortable oh and they also charge for ginger and wasabi it doesnt even come with the specialty rolls order  they also brought out our sushi two orders at a time instead of all at once which i didnt like also each roll was the size of my hand please make your rolls smaller and bite size dont make it impossibleembarrassing for us to try to chewchoke on it in the end for three people  our bill came out to 100 pretty outrageous for less than mediocre sushii definitely disappointed my guests by bringing them here based on reviews yelp did not come through this time unfortunately,0.0

one would typically think that going through a drivethrough may somewhat insinuate someone might be eating in the car hub ordered a chicken sandwich plain only cheese myself 3 small sides corn mashed potatoes and mac and cheese we are told this will be 17 dollars wow so this starts a car fight of how this can possibly be so so when we get the window its actually 13 okay thats better as we pull off to head to our event for the evening we open the bag to find there is no fork no napkins and  his sandwich is the absolute farthest thing from plain sauce ran off the wrapper into his hand crap if only wed had a napkinif you come here check your order well and if planning non inside dining bring your own silverware and napkins or swear and run across to the frys deli across the street for the items,0.0

stay away i did my research on the company and did see a couple negative reviews but thought they might be a one off experience or hard to please customers  the price was great and about 100 less than the other companies  you get what you pay for  only one bellhop showed up for the job  the company called me multiple times and said that they were sending someone else while the one guy was moving everything out of my building eventually another bellhop did show upfor about 45 minutes rushed and stressed me out even more and when i got the bill i saw they charged me for him being there for two hoursthe one bellhop that was there from the beginning had one more run to make  he had dragged my mattress out in the hall way of my apartment building and said he would be right back when the mover didnt come back after an hour i went to look for him  the mover and the truck driver were no where in sight  my furniture was sitting out on a very busy road with the truck door open  the one bellhop that showed up just up and left my mother and i had to drag my mattress back inside of my apartment and i had to sit outside to make sure no one was stealing literally all of my belongings during the lull ofan hourhour and a halfof not knowing where the truck driver was and realizing that the mover just bailed an ambulance showed up at my apartment building and the truck was blocking the cop and paramedics from the easiest access to the patient eventually about two hours later the company sent two more bellhops out and they were able to finally finish the job  it took the company 10 hours to move out of a 600 sq ft studio the truck was loaded terribly and it looked like the boxes marked fragile were purposely thrown aroundthey were dented and some of the belongings inside were broken the company charged me for 10 hours of bellhops and 10 hours of moving  at first they told me they would take off the price of the trucki refuse to pay for 10 hours of moving when it should have taken three hours at most  it was not my fault that the company has unreliable employees  after multiple phone calls and added stress by bill was discounted and ended up paying way too much for this nightmare of a move  honestly just look through the reviewsevery other review shows an issue or a bell hop not showing up  please learn from my experience and hire a different moving company  it was not worth saving 100 for all the stress and headache i went through,0.0

i ended up being very disappointed by this company  i had heard good things about them and liked the sale representative mike when he came out to my house  he spent more than an hour measuring and talking to me about options which i was very interested in  i was told a quote would come in about a week  when nothing came i followed up with mike who referred me to ester  ester told me the quote was going to someones desk for review and i would have it in a few days  after another couple week i called again asking if they had anything for me  i was told one of the employees had some personal issues they were sorry and would get the quote right over to me  after another week and a half  i called the sales person mike  i told him normally i would be long gone but i really liked some of the things he said  i told him if they were not interest in my job to just let me know and i would stop bugging them  mike told me that was not the case at all and that he was going to go speak with ester and would make sure they got the quote right over to me  that was over a week and a half ago and still nothing  after 6weeks i think it is time to give up on these guys  if it is this hard to get a quote to someone who is very interested in working with them i fear what the actual job would have gone like,0.0
visiting toronto from la and was told this was the place to try im sorry but the food was horrible i tried a few plates and every single one was actually pretty gross the worst plate was the grilled octopus chewy beyond any octopus i have ever had i actually couldnt bring myself to even finish it the scene was more a drunk businessmen man vibe then anything and the sangria they sell walking around the tables tastes like some crappy kids juice box im a foodie and if youre looking for a food experience take a pass on this place the food is horrible disappointed on my birthday with a gross meal,0.0

if i could give a negative number i would this salon is a den of unprofessional backbiting immature subpar vipers taylor originally did my extensions which were a hot mess with tape sticking out all over extensions all the way up to my crown so not enough natural hair covered them and the hair used was cheap and not of good quality when i came in for extensions taylor used a razor and butchered my natural hair without asking permission  so taking the crappy extensions out wasnt even an option taylor seriously has no clue how to cut hair or do extenions yet tells her first time clients her sob story way tmi fishing for extra tips super professional huh my hair was so bad i came back within two days and thank god i found marisa who saved my hair and is an awesome stylist id give marisa 10 stars and will follow her to any salon she goes to im a client for life she is professional   polite knows all aspects of color cut and extensions and is simply a pleasure to spend time with i look forward to our time together each month and so completely trust her with my hair that i say do what you think will look good and every time i leave im so extremely happy with my hair she is that awesome for 14 months ive put up with rude inappropriate nasty comments from taylor and the owner crystal  which speaks volumes of their petty immature high school mean girl mindset but marisa is so awesome its worth it to keep going back but this week taylor crossed the line and had the nerve to talk crap about me to her client in front of my face first of all i never had a client relationship with taylor she simply answered the phone so booked the appointment with herself and then totally fd up my hair  second how is ever ok to talk sht about any client but especially in front of them  i cant wait for marisa to finally leave and go where she isnt bullied and treated like crap but ill put up with the rude and disrespectful behavior because i wont go to anyone else even if shes at this crappy little salon,0.0
i checked this place out recently and thought the facilities were decent  not as new as some other places around town but definitely up there  however at the end of my tour the pushy salesman refused to let me try a work out  i guess he expected me to sign my life away without even working out there once  not gonna happenbased on my experience and after reading some other comments on yelp about the sales tactics i would definitely avoid this place there are plenty of other great gyms in the area,0.0

went in got a drink 5 cover excited about being there asked bartender if we could smoke cigar she said yes paid for our drinks was asked by the door nazi to put out cigar really too bad one we asked to have a cigar two they allow cigar and cigarette smoking inside its unfortunate that tourists come to a locals bar and then want to complain about smoking in an establishment where it is legal they are more than welcome to stay in california we  had high hopes of the lounge and the music  they lost our business forever as a local that supports locally owned businesses i wont be supporting this one too bad bar rescue couldnt give some of the employees good sense also be known there was another person smoking a cigar inside he just happened to be over by the band area i never saw him approached to get rid of his if i was smoking a cheap cigar i could see they do stink but this was a montecristo epic,0.0

we have grown to appreciate patrick riley they offer top notch service at our previous home we used another vendor and they let us down they fixed the ac under warranty every 23 months but it was really poorly installed and then one weekend the company refused to call back or come out i quickly found patrick riley they came out  revamped the entire system got it up and running and replaced some key parts that were missing in the electrical and charged us only 20000 for the parts  we signed a service contract and never used it their fix was the best and it never broke after they fixed it  prior to selling the home they provided us with a free inspection and shared the information with the realtors it was super service then at the new home we were delighted to find we could move our contract over we received excellent support as we moved in and repaired our existing ac unit  such great support we turned to them to buy a new unit received a member discount and had it installed in 4 hours it was that simple  they have never been late to an appointment always call in the morning and have been very professional  the only time we were not happy was when they asked if we wanted someone from the plumbing company to do an inspection and we were not satisfied with that person or their professionalism  i prefer the ac and will stick with that for now not even worth taking off a star,1.0

this lovely and relatively new hotel  resort in las vegas is first rate vinny and i stayed there this summer during a quick jaunt to vegas and really enjoyed the hotel and all of its amenities when we first checked in we didnt expect wed have a good experience because right off the bat we had to wait in a 45minute line to check in and then the hotel screwed up and didnt have our reservation correct fortunately the folks at the cosmopolitan more than made up for it by giving us an updated room free of charge and i must say the room was amazing it was a large 1 bedroom suite w a balcony overlooking the bellagio hotel and fountain yes the very one where they do the daily fountain and light show what a view i tell ya plus the room had a large sunken tub and walkin shower a large living room seating area and hightech work space yep sadly i had to do a little work on the trip even though we were mostly there for vacation but the work space turned out to be a godsend for me other great features of the cosmopolitan include their casino its modern looking and packed with lots of high rollers and beautiful people their abundance of restaurants and shops and their large pool recreation area which features a couple of outdoor bars and plenty of lounge chairs for relaxing note that one of my favorite things about the cosmopolitan believe it or  not is their pizza restaurant check out my review of the pizzeria  the cosmopolitan some of the best pizza ive ever had,1.0

epic has become one of the companies i depend on to keep my business running smoothlyive been using epic for about 2 years after they were referred to me by the ac company ive used for 15 years   epic has never disappointed me   they handle repairs quickly efficiently and cost effectively  i just had them do a job repairing a leak in a cast iron kitchen drain line in an older home   they told me that they might need to jackhammer out some of the concrete floor to get to expose enough of the pipe to do the repair because the leak was right above the floor  they told me it would be 850 minimum   they called me the next day with the job complete and news that they had been able to make the repair without jackhammering so the total cost was only going to be 600  considering how hard working with cast iron can be thats really reasonable epic plumbing does quality work at reasonable prices   they are available 24hrs for emergency calls but they dont do routine repairs outside of normal business hours which is understandable  if you need them though they will show up and theyll do a good job for you  i cant recommend epic highly enough,0.0

i was looking for a rent a motorcycle to do some touring with the last of my vacation days as the weather was turning cold in chicagoi had 4 criteria for the rental company1 i wanted an experienced rental and tour company with a good reputation  i have heard horror stories about bad rentals online particularly in az2 i wanted some place with interesting geological features  another downside of motorcycling in chicago is straight flat roads  i wanted something interesting to ride on3 a place that rented exotic bikes ie something other than harleys  nothing against harleys i just wanted to try something different4 something in the 100 or lessday range  im an offseason tourist because im looking for a bargain mc tours met all of these very easily  they were well reviewed by their past customers on an admittedly biased guestbook and it was clear to me that they knew what was up with their very professional and knowledgeable communications  they were answering my lists of questions i hadnt even asked yet  obviously arizonas red rocks area along with the grand canyon and tucson valley make for gorgeous sight seeing so i knew i was going to have some great destinations but monica and gabor at mc tours showed me some great roads to travel on that were as much fun as the destination  the bikes at mc tours were just what i was looking for  i ended up getting a bmw r1200gs for 6 days but had other more touring minded options as well as some cruisers  triumphs bmws kawasakis lots of options  the bikes were immaculate and gabor gave me a great rundown on what to expect from the bike and how to operate it  he had the kind of expertise that only comes from having ridden the bike and knowing what it will do  he wasnt just regurgitating the manual to me  the bikes came with a disc lock and gigantic saddlebags for no extra charge and had gps and several other options available  i personally like the old fashioned paper maps and wasnt doing any offroading so i skipped the gps  they had a great mileage saver option available to me since it was offseason and even though i went over the miles per day allowance of the cheaper option the overages still came out to be less than the more expensive unlimited mileage packages  i certainly wasnt stressing about my mileage or watching the odometer very closely  i managed to pack in 1200 miles with just about 5 full days of riding and still managed to save 300 over the other options,1.0

5 stars cause its a nice new sportswear store on the north shore  as if the north shore needed another sports apparel store right  this is kind of like the steelers sidelines store you can find in heinz field the majestic clubhouse store in pnc park or like the pittsburgh fan store on federal st  however this store has more options  they have apparel home decor and gifts for not only the steelers and pirates but also the penguins panthers dukes nittany lions grays crawfords and even the mountaineers of nearby wv  if youre a fan of any of those teams then theres something here for you  in my opinion everything in these stores are well overpriced  you can find 9 different locations in pa and over 60 stores in 9 states  visit rallyhousecom for their entire collection of items,1.0

i absolutely love this gym and could not explain in words the gratitude i have for this place and the staff the trainers are extremely knowledgeable very encouraging and very professional i would have to say one of my favorite things about mike and matt is that they push you to go beyond your comfort zone with a positive and encouraging approach and even better they keep you accountable for your success they give you all the tools you need to accomplish your goals and remind you that if you trust the process and be accountable for what you do outside of the gym and at home in the kitchen you will absolutely get your results the trainers are so professional and very informative the training classes are amazing theyre challenging motivating and you learn so much from each class theyre consistently helping you  improve your form etc on specific workouts so you learn and incorporating new things to maximize your workouts and progress with your fitness  i joined revolution training to do the 6 week challenge and completed my challenge 2 weeks ago from the beginning of the 6 week challenge to now ive lost 7 body fat and 20lbs total the results i have had personally have exceeded my expectations i also would like to point out that revolution training is home to people in all different walks of fitness in our group there were  people who were already in shape and wanted to get in even better shape people who had a background in fitnesssports but were out of shape and had some weight to lose and others whove never worked out before and were ready to make a change it was so amazing seeing everyone making progress and all of us feeling and seeing the change in our bodies if you are looking for a change in your health i highly recommend working with the revolution training team talk with them about what your goals are and they will help you get there these guys are extremely professional personable and knowledgeable i could not have picked a better gym,1.0

i came to the glendale location with my family for fathers day and was completely disgusted there was a spill on the floor within minutes of us being seated we saw three serversemployees attend to the spill they used their bare hands to wipe the floor and pick up ice have their bare hands all over your the dirty mop bucket and mop head this would not have been an issue if any of them would have went to wash their hands before continuing to serve drinks and food one of these employees was even grabbing the cups by rim with her dirty hands and serving drinks to customers in them i did bring this to the managers attention who seemed disinterested and blew me off by say dont worry and i got it right now as he turned away and didnt let me finish what i was saying he then said to the employees everyone wash your hand which no one did needless to say i will not be returning or recommending this establishment to anyone i will make the extra 20 min drive to angry crab where the staff is friendly and sanitary and the food is better,0.0

i heard canoe was one of the best restaurants in canada so i just had to try it  in addition canoe has a focus on regional cuisine which draws me in like a moth to a flame  fortunately i was already in toronto   after actually dining there i do hope that canadian food catches on in atlanta  we already have a restaurant called canoe so theyll have to call it rowboat  hey a girl can dreamalmost every seat in the house is great  from the 54th floor of the td bank tower building you can see across the city  what a sleek cosmopolitan feel  this is toronto from its best angle  inside the restaurant the decor is sophisticated and simple with a warm modern disposition  canoe has a focused menu  plenty of regional or at least national cheeses seafood interesting red meats and seasonal veggies  here the canadian bent seems to make perfect sense and detracts from nothing  the platings are just lovely  one in our group had an octopus dish that was right out of michel bras playbook  i enjoyed a rather simple fish that was perfectly delicious though i do regret not splurging for the tasting menu  seriously when the chef has this much artistry and clarity its worth it  canoes food was approachable even by those in our group with less of a fine dining focus which speaks again to the talent and vision of the chef anthony walshservice was attentive and well executed but most of all the staff had a genuine attitude of pride towards the food they served  it was easy to tell from their descriptions and mannerisms that they thought the food was amazing and im sure that contributed to my judgementyes the food is expensive  im sure the rent and ingredients are too  at some point when youre evaluating fine dining its art  ill always remember this dinner and hope to return for the tasting menuso is canoe the best restaurant in canada  it offers my favorite straight culinary experience in toronto with opus being my actual favorite restaurant  restaurants with great views have a tendency to offer mediocure food and become tourist traps but this is the opposite  i highly recommend canoe to both locals and tourists,1.0

atmospherewalking in there were pastries and coffee at the front and seats in the back for a sit down meal we got there quite late circa 245 pm and found that there was still a 45 minute wait this cozy little spot is notorious for a wait but it was well worth it food the only disappointing thing was how much had sold out by then all the cold sandwiches i wanted to try were out alas i took a deep breath and decided upon having a chicken kale caesar salad boy was it tasty and that bread so delish next time im in id like to make it earlier to try one of the sandwiches and if you dont have the luxury of time do yourself a solid and get a croissant andor a few pastries for the roadoverallcoming back the next time im in town such a cute spot and im determined to get a sandwich next time around,1.0
looked over many reviews and saw this restaurant had many good reviews  i wanted to have a special dinner for my wife and i to celebrate our 20th anniversary and took a chance on this place  worked out better than i hoped  great atmosphere and fantastic service  our waiter vince was the best i have ever encountered  he was very good at advising us on the menu and he was right on the mark  my steak was a filet on the bone and was perfect  the sauces they give you are both fantastic and the balsamic butter on the steak alone would have made it the best steak i have had in along time  my wife had the bolognese sauce and loved it  we bought a bottle of wine as it is a better deal than by the glassthe bottom line if you are looking to splurge on a great dinner in vegas i would go to stacks every time by the way you cant go wrong with a place that serves adult tater tots,1.0
bedbugs and roaches at the 2744 hampshire rd building we know that we absolutely did not bring them in no parking fire escape is a nightmare be very careful as one of the steps collapsed when we were moving in office staff is difficult to deal with maintenance staff are prompt and helpful when they offered to extend our lease another year they raised the rent price 15 fair enough but when we turned them down they advertised our original rental price to new tenants building is showing its age fuses in the kitchen blew regularly do not recommend,0.0

save yourself the terrible service overpriced food and awful experience and go somewhere else definitely not worth it especially if there is a wait after waiting nearly an hour to get our food after we placed our order our food came out i would have been willing to give this place 2 or 3 stars if the food was at least half decent but it wasnt our burgers were extremely dry the chicken satay wraps were tasteless and cold and my sisters fries were dry and stale i was hoping that after the long wait at least our food would be good but it seemed like it had just been sitting out forever frozen hot chocolate my best advice would be to skip their frozen hot chocolate and instead go to godiva and get their frozen dark chocolate decadence shake it tastes better and costs less than half the price we got the frozen hot chocolate to go because we wanted to get out of the place the frozen hot chocolate is good but definitely not worth 11 each of us took a few sips and that was all we needed before throwing it away and trust me it was not because we were full this was the closest i have ever come to walking out of a restaurant our server robert or something like that was probably one of the worst servers i have ever had my entire family works or has worked in the restaurantservice industry so we usually give servers the benefit of the doubt but this guy was unacceptable even to our standards he gave us a bunch of attitude and was not attentive at all at one point it was taking so long for our food to come out that my mom asked him to cancel our order but he told us oh but its right there i can see it i had a direct view of the kitchen and there was nothing on the counter but we decided to be nice and say ok fast forward 15 minutes later still no food he intentionally avoided our table during that entire time and was not apologetic at all i think he may have said sorry once but it was the least genuine and most condescending sorry i have ever heard to end on a happy note the decor is really cute reminds me of an old school ice cream shop,0.0

the best thing about this place is its location inside the enclosed mall  while eating my crappy lunch  ill get to that in a moment  i was sitting in their cafe  the ceiling of the mall has a sky motif suddenly i heard thunder the sky turned a bit dark remember this is inside the mall and it started to rain drops of water fell from the ceiling into a pool below  it truly simulated a spring showercool  but i came for the food  and that was awfuli ordered beef with broccoli  to quote clara peller  remember her  wheres the beef  i got overpriced broccoli with a side of tasteless overcooked noodlesunfortunately some restauranteurs in touristy areas dont care about client retention since their customerbase is transient i hope reviews like this spark the owners to upgrade their standards  i for one wont be back,0.0

first time and never again i take partial responsibility for my crappy experience i should have looked up the reviews on this nail salon before walking in and once i was in the chair i should have trusted my gut and ran instead of worrying about being rude this nail salon is inside great lakes mall near the sears store  the salon was fairly busy and looked popular  i went in for a simple gel french manicure which i have had multiple times at other salons i was quoted 35 for this service before agreeing to it picked out my pink nude base and took the first available technician  the first bad sign i should not have ignored was the dust there was nail powder and dust coating the floor tables chairs tools everything and it was even on my black pants and i had been in the salon for less than 5 minutes i had two simple and polite requests before the manicure started one  i did not want my nails to be over filed and two  i did not want the white part of the french design to be thick the part where i should have walked out is when i noticed the nail files and buffing blocks had been used previously on other clients its gross other peoples nail dust and germs are all in the files as they grind down your nails  i should have said something i should have requested new tools i was embarrassed i am not good at being confrontational or speaking up and looking rude but also in a professional salon i shouldnt have to ask them to use clean tools so i sat there skeeved out over it when i was told i could wash my hands i scrubbed them down good the nail technician hardly talked to me which made it awkward he kept talking to the other people working in the salon in another language i think the only small talk we made was that he told me to take biotin for my thin nails the part that really made me mad was that he ignored my request about the white tips not being thick i politely asked him to make them thinner and he tried to talk me out of it that is fine and all i heard his point but then i requested it my way anyways because i am the one paying and it is my fingers i have to look at he then proceeded to roll his eyes at me and fix it in a very rushed manner because apparently i was taking up too much of his precious time when he was done he didnt even ask me if i liked the way he had fixed it he looked annoyed as i inspected my hand to make sure i liked it before i stuck my hand under the curing lamp that is where his tip went down a bit i am a paying customer a polite one at that who is not sitting down for the cheapest gel manicure aroundsorry not sorry oh and my nails were totally being over filed the whole time i had medium length nails and left with nicely shaped stubs i had to kind of pull my hand away while he was filing to make him stop it very aggravatingthey put this disgusting lotion on you afterwards with a hand massage i am still trying to clean the disgusting dried up lotion out of my diamond ring not even a warning he was going to do it so i could have taken to ring offthe icing on the cake was when i noticed a bottle of windex next to the stations i have a suspicion that is what they are cleaning the tools with i couldnt help but feel very very skeevy looking at that bottle lets just say it obviously wasnt there to clean the manicure tables because the place was a mess again no proof just a suspicion of my own i paid and left as soon as i could i have no intentions of ever returning nor will i ever recommend them to anyone oh and in case you were wondering my 35 french manicure suddenly cost more after the service the tip has to be in cash and they expect a full tip the manicure i got is not worth what i paid it is awful to leave a nail salon thinking i cant wait to get to a sink so i can scrub my hands arms and bath them in purelli know this is long but i hope this review helps you,0.0

my favorite artisan ice cream place i love all their seasonal ice creams and regular ones they just have such interesting combinations but my favorite is not ice cream its their riesling pear sorbet it is so good its sweet with just a bit of tartness even though the prices here can be on the high side its definitely worth the price the ambiance is very causal and chill its in the middle of downtown chagrin falls so its one of my favorite spots for a date,1.0

this place is home away from sweet home chicago seriously if you didnt go outside and feel the desert heat you would think you were in a typical chicago style fast food jointive had most everything here except the pizza and i can tell you its all the real deal hot dogs beef italian sausage polish and gyros its all just as good as youd get back in chi townmy favorite meal here is the gyros sandwich and im a real stickler on this there are several places to get gyros here in the valley but if you want the real deal chicago style gyros this place has it and does it right they use real shaved off the spit gyro meat on a lightly grilled pita with onions tomato and tzatziki sauce and thats it no lettuce olives feta cheese weird herbs or funky dressings like some other places serve it at last ive found a decent gyro in vegasalso nice people working there good service chicago sports on the tvs and plenty of pictures and memorabilia on the walls to make you homesicki only wish they were closer to my house,1.0
do not stay here and expect your things to be safe  we had our ipad stolen out of the room safe and they will not do anything about it  the worst customer service i have ever dealt with  we were treated like liars  i would expect this from a 2 star hotel but not the bellagio  update  contacted customer service after lori p of the bellagio told me to and yet again a horrible experience  they are refusing to do anything about our stolen ipad that was stolen on their property by their own staff  really bellagioyou are a joke of a company when you dont even stand behind your employees that you hirednot me  i lost more money in your casino than the cost of an ipad but its the principle of the matter  you took my ipad from the room safe that you provided as a safe place for my belongings and i want it back  the saddest part of this whole ordeal is that no one has even offered an apology  they just keep passing the problem to someone else  i cant tell you how much time i have wasted on the phone talking to these inconsiderate people  as a doctor i dont have a lot of free time to spend on hold waiting for the next person and the next person  i guess they are too busy counting the billions of dollars they made last year to deal with my petty issue,0.0
the chrome toaster was one of the food trucks at the beer me brew fest  when i saw the silverpainted old school bus i knew i had to try this one the menu is written on the glass of the bus door  i saw philly and knew this was my order for the day  added an order of fries with thisas i said with my tip both the sandwich and the fries were amazing  first the fries  these are not ordinary french fries  these are roasted fingerling potatoes cut up in spears or the smaller ones left whole and seasoned with herbs and other seasonings  best fries i have ever tastedthe philly was served on a kaiser roll and was stuffed  the roll itself tasted like it was homemade  it was light and had more of the texture of a croissant  the meat was sliced beef  caramelized onions mushrooms and cheese were mixed in with the meat and watercress added on top   absolutely amazingits funny that i have been searching for a long time for the best philly cheesesteaks in charlotte and now my two favorites come from food trucks  in fact the chrome toaster just took over the 2 spot in my favorite food trucks list in charlotte  dont let the bus fool you this is for real,1.0
i cannot believe some of the posts regarding south hills movers must be disgruntled former employees or those looking for something for nothing we have used shm on 3 separate occasions for long range moves and have been totally satisfied with both the movers and the administration staff we have had no surprises and they have always delivered on commitments exactly as promised if we had questions they responded immediately if we suggested any changes or modifications they could not have been any more supportive our last move from pittsburgh to florida back in may included moving 280 boxes and 16000 plus pounds of household goods all was professionally packed by shm and we had only two glass related items broken my wife broke one and i broke the other we had 4 folks pack and 3 involved in the delivery to our new home they arrived 5 minutes early and worked their butts off the entire time they were here i had used other moving companies earlier in my career i can honestly say that south hills movers were the best we have ever dealt with and no one is paying me to say this i would be happy to answer any questions any potential customer may have  paul,1.0

this is an updated reviewi dont know what the change is from our previous purchase something has changed at this dealerwe are onto our second cadillac and were about to purchase our thirda car off the lot only upgrade was to be tinted windows we put 10 k down on a 2018 atsa car that was either sold or really didnt exist but either way was supposed to be at the dealership within days of the deal and paymentthe first excuse was the weather stuck on a rail car in ohio snowbound then as days past and turned into a week or so it was a shortage of rail cars and it hadnt movedthe only contact was the contact i made they were not proactive and in no way did they make an effort to resolve the issue my frustration grew and i expressed that to both the salesman and the gsmthe last excuse was cadillac was having delivery issues finally i called one last time to speak to the gsm yet again he had no idea who i was i had to remind him and about the situation he said he would have an update in 4872 hours not acceptable  it was not a special order then we got a letter in the mail thanking us for our purchase asking how we were enjoying the car and to please refer people really do you have a clue about customer servicethe salesman bruce kline and the gsm scott trumbley were pretty much useless needless to say i canceled the purchase and requested my down payment be returned immediately cadillac is getting a letter the cadillac we own will be our last we will not be using findlay for servicing of the current car,0.0

i really like this place from the chilled adult beverage menu to the dessert menu justin beckett has put together an impressive and challenging array of culinary delights for your dining pleasure weve only been here a few times but bt is fast becoming a favorite hot tip get the deviled egg of the day yesterday was the eggplant parmesan complete with a tiny but tasty parmesan chip about the size of a dime these things are little single bites of tastebuds joy we also had the roasted beet appetizer this dish was more than enough for the three of us dining the entres for the evening were the roasted chicken delicious ribs moist tender  tasty and the flattop seared cheese burger pretty good but ill try something else next time the drink menu offers some really tasty concoctions too if you like a sazerac try the legend city if youre a native youll appreciate the nod to the amusement park bring a ladmo bag,1.0

legit and authentic i think ive tried them all the pasties and there were only 2 i didnt care for my go to traditional pasty is the bangers and mash and when i feel like a little spice in my life i go with the carne adovada if you really want to mix it up try the chicken greek or the salmontheir soups are amazing it took me awhile before i ever ordered soup at this place and now i never dont get at least a cup even when its 110 degrees outside the red pepperchicken is where i started but now i cant get away from the cream of leak i wasnt even sure what leaks were before i tried it and now i cant get enough it has a certain addictive qualityi also like the added apps and sides love the bar service is good but has a strong hipster presence if you can handle tattoos and piercings along with great food and a nice beer selection this is must to check out,1.0

very friendly quick n efficient clean n family friendlyi need to update my earlier review be very careful when going here as far as your insurance we now have over 1000 in medical bills because the urgent cares contracts were not signed at the time of the service when calling their billing dept was advised that the receptionists dont have that information so be very careful before going to these clinics still trying to see what can be done,0.0
omg i can not get enough of this place everytime i come to vegas i must visit this taco place they have the absolute best tacos bowls and burritos ever i have been to many taco place but this one is the best the have amazing flavoring and seasoned to perfection the ladies are so great and very friendly the owners are sisters and have a few other locations theyre restaurant is a cute little spot with an upstairs its a very cut setting its a must try if your in vegas you wont regret it,1.0
i give this a rating of zero for the head doctor in charge dr nichols and this is the only reason for the low rating  the ladies at the front desk and the nurses are caring and wonderful and i received good care in previous years with msvierra but she is no longer at this practice  i also received 5 star dietary care with the dietician onsite mr valenzuela and he is still there  if you need help with weight loss this is the place  the new assistant whitmore is very nice but he is working under dr nichols and i have found the level of care to be slipping  i was in alot of discomfort and it took me more than 3 weeks of trying over the counter meds to get antibiotics for a serious infection  the other reason i will not be going back there is lack of patience and bedside manner by dr nichols  when you are already not feeling well the last thing you need is to deal with a doctor who is impatient with a very accusatory bedside manner and also  making incorrect assumptions about you  i really think he may be ready for retirement and i can no longer recommend this practice only because of him    it is true what the previous reviewer said about how the receptionists are quick to point out you need to go back for another appointment to talk to the doctor even soon after you just had a visit  it seems some follow up to the previous problem would not be unreasonable for a call back to answer questions  this only happened once over the course of over 3 years of going there i would 99 of the time have to go back for another visit to talk about a related question so i do back up the previous reviewer on yelp,0.0
good prices until the owner decided not to  take ownership of his staff ruining 2 of my shirts i was told something to the effect of there is no way we couldve put those stains on your shirts i guess its an impossibility for dry cleaner to ruin shirts his compromise was offering me a 20 credit which wouldve covered 20 of the value of the shirts lost i wont continue to play russian roulette with my nice clothing id advise you to do the same the humorous part of the whole thing is i probably spent over 50 per month on dry cleaning a savvy business person wouldve pulled my account realized the value of a good customer and done the right thing,0.0

love this place favorite restaurant in madison i dont live there anymore but when i returned for a visit this is the first place i went they take reservations on open table and i suggest making one especially on nights when there are shows at the overture center because they get really busyi always start with a glass of prosecco or wine and an order of the bacon wrapped dates they have a large selection of wines and the dates are amazing ive tried almost all the pizzas and pastas and none of them have disappointed my favorite pasta is the tagliatelle i pretty much get that every time now and dont try anything new  when you find something that works why change i also have to give this place 5 stars for service one time when i ordered the tagliatelle it was mostly sauce there wasnt a lot of pasta by the time i finished eating the pasta i was left with a plate of meat sauce i pointed this out to the waiter and asked if i could just have more pasta to mix in with the sauce instead the chef made me a brand new dish a little smaller than the usual because i requested it be a small portion and i got to take lots of leftovers home anytime ive had an issue theyve always addressed it quickly and with a smile,0.0

yup fivestars from the moment i walk inside i feel happy my goto drink is the taro slush its lightly sweet and the most beautiful shade of purple its blended to creamy perfection and topped with fresh taro i go boba free because i am simply not a fan im always greeted warmly by the staff who are like a machine they have waves of busy times but all the time so dont let the long line intimidate you they move fast and know what they are doingmy latest trip i was tempted to order an actual tea but wasnt sure what i wanted the girl at the register was super nice and took her time with me while i pushed myself out of my taro slush comfort zone i ordered the peach iced tea and added the sea salt cream it sounded good at the time and it was a pretty tasty combo i probably wouldnt order my personalized creation again but i was a big fan of the tea itself the sea salt cream is heaveni wish the menu was a bit more descriptive but thats because i get ordering anxiety sometimes you should see me at a drivethru anytime i have a question the staff at brew tea bar will make sure im taken care of,1.0

this turned out to be one of the only places open for breakfast when we were here at the airport as we did search for a better option but turned out almost nothing we we stood to order and a worker stayed there scrubbing the fryer and we waited and waited then a cook came out sipping coffee and said someone will be with us shortly after a few minutes more people were pileling up in line and the person scrubbing the fryer decided on taking orders  we ordered the breakfast egg muffin sandwiches with the hashbrowns and they were tossed to us from a drawer below the counter almost warm in foil and we were told they would make some hashbrowns soon  i did see hot dogs spinning be thought they might be from last night but as it turned out i fear the breakfast sandwich might have been older  i took a bite and even after adding ketchup salt and pepper this was not edible  the muffin was uncooked without nooks or crannies and sort of had a solid cardboard taste yuk i dont have a clue on how to make an inedible egg the way they did it because it was far worst than any frozen or microwaved egg  not only was it unfit for human consumption i also would never feed my dog something this nasty  the egg egg was thick and solid and might have been mixed with something unknown or was maybe just so old i just dont know  or a combination of both  i couldnt sample more to figure it out  the cheese not cheese was thick orange something between wax  paste  rubber and slime so these sandwiches went in the trash fastthe hashbrowns were edible they turned out to be chopped up french fries ate a few forks full i know this isnt the ritz but this was the pitsas far as i am concerned they stole 15 from us ,0.0

do not order delivery from this placeunless you want to enjoy a cold pizza an hour late this has happened twice now in the past month i will admit that the pizza is actually good but when you have to wait two hours when the stated max time is an hour and you must reheat it once it finally arrives it just isnt as tasty we live eight minutes from the location and called after waiting an hour and a half and the response was its on the way  no reason as to why its been so long and then we continued to wait for 30 more minutes we also really enjoyed having ranch dressing with our greek salads there are plenty of other pizza places and even if this pizza was actually the best which its not it is  worth the time or getting the wrong order,0.0
wish i could give negative stars henderson properties was the worst for over 3 years we rented from a property they managed if not for my having the owners contact info not sure if anything would have ever been repaired or attended to i could list so many things i should have known from day one when we pulled up to move in and the carpets stillhad dog feces on it from the previous tenant we were promised the house would be cleaned and it never was it took me getting the owner involved to just get the carpets cleaned fast forward to move out they would not do a personal walk thru after we did a clean up for move out so knowing the history i took photos when i receive my security deposit they deducted for missing window screens i sent them pics showing they were there when we left even appealed the decision they still ended up keeping 196 for screens someone must have stolen when we left and 95 for an outlet box on the front porch that was never there they also charged 20 to remove a small no solicitation sticker on the screen door that is still on it i have friends there still,0.0

i have lived in the valley for over a year and with so many pho places its hard to finally pick one and try it  i have been to only one other pho restaurant here and it was amazing  but its 40 minutes away  i was feeling pretty ill one night hangover i admit it and consulted yelp on a pho restaurant that was open at 930 pm  it led me to this restaurant in a shopping center  i called them and asked if it was too late to place an order  the lady on the other end of the line was more than happy to take my order regardless of the late time  in a hurry i went to go pick up my cherished pho ga chicken soup  when i came home i was super stoked to see how much they give you for 600  plenty of noodles plenty of bean sprouts and my favorite and this is where most restaurants fall short is they do not skimp on the basil  they are also very generous with the jalapenos and cilantro  overall i would absolutely consider this restaurant my goto place when that pho craving hits,1.0

the beef was all fat the sauces were overly salty and tons of msgfirst plate of beef looked ok but the second was just a plate of fat and the color of the meat looked strange low quality meat tofu was sour as well i like the concept of bringing the meats to your table it is more hygenic i get it but the quality of meat brought to us was just abysmali think that they add tons of mgs in the broth because i had drank 5 glasses of liquids at their restaurant and went home with dry mouth along with everyone else in our group at night i had drank another 2 glasses of water and in the morning still dry mouth i think that they add salt to their sauces and msg to their broth to make people drink more and eat less brilliantservice there is good and bad the lady server was very nice and did a great job the young guy server was rude and condescending you have to speak english to get great service from that guy we waited 20 minutes for a plate of lamb and when we asked when it would come he said wait your turn uhh i have ordered 20 minutes ago what  turn the people at the table next to us caucasians spoke english and everything with them was yes sir and right away and they got their meats 2 minutes from the time they ordered other chinese people at the table next to us said the same thing about the servicethere was a large group next to us that had to have 20 people and they were complaining that they only brought 10 shrimps for 20 people haha everybody got 12 a shrimp to eatnever again will i go here owner very shrewd business peoplebtw if you go here on friday night dont worry no lineups,0.0

i am sorry to learn that this company has continued to victimize other individuals i am posting my experience on this website also documented on another website to help wouldbevictims mitigate engaging this moving company please note that capital moving is also affiliatedassociated with vegas line moving and storage servicesi am a student who engaged capital moving services to move from vancouver to montreal i used this company because they offered the best cost quote when my items were delivered capital moving services requires that you pay them before the items are moved off the truck i was careful to check off the inventoried items as inventoried by capital moving and myself when they were picked up in vancouver as they were taken off the truck one box of items valuing approximately 2500 did not appear when i asked about the missing box the mover said oh yes they knew about the missing box i followed up with capital moving services right away and they indicated that they were looking for the box over the following 8 days i had to contact them numerous times they didnt follow up with me at their instruction i then finally filed a claim form because i had purchased 2000 of declared value insurance for 42 4 weeks later i had not heard back so i followed up and was told that a claim response was going to be sent out upon receipt of the report the following week indicated that i was entitled to  200061 items where an item is a box broom wood futon piece etc  3278  300 deductible   0 compensation i sent an email indicating that i would not accept their claim response for nondelivery my box of items i received an email response from the manager eb indicating that they could provide some nominal compensation when i filed a complaint through the better business bureau eb eventually offered a 75 compensation credit i did not accept this offer for the 2500 worth of nondelivered boxed items and alarmingly the bbb has closed the case and indicated bureau judged complaint resolved moreover the bbb agent that handled this case refused to change this claim resolution so the lesson is to consult the bbb website regarding complaints for a company but ignore the bbb conclusions as they may not represent the true case result unfortunately such problems with specific bbbs have been noted before  you can google midwestern and central ontario better business bureau and beware to view i hope that in describing this ordeal it will mitigate further victims of capital moving services in short dont use capital moving services your moved items are not safe and may not be returned to you and as other capital moving customers have indicated one way or another it is going to cost you much more than you expected,0.0

sandra is very professional and an outstanding chef and i would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a private chef sandra was very flexible and as excited about my very unique request to dine in the dark for a special occasion as i was she designed a delicious menu that hit our palates perfectly with little to no guidance other than a quick review of our wine rack and learning that we are foodies if sandra had not told me that this was her first experience serving a couple who intentionally could not see and had no prior knowledge of the menu i would have never known because she was so cognitive of the unique challenges we would be facing by not being able to see sandra was outstanding in her planning and execution and brought everything that was needed i am looking forward to working with sandra again in the very near future maybe for another dinner in the dark,1.0

this place is legit first of all i appreciated the fact that they have a decent amount of seating so for a wednesday around 1030 5 of us were able to just sit down by the time we left completely different story after eating breakfast here i totally get why it was packed when we left i promise i will get to the corned beef soon the service was pretty good the women must have been working there forever and they really are excited to see people come in we got our food super fast and had as much coffee available to us that we could ever want the menu was pretty basic but lets face it we were all there for one thing and one thing only they had other breakfast and lunch items if you are the one person in cleveland that doesnt like corned beef when first looking through the menu i thought the corned beef prices were pretty high and then i saw what they gave you and it all made sense the sandwiches are huge no one actually needs that much food but this corned beef basically melts in your mouth so i can totally see how people eat it all i ordered a corned beef breakfast sandwich with corned beef egg and swiss cheese of course in rye bread so good  our table also ordered the corned beef hash with eggs also amazing this was totally worth the trip if you are a corned beef fan you must come here it is worth the drive downtown you will leave happy and with a full belly,1.0

i hired this company to perform handyman services only some of which were completed satisfactorily i was only offered a refund of one hour of labori contacted this company to perform certain services including plumbing and do not think i was remiss in expecting a handyman with skills to perform these specific tasks  of the eight repairs needed the three biggest and most involved were not completed satisfactorily or at all in one instance i asked the company to discover and repair the source of a warped board in my guest bathroom and to replace the board the worker lifted the toilet to replace a wax ring he put epoxy on the existing board and reset it it remains out of alignment with the rest of the flooring not flat he never discussed additional costs for labor to lift and replace the board in subsequent communications the owner has provided three different reasons for why this work was not performedi asked the company to replace my kitchen faucet the worker who admitted he is a roofer versus a plumber or true multidisciplined handyman by profession did not know how to turn the water off to my entire condo versus just the sink itself and did not tell me that he was not authorized to replace valves which proved to be part of the necessary work he sent me to lowes to purchase parts in the wrong size or that are nonexistent i only got the right ones thanks to the professionals there he advised me to find out how to shut the water off and that when i did he would return to complete the repairs instead the owner told me that i would have to call a plumber to complete the repair because his workers are not allowed to replace valves he said he advised his employee to tell me this but he did noti asked the company to replace my bathroom faucet the worker did so but left me with a host of new issues including significantly reduced water pressure and significantly increased wait time for hot water to arrive in the sink i did not have these issues before the faucet was replaced the owner of the company blames these brandnew issues on my selection of faucet rather than his employees incompetence when a trained professional plumber came to my home to make the kitchen faucet repairs that were not made by this company he was able to resolve my bathroom faucet issues with a few simple quick tweaksthe owner of the company who came to my home on july 4 to assess the situation responded to my july 7 request for a status update and discussion of a partial refund with a lengthy personalattack email among other things calling me passiveaggressive and ignorant accusing me of demanding free service verbal and attitudinal abuse and most unbelievably calling into question my faith with the words i hope that you find your place at the foot of the cross this sanctimonious selfrighteousness is entirely inappropriate in a business setting as is this completely unwarranted personal attack on me i hired this company to perform certain tasks in my home and expected to have hired skilled professionals that was not the case at no point did i personally attack the owner for conducting business in such an unethical fashion i was truly stunned to be addressed in such a disrespectful and unprofessional manner he continued his personal attacks in the public forum of the bbb website and refused to refund the money i paid for work that was not completed at all or not completed satisfactorily beware of engaging this company for any services,0.0

worst customer service ive ever experiencedno fucking lie put down my balls all in worst customer servicewe bought the groupon deal cool 35 its confirmed emailed we showed them they said we have to wait 45 minutes to go in their system well tell you when its ready  okay how the hell do you know who i am for you to tell me its ready can you check with my order number if its ready she said no well tell you and im thinking how the hell does she know who i amcome in 45 minutes later she asks me for my id tells me its not ready she asked me for my id i thought she knew who i  was tells me to check back in line in 10 minutes not ready and cant find me  asks me for my order number when i asked her if she can look up the order number since its already confirmed her name is danielle maybe its not her but fuck this place and service and groupon deal you dont fucking take money and expect a customer to wait 451hr after the order is confirmed with invoice and everything,0.0
i checked into the d hotel for the evening and was greeted at the registration desk by a nice polite young lady during checkin i was asked if i ever stayed at the d hotel i said no that i have been staying at another hotel on fremont street for several years and decided to try the d the young lady welcomed me and checked me into a nice room on the 16th floor it was in fact a very nice room after going to my room i returned to the casino and fremont st i returned to my room later in the evening to retire for the nightwell at 558am i was awakened by hammering and power tools on the 17th floor right above my room and this continued for the rest of the morningwhile checking out i was again greeted by the same young lady who had checked me in on wed i asked her what the hammering was that wakened me at 558am and she replied that the whole 17th floor was being renovated and that the work was not supposed to start until 600ammy question is why if the young lady at the checkin desk knew this information on wed would she put me in a nice room on the 16th floor if she would have told me at my check in that there was work being done on the 17th floor i would have asked for a different room on a different floor im sure the hotel wasnt full on a wed night and if that was the case i would have chosen a different hotel,0.0
didnt want to review the place until i had the food  the first two times i went i was on a liquid diet  on my quest to find a cool place to watch the world cup games my coworker told me about ca  my first visit was for the usengland game it was an awesome experience  even though the us fans were out numbered a bit we represented  besides a couple cheeky remarks everyone got along wonderfully  second visit to ca was for the the usalgeria game and unless you are a hermit we all know what happen that game  epicness happened  when donovan scored that goal it was absolute bedlam  it is was one of the greatest moments of my life  what a great feeling to celebrate something like that with your fellow countrymen and women  but just like the england game all i had was beerit wasnt until recently that i had the food  i was in the area and decided to give the food a try  and im glad i did  i had the fish and chips and they were good  im not really a fish guy but i thought i would have the house specialty  the truth is i would give this place a four star but since i experienced one of the greatest thrills of my life it gets a five  ca is hands down the best place in vegas to watch soccer and the food is good,1.0

this place is great we pulled in early and was assigned an area depending on if we wanted covered parking or not right away the shuttle pulled up while we were pulling our bags out of the car the driver was very helpful and then after few stops we were whisked away to our terminal on our arrival back home finding a shuttle back to the lot was a breeze and didnt wait at all we were again whisked back to the lot and immediately to our car again the driver was very helpful with our bags on our way out to pay we each received water bottle and it was such an awesome treat since we were parched from our early morning mostly sleeping flight we used our aaa discount and got a great deal so if you have aaa i recommend printing out the coupon from the aaa website we will definitely use this place again and its better than inconveniencing your brothercousin to drop you off at the airport and your sister yelling at you wondering where you are standing at the terminal doors,1.0
alona is an awesome team player there was a problem with my order and she took initiative immediately and took care of the situation with a smile if shes not a manager she should become one you should take good care of her so that she will stay on board she is an asset  another thing that stood out to me is that she was the only one who picked up the receipts off of the ground while all the other employees just walked past them to be fair it was very busy eight friday night however she was also busy and she did not just walk past them she pick them up thats a sign of great work ethic pride in her work,1.0

the service here is downright appalling we made a reservation a week in advance and upon arriving a few minutes before our scheduled time they did not have our reservation down we told them when we had called and even showed them in our phone the owner said they just did not have it and there was nothing they could do even though it was their mistake no offer of a discount or to squeeze us into the back to make up for losing our reservation they offered to sit us outside in the humid 95 degree weather they were rude and should really be ashamed i could tell the waitress looked apologetic but the owner could care less hope the food makes up for the horrific service but due to how we were treated and how hot it was outside we did not stick around to find out,0.0

this is perhaps one of the slowest starbucks i have ever been to yes it is very busy especially when there is a convention or two or three going on but even with two sets of registers to take peoples orders it took forever to get to the front of the line and then another long wait to wait for the drinks to be madealso i was very annoyed that they wouldnt let me use my reusable mug it was such as waste of cups to make my drink in their plastic cups which i threw away immediately after pouring the drink into my reusable mug shouldnt they be more sustainableminded in this day and age especially when every other starbucks will gladly let you use your own reusable cup and they even usually encourage it by giving your a little bit of a discount what a wasteon top of that everything is marked up and overpriced probably because its inside the convention center they charged me extra for the soy milk thats supposed to be included in a regular iced coffee with milk on top of the overall higher prices i ended up paying almost 9 for an iced coffee and a fruit cup ridiculous,0.0

i love qdoba but this specific qdoba is nightmare fuel first off when you walk in its dark and dirty and smelled like a school cafeteria not a good smell every table was dirty as well i should have left but for some god forsaken reason i stayed and proceeded to head up front to order the woman behind the counter looked very disheveled she had stains and food all over her shirt pants pretty much falling off her ass they were so loose food covering her un gloved hands and on top of that she didnt say hello or welcome or anything instead she just says what do you want umm i want you to get off your ass and clean this place lol but i didnt say that i told her my order and it was shortly after when i noticed this woman doesnt even know how to wrap a burrito she literally put the meat cheese etc in and rolled it like a play doh snake or some shit both ends wide open for all the stuff to fall right out  long story short i suggest think twice before going to this qdoba,0.0

had a wonderful time  we were here 4 days and 3 nights and only left the property a handful of times  the room was wonderfully appointed with very minimal signs of any wear  what you see in the pictures is pretty much exactly what you getcheck in was a breeze  the line moved very quickly  all hands were on deck at the front desk while we waited cold water was being offered to everyone in line very nice touch  the front desk itself isnt all that grand to be honest  i wasnt impressed but i wasnt disappointed either  not as nice as the front desk at the wynn  the casino here is actually pretty small  we found ourselves walking to the casino at the wynn often but not a deal breaker since its all connected and only a short walk  cocktail service was exceptional   always had a drink on my hand  wonderful during our stay we also saw le reve which was awesome    highly recommend watching the show if youve never seen it   best of all its just a short walk   since its connected to the hotel we were able to dress up for the show and not worry about the terrible heat outsideour room had a connecting door but we never heard the neighbors at all  only thing we ever heard actually was just the door but thats only  because all the doors here are large and heavy our room was facing the pool strip and the front desk did warn us it would be loud at night  i had no problem sleeping at night but my bf did so if your a light sleeper definitely bring ear plugs not sure if it was just this time but the air being pumped into the casinohotel wasnt scented which is no big deal really but i always love it when a hotel smells nice  the pool was alright   a bit small  definitely more of a place to socialize than to swim  they play music but its very low  i guess maybe the keeps the crowds down   the pool was busy but plenty of space to not feel crammedhousekeeping  you are fantastic   late in the day we called to have our room made up and usually at other hotels it will take hours and hours before anyone shows up if at all but to our delight the room was made up super fast   we called housekeeping as we were walking out to gamble and maybe two hours later we came back up to get ready for a show and everything had been put back into place   chocolates and slippers were left beside with a cute little note and she found my ring   could not have been happier  as great as our experience was there was only one thing that fell short  on our last night we stayed up too late so we called front desk and inquired if we could pay for the late check out or add an additional night if that wasnt available  front desk was polite but states that they were fully booked and couldnt accommodate my request  ok no problem  my fault anyway for staying up too late n all  later that evening while having lunch i decided to check online just for kicks to see if they were fully booked since i thought it was odd being that it was a sunday and sure enough they have rooms available   worst yet was because it was a sunday the rate was very affordable  so that was a let down  really wanted to stay another day to just chill and gamble,1.0

i think the only reason i havent written a review for robertos is that i try so hard to pretend that it doesnt existthis location is now known as don tortaco although the staff told me  at least i think they did through the muttering  that its the same as robertos i know that nothing has changed menuwise or decorwiseive been to this robertosdon tortacos three times the first time was about five years ago i had the cheese enchiladas they were like a nasty gravy with two lumps of cheese log my mouth felt all gaggy not long after eating them shoot there go my dreams of 247 mexican right around the cornerno you have to try the burritos thats what everyone said but my first experience was so bad that i wasnt going to risk another visit and im not really a fan of places where people make excuses for the food based on the one thing the restaurant supposedly does wellyears passed i finally had a burrito at another robertos it was more or less inoffensive more or less hmm okayencouraged two weeks ago i had a bean and cheese burrito at this location and it was okay i could see eating it in a lazy moment if it were quite late and i was quite tired and i was very hungry and in this case all of these factors were present the burrito lacked any fresh ingredients at all but for the price no surprise and there is a sort of salad bar with salsa whole spring onions  carrots and so forth with sandwich bags and little plastic cups if you want to dress your takeaway up wilty and grubby but somethingso a week ago i found myself in similar tiredlatehungry circumstances so i popped down the street for another burrito cheese enchiladas and a bean tostada the last item alone took several minutes to order as the staff seemed to have as hard a time conveying information in english as receiving it i figured that since the burrito wasnt so awful last time id give everything a chancethe look of the cheese enchiladas has vastly improved the taste has too but it still wasnt good i had three or four bites before i asked myself what the heck i was doing and stoppedthe bean tostada was composed of possibly the grossest tortillabased product ive ever put in my mouth the tostada shell was chewy like a rice krispies treat and covered in what i will call beanbased muck a little shredded lettuce was sprinkled over that im not sure how i got to the second bite but i certainly went no furtherand the burrito was just like someone had scraped some room temperature refried beans straight from a can onto a dayold tortilla except not that good again two bites one to taste and one more to confirm that indeed all three items id ordered were just plain yuckyi got to think about this a lot the next day when i stayed home from work to catch up on my sleep what with having been up all night in porcelainbased penance for those eight bitesim never eating here again why theres a grocery store right across the street forget tiredhungrylate  i will never be so lazy to eat food this bad again,0.0

ive been here a couple of times over the last two weeks and have not been happy with the quality at this locationfoodits okay  ive had better northern chinese cuisine uptown and it still doesnt compare to my favourite place ningtu in vancouver  the portion sizes are small and especially disappointing when we order from a set menu for 10 people and it probably was good for 68  the two lobsters looked like all the pieces werent there  even the efu noodle dish was small and rice and noodles are usually fairly large in quantity given theyre the filler  the worst was that we ordered peking duck as a substitute and when the lettuce wrap part came they didnt have enough lettuce wrap for the whole table ie less than 1 leaf per person seated and we were around 8  we ordered more and they charged us for the extra lettuce  their red bean pancake was good though but dont order the red bean in meringue  they didnt turn out well oily and dense vs fluffy and lightservicerestaurant wasnt busy and service was still slow and not attentive  it seems they arent used to doing banquet dinners because they were slow at clearing plates getting drinks cutlery etcneedless to say i will not be coming back here again despite its proximity to me,0.0

yes to all of the above  woodlands is simply fantasticthough wed been wanting to try it for a while we hadnt trekked out to woodlands simply because it was in our eyes all the way out in the boonies off albemarle road  despite growing up in the clt i can count on one hand the times i have actually driven on albemarle road imagine my surprise then when we passed the old eastland mall and i was all ohhhh this is where eastland used to be  anywaylast night however searching for a restaurant that wasnt participating in restaurant week we decided to head out to woodlands and we were pleasantly surprised when it took us less than 15 minutes to get out there  excellent  despite previous reviews the exterior and decor werent particularly offputting it seems to me that almost every great indian place ive eaten at has a very similar setup udipi in cary anyone so it felt like homei do love opening a menu and knowing i can order anything off it  this time i settled on the chefs specialty of chana batura and husband ordered aloo gobi and garlic naan  the puffy bread with my dish was like a light unsweetened funnel cake  fried indulgent deliciousness  and it sopped up the chana so very well  the chana were perfect  husbands aloo gobi was so delicate and tasty and the garlic naan just blew me away  yum to absolutely everything  we also ordered a couple samosas which were also perfect just the right amount of spice and flaky beyond beliefthe service was excellent for what its worth although weve got maharani around the corner which i like very much as well as copper which underwhelms me despite all its hoopla i imagine well be making the wellworthit drive out to woodlands when were in the mood for particularly fabulous indian food  love this place,1.0

yelps 365 review challenge  los angeles 5  365ever since i started listening to boys ii men back in the 90s from cassette tapes cds and now itunes ive fallen in love with their soft harmonies acapellas and no auto tune cough cough brittney spearsits located in the terry fator theater located pass the mirage elevators through the mall and near the convention center phew thats a good 10 minute exercise just from the casino the showroom feels very intimate compared to large venues like celine dion and there are no bad seats in the house i grew up listening to boys ii men in school and till this day they still sound the same plus no lip synching this shows how much talent they have and arent fake with some music artist and still value their long term fans  unfortunately one of the members has retired michael mccary  due to back problems and personal issues the group now performs as a trio and has remained strong without the 4th member they even admit its hard to perform some of their songs without michael mccary they are still strong in my book throughout their performance they through some jokes showed some hilarious youtube videos of their fans singing their famous songs and passed out roses when they sang their song ill make love to you im just glad to have seen boys ii men before they fully retire and cant wait to see them a second time tip they allow pictures and video cameras throughout the show,1.0
cool concept the nitrogen and all definitely draws in kiddos and long lines very limited amount of space inside the product itself however was extremely overpriced and not very good you dont exactly know what youre buying unless you ask there arent really any signs to say that youre about to purchase cereal puffs from what you can tell youre buying nitrogen infused balls of something and it looks like youre blowing smoke out of your nose and mouth when you eat it its not very tasty we ate a couple puffs and then we were over it threw more than half of it away paid over 7 for it too also not sure how they can label themselves an ice cream shop on other sites like google and facebook its certainly not ice cream definitely will not be going back my kid did enjoy for like point five seconds nitrogen infused food is super cool cereal puffs not so much i feel they could serve something better especially for the price,0.0
i have to say my experience here was awesome  from the waiter to the cool contemporary decor to the great pizzas   everything was a joy  we started the evening with a plethora of draft beer selection and martinis all were excellent  then our calamari was huge and very ono now there arent many places who offer gluten free and this place offers it on all their selections and styles of pizza good eats great service and a rockin experience,1.0

what a great place in all aspects the atmosphere is energetic but not so much as to be a distraction  service was excellent throughout from the moment we arrived until we bid a good night penny was our primary server and she met our every need even anticipating a few the staff works well as a team and contribute a great deal to the successful operation of devillethe front room has the main bar and some tables the back of the restaurant is up a half flight of stairs  the kitchen is half a flight down and you can get a good view of the action as you go to your tablethe decor is delightful  modern diner elements are tastefully merged into a comfortable and vibrant atmosphere the menu is based on traditional diner comfort food but often with a modern touch  being in montreal we had to try the disco poutine the fries were hot thin and crispy and the disco gravy paired very well for this variation i had a burger with cheese and bacon the sandwich was of considerable size and i had to resort to fork and knife halfway through my friend had the hanger steak special and it was majestically presented on a wood butcher block with an impressive mashed potato side  he was quite impressed with the taste and quality of the steakas a treat i ordered a strawberry shake or frappe as we call it in new england very wellmade and flavorful it was presented in a traditional style ice cream fountain glass complete with a metal frame handle thank you penny  staff for a delightful evening,1.0

theres nothing not to loveits rare to find a place thats so unusual in the middle of phoenix everything is good and they have these french pancakes that i cant resist getting each time i go thats a problem because their pizza is so good so now i figure ill still get the french pancakes and take a pizza home for dinneri just like the whole atmosphere very city like with tight cramped rows of grocery items and gifts along with tables scattered about to sit and enjoy the weather sandwiches breakfast pizza and dont forget the most beautiful decorated cakes ive ever seen i have yet to try them because they appear dangerous to my thighs,1.0

never go near this place under any circumstance not only the noisy neighbors stomping upstairs but also the big leak in the closet which is pouring out water for the last day another bad incident happened later on when i moved out of the apt and they put me in collections even though i paid more than i owed the manager tried to leave me with bad credit and no explanation what a nightmare you will be dealing with if you move in here,0.0
wow  this place absolutely floored me  it was october 2nd and and a group of 13 of us showed up by limosuine to celebrate my wifes 30th birthday  i had spoken to a gentleman on the phone a few days before to reserve a table and he happily saved one for uswithout even requiring bottle service  when we arrived we were given corner seating with an innocent but inviting metal pole nearby  drinks were stiff and our server was patient and efficient  it was relatively slow when we arrived and the dj was thoughtful enough to base his volume level on the club populationvibe  the music was superb for duration of our stay  there is an outdoor fencedoff area for the smokers  the bathrooms are coed and wellappointed  we were on a strict schedule and had to leave to devils martini for bottle service after only an hour and a half but most of us wished we couldve stay longer  i cannot wait to return,1.0
im not a big fan of breakfast places or breakfast at all ben  florentine is decent but still doesnt make me want to eat there or have breakfast plus its expensive but this place is a different storyive come here twice now and i plan on coming many more times both times ive been greeted by the same very friendly waitress who has been very attentive and speedy the place is well lit clean and feels invitingonto the food ive ordered the same thing twice because the first time was amazing and i needed to know if the food was consistent it was the bacon is some of the best cooked bacon ive ever had the eggs were perfect and the home fries were also perfect i will update this review if that changes but for now 55,1.0
this is the worst in vegas to spend your time  even at the discount we got on tickets it was way over priced  first of all they had a drink minimum that i was not aware of when i purchased the tickets  the drinks we were forced to buy were awful and the comedy was not very funny  the burlesque dancers were not that great looking and not that great at dancing  you would think they could find much prettier and talented dancers in vegas  do not waste your time or money here  go to the pinball museum instead,0.0

when i first was booking my megabus ticket from pittsburgh to nyc i was very skeptical about taking the megabus because of the reviews especially because i was going to take an overnight bus dont worry  the bus was great the bus drivers were nice yes they were bold but also hilarious i slept like a baby but would wake up at the rest stops if you are traveling alone and are freaking out a bit there are tons of people on the bus and you automatically feel safe hop on and enjoy this affordable bus ride,1.0

i am really happy with the staff over at findlay fiat  i have referred several friends and family to the store to purchase vehicles  they call their showroom a studio and its decorated like a cool swanky design center  they give customers a warm welcome when they enter and ensure the customers are comfortable with their purchase  they always have a good amount of preowned options not just fiat  give them a try for your purchase  the dealership is smaller than most so it has more of a family feel,1.0
my husband daughter and i went to this restaurant today for lunch it was 230 pm and there were approximately 20 people already in the restaurant eating  when we were waiting to be seated one of the staff members came to tell us they were closing its 230 in the afternoon why would they be closing early on a saturday also their website states they close at 11 pm so that was really weird i had to look down to see the color of my skin to figure out why they were all of a sudden closing so early but thats okay i would much rather give my hard earned money to a company that respect and values their customers regardless of  what race they are i drove about a mile up the street to another restaurant called india oven masala i had no issues there their food was great and their service was awesome as well so i will definitely recommend going to that restaurant instead,1.0

giving them one more chance never really enjoyed the food before usually too bland for my taste  but we sat for 10 minutes when it was relatively slow as it was 430 at least 3 servers walked by our table more than once people seated after us were greeted within the typical minute and still we sat  there are many flaws i can tolerate but just stopping in after a customer is seated should be such a simple step  sadly it seems to be hard at this location,0.0

easy hike beautiful vistas pretty rocks small stream thats the review in a nutshell this is a good intro hike for the red rock canyon area its a 3 mile outandback that runs from the roadside across the valley floor to the mouth of a canyon the trail is wide and easy with a slight incline all the way out as you get closer to the canyon it starts to get narrower and branch off into a bunch of different directions if your goal is to make it to the mouth of the canyon it doesnt really matter which one you take they all converge back at the canyon if you want to find the waterfall you supposedly turn right at the first tree we didnt seek it out but instead headed for the canyon mouth it gets a little more scrambley as you get close to the canyon mouth but the views keep getting better and better  along the way youre exposed to sweeping views across the canyon floor with the red rocks to the north commanding cliffs to the west the road and gypsum mines back to the east and valleymountains to the south on a nice day you can see for miles and miles our group included folks from 4078 years in age and everyone did just fine trail is a mix of sanddirt and rocks because its an outandback whenever the scramble gets to be too much just turn around rock climbing up in the canyon is a thing you can fly drones here and the topology is worth it we didnt see any wild horses or burros dammit but did see a woodpecker cold winter though so im sure all the animals were camped out somewhere else 55 would hike again,1.0

this place is way overpriced for the old falling apart smelly pests infested dirty breeze ways birds poops on sideways high crime frequent robberies stolen vandalized cars living the only reason for one star is that the previous management seemed to be in my experience more accommodating than the new current management,0.0
the food here was really great i came here with five other people and we shared everything so it was a great way to taste most of the items on the menui started with the lange de lassassinat for cocktails its 25 ounces and at 15 it didnt blow my mind it honestly tasted like lime juice with some sparkling water and a little bit of alcohol so i was a little disappointedto begin we had the cheese platter and the toast with a quails egg blood sausage and shrimp on top the latter was really divine we also got the sweetbreads with tuna a definite favourite the razor clams were great but a little too lemony and sour for my liking the patatas bravas were amaaazing the bone marrow paled in comparison to everything else and the chimichurri sauce was too overpowering and didnt let the bone marrow shine through our final dish was half an octopus over potatoes and rapinidandelion  greens this dish was also amazing the octopus was cooked just right and the potatoes were so good but the greens were way too bitterto end we had the basque cake  divine highly recommend this place you have to make an order of bread separately and i made the mistake of eating too much bread,1.0

i really dont have enough nice things to say about this placethis cashonly bar is clean and wellmaintained there is a pool table and one or two electronic games inside the establishment and at least a dozen huge flat screen tvs to watch your teams play they have a loaded jukebox and on fridays they host karaoke out back is a patio where you can watch the game and play corn hole they serve beer by the bottle and can 250 and wine 5 a glass only no liquor this gives the place a kind of throw back feel its relaxed and none of the patrons get out of hand on jager shotsi cant review the food because i dont eat burgers and hot dogs beef and pork but everyone who was eating seemed to really enjoy it apparently the chili recipe is literally a family secret that has been passed down through the generationswe recently threw a surprise 70th birthday party for my father an oneils regular at the bar the management was super accommodating and everything went off without a hitch they let us bring our own food gave us a discount on our open bar and made every effort to make the party a successi wouldnt recommend this place to someone looking for a fancy night out but if you like cinderblock saloons where the bartender will learn your name this is the place for you,1.0

sorry this is very unfortunate  was really looking forward to trying this place kupd fan  take out order for a small group for the nfl football championship games  expected it to be busy but business was extremely slow and this is why first off everything was extremely salty  smoked wings very over cooked actually so over cooked they were hard as a rock  same with the brisket over cooked tough and burnt  opposite for the fried pickles soggy like mush  most of the food was thrown away before the end of the first quarter  would not recommend this place,0.0
i love this little boutique   the owner searches for the latest styles and there something for everyone young and older  i just bought the cutest dress with a cut out in the back i cant wait to wear it  the shop also carries some really nice jewelry and purses  and she also carries some candles that smell fabulous it a great place to find something unique,1.0
i live in a part of toronto that is completely inundated with balcony happy pigeons  they love to sit on your railing and poop their little hearts out  my balcony was covered in about 2 years worth of poop dust bunnies cigarette ashes and spilled drinks  all baked in by hot summer sun  derrick from multiservices came in and basically made my balcony look brand new over the course of 1 hour  new  i could not believe it   all stains and debris were totally removed and sanitized from the balcony floor windows and sliding screen door  nothing was spilled out onto units below me  i was very very impressed  not only was derrick professional on time and respectful of the unit he was also a super nice guy  tip for pigeon problemsbuy a slinky mount it across the top of your railing to stop the pigeons from hanging out and doing their biz on your balcony  since my cleaning ive keep the balcony clutter free and the pigeons seem to not be interested in visiting me  its been 3 weeks and no poop,1.0
tucked in the corner inside of the iga grocery store this is a hidden gem of a coffee shop its not what youd expect in a grocery store because its in the corner the setting is quiet and cozy without the noise of even a typical shop coffee options are great and the prices are cheaper than anything youd find in the cu area deb has a wonderful personality and gets her roasts fresh from columbia street right in town definitely check it out and grab a few chocolates or pastries to top it off,1.0
i admit i was a skeptica plethora of vegan options at a las vegas buffet  get out of here thats a lie  but its true i couldnt believe my eyes  before we paid to get into the buffet i inquired about these socalled vegan options thinking that there may only be one or two things for me  to my surprise they gave me the option to have a chef personally walk me around and tell me whats veganfriendly and what can be made vegan upon request  the chef was great personable and very knowledgeable about the plantbased diet  he walked me through every dish and nearly every ingredient i felt like i was getting startreatment  at the end of my little tour i realized i could have at least half of the offerings on the buffetand that my friends is exactly what i did  i never get to eat at buffets i exercise and eat healthy at home so why not  i enjoyed many things such as alfredo pasta custommade at the pasta station many different kinds of salads quinoa salad chickpea salad etc many kinds of veggies vegan tomato soup sushi ethnic dishes aloo gobi channa masala etc candied apples and the best vegan chocolate chip cookie baked on this planet  mind you there were many vegan things i just couldnt get toi filled up sooner than i would have liked  overall this was a great experience the wynn is simply impressive  i highly recommend the buffet to vegans vegetarians and omnivores alike,1.0
my favorite mexican food i always order  a machaca potato and extra cheese burro the cheese quesadillas and tortillas are delicious too i like to wash it down with some of their horchata i am not a fan of eating at the restaurant as its a little ghetto but it is very clean i recommend calling in the order since it gets really busy sometimes,1.0
i attended the breakfast buffet at 730am with a few office teammates and was blown away by the experience the restaurant itself matches the style of the fairmont palliser in opulence and open design lending itself well to having a conversation and the staff were very friendly and attentive  especially noteworthy given the hour we were diningthe buffet selection was diverse and included such staples as eggs benedict waffles and omelettes in addition to a great selection of pastries and fruit overall the experience was memorable and i wouldnt hesitate to visit again or recommend it to friends,1.0

we walked inside the restaurant very excited to eat at this famous restaurant for dinner and when we entered inside this seemingly authentic indian restaurant we found it almost empty with none of the hotel staff anywhere in sight and just a couple of diners sitting in one table we decided to wait for a couple of minutes to see if anyone from the staff would appear but no one showed up after waiting for 5 minutes we decided to leave it was extremely disappointing that a restaurant with such good reputation would give us such a terrible experience,0.0
my experience at cycle gear was extremely positive the manager keith was fantastic and helped me a novice cyclist and first time helmet buyer both feel good about what i wanted to buy with confidence and did a great job explaining things keiths customer service was fantastic he took the time to explain the options for me the pros and cons of different types of helmets and was very knowledgeable  i would definitely come back to cycle gear based on the products but more importantly the customer service by keith if his bosses read this review they should be very happy with his work,1.0

worst customer service came in to get a gender reveal piata and spoke to someone on the phone who said we could drop off the results and they would prepare everything for us we got there after our appointment with our results and the employees said they couldnt do it it would have to be a balloon and not a piata what is the difference it would have been even less work to just throw the stuff that we purchased into the piata but whatever we ended up asking a stranger in the store who was kind enough to set it up for us and the employees were annoyed that we even did that but oh well i think they were just being lazy and didnt feel like providing good customer service,0.0

this place is a rarity in the used car buying arena  my wife and i were looking for a prius plug in and what we happened upon through private party was extraordinarily expensive  through craigslist we found millenium auto network  they are a blip of the map driving down main st in mesa  they specialize in reliable hondas and toyotas and have a unique specialization in the prius  my impression from the entire experience   they are honest  upfront and trustworthy  we got an immediate sense of pressure free relaxation through the whole experience  almost like going to your favorite coffee shop or restaurant were the owners know you personally  no pressure whatsoever  they put the prices so low and their financing is so good its hard not to buy a car or truck from them   they even replaced a couple parts that were dented and cracked under the prius we found the next morning free of charge  i am a great judge of people and these people are exceptional and should be the standard in the car buying business  the owner brad and sales manager randy are good honest family people and i whole heartedly give them 5 stars ,1.0

been wanting a decent cheese steak and decided to give joes a try having spent most of my life in the philadelphia  south jersey area i know what a good cheese steak should taste like when i phoned in my order the employee immediately asked if i could hold and proceeded to drop the phone down on the counter and for two minutes i had the pleasure of hearing every  thing that went on in the store the flavor of the meat was very bland and the provolone cheese ordered could barely be tasted the sauteed onions had bits of onion skin in them that was totally inedible  the best thing that could be said about the sandwich was the roll was fresh the french fries were very soggy and undercooked never again,0.0

terrible service  the service was so incredibly bad that our food never arrivedmy friends and i visited on a friday night looking to try the place after the much instagram hype we had seen we were skeptical because of mixed reviews but thought wed give it a try the place was half full and we thought we were in luck for a friday nightafter placing our orders for 3 waffles we passed the time chatting it wasnt until we stopped chatting and noticed that 45 min had passed since we ordered we asked for a status on our ordersthe waiter advised that they would be coming in 10 min which we replied that the table next to us had finished eating they had arrived only a few minutes before us hilariously enough the waitress who had originally taken order dropped off an order slip at our table the slip read 943 pm and we realized that they had literally just put the order in they had forgot our order instead of apologizing they pretended as if it was on its waywe got up to leave and the waitress had the nerve to ask you dont want your orders so no review on food be can provided however based on the terrible service i doubt the food quality and believe the poor reviews of their food,0.0

not just coffee has hands down the best cappuccino in town and unless you tell them youre taking it to go they serve it in a proper cup with a saucer and spoon rather than a cardboard cup and plastic lidbecause this isnt a freakin mcdonalds but whether you take it to go or not they always do a little latte art with your foam presentation matters i wish more coffee places would learn thatif coffees not your thing the italian sodas are also the best around they make them with homemade syrups that feature not the typical sugary fruit flavors but subtle blends of fruit and herbs whats better than strawberry strawberry with basil thats what theyre always refreshing and never too sweet the only problem is that the cappuccino is so good i can rarely bring myself to try all the other flavors of italian soda,1.0

nothing negative to saydelicious carne asada cabeza pollo lenguaso many reviews that only talk about just the carne asada the menu is a bit more expansive than that minus the tripe not a fan of it there isnt anything on the menu i wouldnt recommend brought some foody friends here who know a good eat and they were very skeptical at the idea of arguably the best mex in phoenix being out of a truck after some burritos and tacos the critics were silenced if youre in the area and you dont stop here you are doing both yourself and your wallet a disservice,1.0

awesome place speedy service the gentlemen that work here are nice and friendly definitely will come back for another latte i might have a hard time not getting the vanilla sugar latte again but will try something else next time,1.0
this is my second time visiting this restaurant and i must say that i admire the consistency the carne asada was marinated and grilled to perfection and their campechano tacos tasted authentic which is something that ive been looking for in the phoenix valley along with the consistency of their food this place has a list of artisan tequilas mezcals and other mexican spirits i highly recommend grabbing a seat at the bar and asking one of the knowledgeable bartenders to give you an exploratory adventure through their premium agave spirits if you are a connoisseur of craft spirits you will not be disappointed the price point of the tacos here represents the quality of their products as well as the phenomenal preparation this is not the place to go if you are looking for a quick cheap taco that costs less than 2 dollars these tacos are 350 each or you can get a family style dish served on a hot plate with a side of 6 corn tortillas i recommend the second option because you are going to want to order more as soon as you put down the first round of tacos the preparation time for these tacos take time so patience is essential but as i keep saying it will be worth every minute and pennythe ambiance of this place is what you would expect for a hip upscale taco shop nestled in the roosevelt community it looks like its a historical building that was completely gutted and renovated with a fresh wood interior the open ceiling and floor to ceiling windows produces a warm communitylike environment that makes you want to walk around to other tables and make friends the bar is neatly organized and creates an eyecatching display of all the artisan spirits available for tasting the exterior of the building adds to the ambiance by remaining to keep its vintage look the service is exceptional both times i have visited i have sat at the bar the first time i enjoyed a great mescal that was recommended i forget the name but will be back to get it again my girlfriend got a margarita that was balanced to perfection to eat i first tried the carne asada tacos and immediately fell in love i ordered a second round of carne asada and also sampled the campechano which i fell in love with as well my girlfriend tried the naco torta and was more than satisfied naco torta consisted of fresh ripe avocado tender carne asada marinated to perfection an over medium egg and greens all on a toasted artisan bun after all of this food i couldnt help but order the churros with 3 different dipping sauces the churros were crispy on the outside with a warm fluffy but dense inside i personally enjoyed the chocolate dipping sauce but it also came with a leche and caramel sauceoverall i highly recommend this place to anyone in the phoenix community i will now be a loyal customer to this reastaurant because of the quality and consistency of the food service and of course tequila,1.0
i will not be returning here again the service is terrible it took two people to run run a register and one was a manager neither one knew what they were doing the salad bar appeared as if it was left out over nightthe pizza didnt look any better the sweet was boiling hot and the restroom was filthy and looked and smelled as if it hadnt been cleaned in days dont waste your time or money here,0.0
bummed tried this place twice now after reading all these good reviews i figured my first experience must had been a fluke so i went back to give it another try unfortunately my second experience was even worse this place is ran by young kids who are sweet but very unorganized and careless shouting across tables in this tiny restaurant  to ask where the missing food is and an obvious lack of professionalism which makes their extra long wait time akward and uncomfortable there is no music playing or anything to distract you and sitting under bright fluorescent lights unfortunately just really adds to the akward vibe now the important part is if the food was good i could care less about an akward vibe but the food is not good or fresh  my vegetables and meat tasted and looked old both times i visited i really wanted to like this place and gave it a second try hoping the second time would be better than the first but both times i was beyond let down if you want fresh quality ingredients  a clean and nice vibe this is not your spot,0.0

this is a warning about this company which seems to also be connected with md labs and some sort of supplement called the stuff  it is a fraud  how do i know  because if you try to take advantage of their customer satisfaction guarantee guess where your request for a refund goes  that would be straight to my po boxi am not affiliated with these people whatsoever and if you have been ripped off by them i suggest contacting your better business bureau  i have had my current box for over three years and as of yet they have not changed the information on their labels  as for your refund requests any that are sent to my box are promptly destroyed  it is sad that you are being ripped off by this company but it is also sad that you are gullible enough to believe their outrageous claims on their products when if you read the fine print on the label it even admits that its bs so save your money and seriously think twice about ever falling for herbal supplement claims  youre just throwing your money down a black hole and potentially damaging what health you may have,0.0

siobhan was my initial sales rep she made everything sound good charged me as agreed including installation and then on delivery day they just dumped the bed on me and ran no installation or removing of packing materialsi phoned and was told i hadnt paid for installation the warehouse manager was rude to begin with but more on that in a bit i had paid for installation and emailed sam at the store the invoice showing the charge equal to 10 of the cost of the bed shown as installation charge sam was not nice about it eitherthe warehouse manager wanted me to pay 80 for installation  if he did me a favour and sent a freelancer to do the job that evening he was downright insulting in the way he spoke  like i was trying to get something for nothing his ego was apparently hurt because he was proved wrong in that i had indeed paid for delivery  so to spite me he specifically asked the assembly guy to not touch the assembly of the bar stools and not take away any of the packing materials including those of the bed  the first was told to me by the assembly guy and the latter by eq3 customer servicei spoke with david at the warehouse who was much more of a gentleman camille at the store took over from sam and she too was more pleasant they have promised to clean up the old mess left behind which my aged father and i had to cut and store in the garage and both deliver and install my sofas coming next week with no traces of packing materials left behind for which they initially wanted an additional 60 and another 25 to screw in the legs of the sofa despite the sales invoice having these includedi have cancelled the coffee table order i placed with guenet subsequently as i never want to deal with these people againsiobhan never spoke with me or returned my phone calls throughout the process as these salespeople dont want to face the music after they have promised something and not delivered while i dont play games i do know how these people play the game they cant always be busy with customers to not be able to come to the phone or return callsi would rather go to upcountry nearby the king street eq3 store,0.0

there was nothing bad about our recent trip to montys   driving home from skiing decided to off the beaten path tired of bad chain restaurants   so glad we did   started off with bloody marys while we waited for a table  we had a group of 10 and it was a little cramped while waiting but drink in handso who cares   i ordered the burger and fries  excellent   melted cheddar in top   hubby ordered the meat loaf stack he cleaned his plate  several of the others ordered mac and cheese and milk shakes   i had no idea they were so large  you may want to consider sharing a milk shake seriously enormous   friendly service  excellent food,1.0
getting a massage at the ritzcarlton was an amazing and luxurious experience i came to my massage very early to enjoy the facilities mostly the pool and jacuzzi there are waiting rooms where you can read a magazine enjoy the fruit and have some tea it was so good that i ordered some later the bathrooms have lockers and lots of toiletries there are many products from clarins that you can sample for my massage i ordered a 90min deep tissue massage plus an additional 15 minutes of the foot ritual the massage therapist was excellent and even showed me particular stretches for helping to remove muscle tension at the end the deep tissue massage can be painful and is meant to be more therapeutic so try something else if you are aiming more for relaxation ie hot stone massage,1.0
i moved into this complex last year and its been an amazing experience its a small grouping of townhome apartments and its smack dab in the middle of the entire arrowhead area the front office folks are very nice and service requests are all handled quickly its also nice to have a garage although they are honestly a necessity as the main downside to this complex is a distinct lack of visitor parking putting my car in the garage frees up my driveway for one visitor but the public parking beyond that is close to nonexistenti honestly have had no problems here i needed a place to stay and save up some money towards a down payment on my own home for a year and bella vista fit that bill very nicely i would recommend it highly to anybody searching for an apartment,1.0

this really hurts my heart to be writing a review like this because pin kaow was my favorite restaurant but unfortunately i dont think that we will be returning anymorewe have been going to pin kaow every week religiously for the past 9 years we were going there when it was just the one restaurant on north rainbow blvdthe service was always great and the food was even better the kicker though was the prices they couldnt be beat this is what truly set them apart from all the other thai placesunfortunately i feel like  they have become more corporate like these daysas time went on i watched the prices go up multiple times and watched the portions get smaller and smaller they even got rid of their cute little uniforms that they had which was such a nice added touch to the experiencebut we still stood by them as we were always a loyal customerfor the past year my co workers and i have been going to the one on eastern every week on our lunch hour last week as always we went in and ordered our chicken fried rice and shrimp fried rice lunch special 30 minutes later we got our food at this time we placed an order for another shrimp fried rice lunch special to go it took 45 minutes for us to receive the food keep in mind they only had 3 other tables in the restaurant filled at this time we had to ask them twice about the to go order in which 30 minutes later the waitress comes up to the table to tell us that the order had been placed excuse me 30 minutes and 2 times checking and the order was just placed the only response that we get is a shrug of the shoulder with a smug sorry to go along with it as if we did something wrongneedless to say we were over 30 minutes late getting back to the office as we only have 1 hour for our lunch breaktoday we decided to give them another shot as mistakes and bad days do happen well it just about felt like groundhog day because here we go againwe place our order of crab rangoon and 3 lunch specials with another order of the chicken fried rice lunch special to go15 minutes later we were eating our crab rangoon with our soup that went with the lunch special that followed the only problem wasour lunch specials never came45 minutes later and with our lunch break being over we got up to ask them what was going on with our food as we were watching the other tables that had arrived 25 minutes after us enjoy their lunch the lady at the front said that she would check and then she never reported back to us 10 minutes later we checked on it again and they simply just handed us the bill with no explanation and no food we tell her to pack up our orders as there is no possible way for us to be able to sit and eat as we are already late we get back to the office keep in mind that we are now trying to have a bite here and there in between our patients and our food was not even sub par not at all it tasted like it had been sitting there for hours my shrimp in the fried rice was dried out the pad thai had no flavor and the chicken fried rice was floating in grease it was pretty much inedible needless to say we all ended up throwing our food out my co worker then called the restaurant to complain and was basically given the cold shoulder they again were acting as if we did something wrong we were told to bring the food back to the restaurant because we all have time in the world to run around town bringing food back and fourth during our work day after already being late to work because they couldnt get their act together we told them that we couldnt do that  after hearing all the  himing and hawing and being put on hold multiple times she told us that when we came back they would give us 15 off of our next bill really we wasted our hour long lunch gas money and our money on food that we ended up throwing out and you are giving us attitude as you offer us 15 really please aint nobody got time for that,0.0

as a newer yelper this is only my second review and beyond deserved  on our most recent trip to las vegas last weekend my boyfriend and i ended up unexpectedly at mastros ocean club in crystals inside city center for the first time  we go to vegas quite a bit about once every 2 months or so and have passed by this place quite a few times  the interestingly constructed architecture of the main dining area has been quite the source of amusement to us in the past it resembles something like the shell of a wooden submarine that has exit chutes above and below it to spit you out into crystals when you are done with your meal btw this is a joke  you do not get ejected from your seat  it is only my strange sense of humor that comes up with this stuff  my imaginative uses for the architecture aside the designlayout is nice it makes you feel as if the restaurant is floating in the middle of crystals with a very open and airy feelas we were walking through crystals on our way back to our hotel room at aria from a long day of shopping we decided to make an impromptu stop at the ejection submarine and see if there was any chance they would take us as walkins on a busy friday night  with it being such an upscale spot i was sure we would either be turned away without a reservation or asked to wait for a ridiculous amount of time  au contraire  they offered us immediate seating in the barlounge area or a few minute wait for the main dining room  since we felt a bit underdressed for the location we opted for the barlounge area and were glad we did  we had the perfect seat right next to the piano player and fiery redheaded chanteuse who was pleasantly entertaining we were promptly greeted by our amazing server sara  the only reason i know her name is because i made sure to ask her for it when we were leaving as i knew i wanted to review this place  sara was so attentive knowledgeable about menu friendly and always two steps ahead of us   really as perfect as a server can get  all of her recommendations were great as welli had the swordfish i hadnt met my mercury quota for the month yet and my boyfriend had the bonein ribeye  we shared the most delicious side dish  the alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi  my swordfish paired very well with gnocchi and it was the perfect combo of light and creamy  however my boyfriends ribeye wasnt anything stellar  it wasnt as flavorful as a most quality ribeyes should be  its on our donotorderagain list  this is an ocean club though so maybe that was his error for ordering one of the few nonseafood options  now  for the absolute best part of the meal the most heavenly dessert ever  mastros signature warm butter cake  even if the rest of the meal and service had been horrible which it was far from i would have given this place 5 stars just for this dessert  i dreamt about this cake the rest of our stay in vegas and cant wait to go back again on our next trip just to have it  this creation alone makes mastros ocean club one of my top 5 alltime favorite restaurants  i would happily get ejected from this seafaring vessel any time sorry for the ridiculously long review but i had so much to comment on and didnt know where to shorten it,1.0

i have had two encounters with pandora and have heard about a few more i usually do not give only one starshowever  after the 2nd encounter i feel that i should give honest feedback about my experience  i will try not to go into too much detail there was an issue about what information  i was given and when i tried to confirm  the information  i was told and i quote if i dont like it then dont come back i was absolutely  appalled so i called  and got the owner he tried to assure me that customer service was important i said ok i will  give it a second  chance  this is where it gets worse a friend called in to ask questions about cupcakes the lady was so rude to her over talked her and the had the audacity to announce she was the owner very smart ackley  and basically  if she didnt care for what she said nonthing was going to be done dont buy from us  it is the way it is now i understand rules what i dont understand is rudeness i dont understand how you own a business and yet you have rude customer service thats two times that i have rude customer service have pandora i will not go back to pandora cupcakes and i know i only have one voice however my voice counts they are not friendly people to deal with and obviously they dont care truly about customer service because their rudeness was unbelievable  fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me,0.0

im not one to complain but they have given me the worst pizza delivery i have ever experienced  pizza was delivered 25 minutes after what they estimated  that i can deal with  however after opening the pizza box it was wrong it was missing ingredients and meat was on the whole pizza when we ordered it only on half because we have a vegetarian in the house  we also ordered garlic knots that arrived much too undercooked to even eat and marinara sauce was missing  i should have checked before the delivery driver left  anyway i contacted them to request the correct pizza be delivered or for a refund  i was told i wouldnt receive a refund unless the entire wrong pizza was returned first  too bad two pieces had already been eaten  thankfully eat24 stepped in and had the correct pizza delivered but by that time we had lost our appetite and the terrible service left a bad taste in our mouths  listen to the reviews on here to avoid going through what many here have  very disappointed in my experience,0.0

this place has been a regular destination for us in cleveland for over a decade now and it continues to be a restaurant we recommend without hesitation  a huge vegetarian vegan and specialty menu decidedly friendly to those with specific culinary needs ie no gluten etc which succeeds in not isolating those folks who experience the onset of panic when vegetarian is mentioned  yes meat does exist here and yes im sure its tastily cooked and presented as wellwe pretty much only ever get the same meal when we come here which is ridiculous due to the massive selection available  the ceebee is freaking delicious however and i drool when thinking about it pita stuffed with falafel hummus bean sprouts cheese and some other wonderful things all heated together  im glad that theres only two portions included in the meal as i could probably gorge myself sick on this stuffim a big fan of tommys hummus as well which one can purchase as its own plate in either the normal or spiked variety which features everything from bbq sauce to the moon apparently  i tend to get the normal hummus plate sometimes with cheese to split with friends and were rarely disappointed  when i ate there recently however the hummus wasnt as up to par as it normally is  i suppose everyone has their off dayssnag a booth to eat in if you can as it enhances the overall aesthetic of the place  wood polished by the feet and rears of thousands random plants everywhere easy access to the bookstore next door show and concert posters crammed onto the wall in the entry foyer  generally tommys is clean welllit small groupfamilyfriendly and satisfying to the stomach  the servers are hit or miss as the place tends to employ its share of hipster kids who can either be friendly or awkwardly removed from normal social niceties  weve rarely had an issue with that howeverrecommended,1.0
this is my dream diner cozy friendly delicious the staff is incredibly friendly and knew tons of the customers by name sometimes closeknit places like that can feel unwelcoming to outsiders but they made me feel right at home even offering me a fresh outoftheoven gingerbread cookie while i waited for my food i had country poached eggs on jalapeno cornbread which was fantastic cornbread was on the moist side but it worked with the dish overall goodsized portion but not outrageous im definitely going back,1.0
its so difficult to find places that allow my baby paris maltipoo dog in that serves fresh and tasty goodies exploring charlotte i came across this cute spot and from the name i figured they would have no problem letting him in cute outside seating cozy rustic inside and the customer service was top notch visited on a sunday and it wasnt crazy busy but there were about 4 tables filled inside while only 1 table besides mine was taken outside ordered the iced mojito green tea and got too excited when i saw a gluten free peanut butter bar yesssss and it was oh so delicious definitely the perfect spot for relaxing getting work done reading a book this is not a place for a massive study group but stop in being 3 friends and order that peanut butter bar i couldve shared mine but naa ,1.0

i was really excited about the bagel factory opening in oakland as i love bagels  i purchased the groupon back in july and was told that it would open august 1  it didnt open until september and when it did they didnt accept the groupon though they assured me it would be accepted soon  i understood and was happy enough to wait as the food was ok and the coffee excellent but a few weeks later i got an email from groupon informing me that the oakland location would no longer be accepting the groupon  no longer  i visited several times including the day before this email and was informed every time that it would be accepted in the near futurebesides this awful customer service and false advertising they recently revoked their policy granting free refills on forhere coffee as found at all locations serving coffee tree roasters coffee  this combined with their ridiculously high prices for real food will make this an infrequent stop for this pittsburgher,0.0

in 10 years i think i have only written 2 or 3 reviews on yelp  a place has to either really really bad or really really good to make me want to write a review unfortunately this place is horrible  the meat was all the left over stuff that you might feed a dog all fat and parts of the chicken i couldnt even recognize  i could barely eat a couple of bites  i walked out of the place and threw it in the trash just outside  this place is in a touristy area so they probably get a lot of traffic probably have to pay very high rent and need to keep their costs low so they probably buy the cheapest ingredients  no matter how hungry you are please dont eat here,0.0

unfortunately the best way to describe the food here was bland was in town in june and stopped in based on the positive reviews unfortunately they did not live up to the actual food the wonton noodle soup was bland the broth was most likely water and had a couple of noodles and a piece of cabbage i had higher hopes for the pad thai and was met with equal disappointment the best part about thai cuisine is the flavor and heat that goes along with it the pad thai missed on both the chicken was so over cooked it was rubbery and there was no flavor to be had there,0.0

some people dont realize what it is like behind the scenes in the hospital i see people complaining about the empty ed waiting room and how they still have to wait hours to be seen you may be sitting there with your broken hand or with an upset stomach or itchy because of an allergen but what you dont know is that behind doors physicians and nurses are in the middle of saving the lives of people who need priority care people who will most likely die if not cared for first 20 physicians and nurses could be working on that 2 year old who stopped breathing after being pulled out from underwater as she fights to live or they could be caring for that family who were slammed into by a semi while hoping that the parents dont die so their children wont grow up as orphans some people may complain about how their physician is stuck up or how their nurse doesnt give them enough attention sure those behaviors are not acceptable but sometimes you need to be empathetic you are not the only patient the physician has to care for heshe may have over 50 patients theyre responsible for that day that nurse may be busy resuscitating that critical patient whose condition is tanking fast it is not easy being responsible for so many peoples lives my point is that banner university medical center is a great hospital with amazing physicians and nurses who work hard to develop their skills and knowledge the work that these health care providers and staff members do is all in the interest of providing excellent patient centered care i would highly recommend this hospital to anyone deciding which banner facility to go to,1.0

this is a pretty uncomfortable review for me to write because i really enjoy the winking lizard the kids enjoy going there and overall its a really solid and decent place to grab a bite and a beer however this night did nothing short of infuriate me and ill tell you why i arrived at the lizard with the kids while my wife is running about 10 minutes behind our server was very nice and relatively new by her own admission i ordered a black and tan which everybody knows is guinness mixed with another beer and that beer alternates regionally  the beer came out in an imperial pint glass as guinness shouldbut it was 23 full  23  i pointed this out to my relatively inexperienced to server but she stated oh you have to give it time to settle and it will filll right back up now ive been drinking guinness for quite some time and it never did quite fill up i ask the server to go and get the manager so he can correct the pour the manager on duty did show up and proceeded to tell me that because it was a black and tan they put it in an imperial glass although they do this so they do not have to wait for the head to settle now i am not saying the customer is always right but you do not serve a beer in a glass two thirds full  and then proceeded to argue with a customer in front of his kids by telling him he is wrong and the restaurant is right and theyre not going to change it  naturally this infuriated me and i asked the server to give me my bill as were going to get out  at this time the wife showed up and calmed me downbut now i cant enjoy a meal with an ahole know it  all manager whos only response to a complaint should have been ill fix that right away sirpiss off lizard  theres plenty of other choices of places to eat in mentor,0.0

great experience my husband needed a locksmith fast after his only key literally broke off in the lock and guests were supposed to be coming over within the hour he called desert locksmith and was quoted a 20 minute timeframe to arrive the owner ran arrived in only 10 minutes he was very friendly efficient professional and easy to work with he had the lock replaced in a matter of minutes and acted like it was no trouble at all he saved the day and we are very grateful i believe this company offers 24hour service calls so i highly recommend them the next time you need help and need it fast,1.0

the food is great but the service is pretty bad me my daughter and my friend came in today sat there for 10 minutes without any help i had to get up to get a menu and they still didnt acknowledge us finally i had enough and went up the waiter and asked if we were ever getting help because they sure ran up to the elderly couple that just came in when she came up to take our food order she gave horrible attitude and rushed us so i dont know if its because we are women of color i really hope thats not the case because then i will have a more formal complaint on the way it needs to get addressed because thats extremely poor customer service,0.0
i went to lunch with a coworker after i just got off of work she was going back but we had an hour of downtime we ordered our drinks and received those quickly our lady waitress asked if we needed more time and we said yes as it was our first time at keegans ten minutes later a waiter walked up and said he would be serving our table instead i asked for a refill then and we ordered our appetizer we didnt see our waiter again until he brought out our appetizer still no refill i had finished the appetizer and we were waiting to order i flagged our waiter down and asked for a refill again this time he went right to refill the drink once he returned we were able to order i asked for no onions on my burger with extra pickles to my dismay i received a burger with two pickle slices and plenty of onions at this point we were a bit rushed with eating because my coworkers lunch hour was nearly up i pulled the onions off and  didnt ask for more pickles one drink a pretzel burger and half appetizer totalled to 2200 the fries were delicious but the spinach artichoke dip came with broccoli and carrots which didnt make sense to me plate fillers i think i also came with salsa which was terrible the pretzel burger was tainted by the onions so it could have been better if done right overall experience felt cheap when the bill was quite pricey i would not recommend,0.0

my 5 sisters and i shared three rooms here and had the worst experience the hotel is remodeling and there was plastic sheeting everywhere very reminiscent of the shining the carpets were filthy and black water ran off our feet when we showered the shower in one of the rooms leaked into the room below and my sisters were told not to take any more shower until maintenance could take a look this was in the morning when we were trying to make it to a 900 event and only one sister had showered so she had to shower in my room making us run late and miss our event we got in late that night and found that my room hadnt even been cleaned the night clerk brought us clean towels but stated that he couldnt help us with our request for a free night because of all the trouble the next morning we were told that they could not give us a free night or even a discount because we had booked through expedia this was not true we booked through hotelscom and paid the hotel directly when we got there that morning my sisters were locked out of their room for about 12 an hour while maintenance tried to get the door open they finally did but this delayed my sisters from leaving on their 12hour car ride home i am completely disgusted that our stay was so bungled and they would not do anything to make it right stay at your own risk because they sure as heck dont care about having return customers,0.0
wow worst starbucks ive encountered and tbh ive never really encountered a bad one let alone a terrible oneapparently this is a starbucks but not actually a starbucks so rewards and refllls dont follow regular procedure nor is there any free wifi but what was the worst about that was that they were rude about it especially two of the tellers and when the manager explained that all starbucks do not give multiple refills he directed me to the website but since theres no free wifi he said he could print it out for me said he would be back in 10 minutes 25 minutes later still never returned and the staff had no idea where he had disappeared to or if he was coming back the website by the way says this free refills of hot or iced brewed coffee and tea you must use your registered starbucks card to purchase a beverage and then present that same starbucks card for refills of hot or iced brewed coffee or tea during the same store visit at participating starbucks stores httpwwwstarbuckscacardrewardsrewardsprogramtsandcsplease note the s in refills would that not indicate multiple never had a problem at any other location as long as its same store visit as indicated manager here also said it was within a certain time frame only and required a receipt only the shorter girl with black hair in a pony tail had any proper customer service etiquette,0.0

we live up the street from chagrin falls and were in the village about 23 times a week but somehow we never made it to flipside until the other day i never order burgers in restaurants but during our visit it felt wrong not to try the burgers i went with the flipside burger to truly get the real experience my daughter ordered a plain cheeseburger and my husband had the mikey burgerthis was the greatest cheeseburger ive ever eaten in my life it was juicy the flavors of the onions with the burger and the cheese and bacon were just phenomenal it was such a joy to eat i cant even put it into words that can do it justice i was reeling from how delicious this was  and while im no burger connoisseur i would take a flipside burger over any other burger in town including b spot sorry michael symonbeyond the amazing burgers the milkshakes were awesome and the mini corndogs were tasty we ate a lot of food lastly the service was impeccable we showed up on a busy lunch hour and we were surprised to get a table immediately our waitress who was also the person who sat us was incredibly accommodating even when we brought a newborn baby and a fouryearold with us she was extremely friendly and super fast the whole experience was fantastic all around,1.0

we absolutely love this little hole in the wall taco shop ive tried the carnitas al pastor chicken and carne asada the carne in my opinion is by far the best its got such a great flavor and the perfect crunchiness the also supply you with plenty of limes cucumbers spicy carrots and onion garnish as well as three different sauces you can add green red and a customizable hot sauce ie the more you stir it up the hotter it is i definitely suggest adding them all even the carrots and onions go great on or with the tacos the tortillas are incredible as well theyre fried just right and super fresh now for the cons the neighborhood is a little sketchy and parking can be difficult since theres only one row of parking between the businesses and 32nd st its definitely not fancy in any way but the food is fresh and done well,1.0

crooks bunch of crooks1 you order a dish but they dont even tell you that things like sweet potato fries are an extra and not part of a nocharge menu item2 drinks at the bar are charged at 350 for instance but if you order at the table its only 3 wtf i hate this place i understand the appeal of the big screens but it was not worth my moneythe food was also not that awesome sliders looked dry the tacos were disgusting and they charged extra for everything without telling you that the pork was 3 extra and so oni mean if you are going to lie about the items i could pay 3 for pork but not if you sneak it in there without telling me its an extra chargei also took the brisket sandwich and it was dry as hell disgustingeffing crooks never going back this reaffirms my hate for sports bars,0.0
great burger the queso burger was excellent and my wife claims that these are the best garlic fries shes ever had im not a garlic fry expert but that is pretty high praise from her the regular fries with ranch were very good i do have to say that my son did not enjoy his grilled cheese from the kids menu it was obviously a processed cheese i ate some it was actually pretty good i think the kid is just spoiled since we normally cook with some high grade cheeses kidsthe environment is very nice clean with good service the restrooms were clean all in all a very nice lunch thumbs up,1.0

this is my first thai restaurant in toronto but i think its setting the bar really high for others to beatthe khao soi is a yellow egg noodle in a creamy curry broth its very flavorful rich in coconut and hot curry its well balanced the coconut didnt over power the curry flavor it had a small teaspoonful of hot red chili oil on top make sure you mix it well with the noodle and broth it gives it the right amount of kick to the flavor its perfectionthe sukho thai pad thai is very authentic it has a sweet base flavor from the tamarind sauce its not sour like the common ketchupish pad thai youd get elsewhere sprinkle the roasted peanut on top to round out all the flavor dont skip it unless youre allergic to peanut we ordered chicken with it and we get generous amount of chunky tender chicken the chicken is slightly just a tad less juicy than id like but its by far the best chicken pad thai in gtaoh the green curry creamy oh so creamy coconutty green curry need i say more surprisingly the coconut bamboo shoot bell pepper and curry flavor are all well balanced individual flavor comes out progressively in my mouth and also burst out happily together  love it if i have a xxl stomach id have tried out all the curryi round out tonight with the thai ice tea and cassava cakein my humble opinion the chef put a lot of thought into the menu the choir on the menu is limited but each dish is prepared and crafted with love and sincerityif i were to nitpick a little bit they could improve a little bit at seating people and handling the line of people waiting for table all the people picking up takeout paying for takeout waiting for table and paying for the dinner are all on the same line this makes for quite a hectic dining experience for an otherwise perfecto dinner,1.0

i had to actually put my food down to write a review of this incredible place i thought i had exhausted the selection of nonpizza takeout in the brentwood area when yelp brought this lovely little gem to my attention set in a nondescript strip mall on route 51 just south of its intersection with brownsville road this place is easy to miss pause for a snackokay lets do this the service was great the people working there were so sweet and my food was on timefor my entree i ordered the tika masala chicken on the yelp ordering tool there are 4 spicy levels mild medium spicy and very spicy i chose very spicy and put a note to make it as spicy as it gets because i can handle it when they handed me my food it was accompanied by a small ramekin of red sauce the gentleman told me this was for extra spice if i wanted but that i should be careful because its really spicy the woman working the register agreed its hot she said to be honest at first i was skeptical of this i have been handed many a ramekin of mystery red sauce at many a restaurant and told many a time that it was the spicy sauce to end all spicy sauces ive been let down before but folks i say this to all my spicy food addicted friends this is it as soon as i got home i opened the ramekin of forbidden sauce and dipped my finger in it to try it because im a badass it tasted like hot pepper extract there is no salt in here its just the essence of the fires of hell distilled into perfection also my food was pretty darn spicy to begin with so its obvious im a spicy food fanatic and this place hit the spot but the quality of the food was also great the tika masala was delicious and tasted homemade it wasnt just spicy and nothing else it had a great depth of flavor and noticeable notes of various spices that i embarrasingly cant identify i could tell the chicken was fresh the dish came with rice but i ordered a side of naan too they obviously make this inhouse as well it was really goodi also ordered a starter of the steamed vegetable mo mo and i love that as well these are delicious plane or with the interesting spicy sauce they come with i have been snacking on them while i write this review you get 10 of them for 799 which brings me to my last thingeverest is really reasonably priced i got all my food including my extra side of naan for under 20 most entrees are about 10 i will definitely be back get yourself there you wont regret it,1.0
we like to try local eateries we often avoid chains to support our small business owners the food here seems interesting but falls short every thing was bland and lacking a wow factor a kicker for us was a server dropped several plates and glasses accidents happen but when the glass shatters into my 6 yr old girls hair shoes and lap i expect a sincere apology not oopsa sweep upnever to be heard from again foodmediocreservicehuge fail never even asked if she was ok other guests were more concerned we wont come back,0.0

the male performers were beyond excellent sadly the staff was not the female employees were downright rude obnoxious and unprofessional their discourteous disrespectful behavior was bewilderingly shocking especially considering the fact that we were a party of 16 women who had each paid 75 to be there i would recommend firing the female staff or taking your bridal parties elsewhere it was a shockingly rude hostile disappointing experience and frankly an utter waste of money given the despicable manner in which we were treated by female staff the male performers in contrast were beyond fabulous and i would give them 10 stars were it not for the abhorrent manner in which we were treated by the female staff,0.0

loved the food and the ambiance of this restaurant from the outside it doesnt look like much but the inside was really cozy and although casual the decor was appropriate for a nice sit down dinner i base my ratings for vietnamese cuisine according to their grilled chicken and rice or vermicelli so i ordered the grilled chicken with rice and added an egg with an additional charge my friend got the pad thai the service was a bit slow and the food took a bit longer than other viet restaurants ive been to but considering the fully occupied restaurant i understood the server was friendly neverthelessthe portion sizes were good and the chicken was excellentnot too greasy as ive experienced in the past my dish was also served with a side of pho broth which according to the server was to be eaten with the rice this was something that has never been served at other restaurants that i have been to although i still do prefer the flavour of the lemongrass grilled chicken from pho mi 99 at latimer this chicken had a different seasoning which was good too for a change the pad thai was also really enjoyed by the time we were done with dinner the waiting line for a table had significantly increased which goes to show its popularity i really enjoyed this place and will definitely return,1.0

while visiting the strip district a few weeks ago i stopped in for lunch at gaucho on a whim it turned out to be the best decision i made that day its a small place it can hold 1012 people max and its easy to miss if youre walking bythe first thing you notice when you walk in is the aroma from the grill your mouth is already watering before you sit down i ordered the carne sandwich with ribeye which comes topped with grilled peppers  onions and chimmichurri sauce the meat was well seasoned and cooked perfectly  juicy and tender with a really nice char i washed it down with a cold mexican coke its not the cheapest sandwich youll find ringing in at 12 but its more than worth it i came in hungry and left fullbesides the food itself what really made my visit great was the excellent service the owner of the place was super friendly and very patient explaining the various items on the menu they also did all the little things that take customer service from just good to exceptional for example one customer walked in and placed a 150 order to go gaucho gives a 10 discount if you call ahead with your takeout order pro tip but they went ahead gave him the discount anyway and helped him walk his  order out to his car in the snowy conditions that is how you do customer service,1.0

i have been consistenly buying in bulk their carrier and essential oils butters and waxes and as other reviewers have mentioned their labels are misleading and there are no clear expiration dates for products that have a lot number and the ones that dont how do they keep an inventory of their old and new products if some dont even have a lot number we were told some of the oils i purchased have a shelf life of 2 years and when i reached out to another rep they said it will expire in less than 6 months we were also told they cannot provide expiration dates because their suppliers dont provide this informationwe even reached out to the management and they never followed up like they promised went by the name karen way too much digging and still more confusion and frustration if you are a skincare and cosmetic company looking to find a good hasselfree vendor this company should not be on your list unless you want to work with something you dont even know when it will go badrancid for your customers,0.0

it has been quite some time since i have written a one star review but i was so inclined on this particular occasion that i ended up using google street view to find and add this business to yelp ill keep it short and sweet as almost everyone knows what subway is about we arrived at this location quite starved but were really put off by the state of affairs first of all our first 3 choices of subs were simply not available once we settled for cold cuts we were told that we didnt really have much choice as far as the bread or toppings either i always find it a funny business model to run a restaurant with half the menu items missing what really got ticked off was how we saw a chicken breast sandwich made without the chicken being warmed up its true that the meat is cooked but theres no way thats safe there were other unorthodox tidbits but i think this will suffice overall walk a little further north to the 24hr mcd right up the street it will seem like fine cuisine in comparison,0.0
our first time to itsy bitsy and it was a fabulous experience ambiance was equally as hip and appealing as their other properties park and commonwealth greeted by a friendly hostess followed by great service by our server alexa alexa was extremely knowledgable of all specialty drinksbeers and immediately recommended sake bombs which was a great time we ordered the potstickers garlic chile edamame skewers and corn for appetizers and tonkatsu ramen for our entree the cookies and cream mochi was the perfect way to end our dinner great atmosphere staff and food we will be back soon ,1.0
this place is clear reviewed very well we went with high expectations and we were not disappointed you will wait in a very very long line but we felt it was worth it the al pastor tacos are so delicious the meat is flavored super well after 45 minutes in line to get our tacos we almost waited again for more,1.0

was wanting to have chinese take out for lunch but all the places were too busy i really craved vietnamese and didnt want to go to my usual spot because i didnt want to drive all that way when lo and behold the submarine  all i read on the signage was vietnamese pho and vermicelliwinner  didnt know what to expect and it blew me away  this is my first review but i had to write one because its so lovingly made by a mom and pop shop  i ordered quite a bit of food and bubble tea and everything was so fresh and seriously well done  now it did take a while for my large order but the owner did say it would take longer  i have to say well worth the wait and she gave me a hug after she packaged my meal oh the subs are perfect with a hint of spice caramelized onions savoury cilantro  the bun vermecelli was excellent as i ordered 1 of each meat for my family to try and they all were super tasty  such a great find and so close to my homewow,1.0

i am writing this review just a few minutes after checking in upon check in we were informed that that we needed a credit card which i understood what i found strange was that not only  did they need to charge your card for the room even if you were planning on paying cash but they also needed to charge the card for an additional 200 when i explained that this seemed unusual to me jit tanna the general manager implied that i wasnt used to staying in hotels as nice as his he went on to say that the rooms are worth 100000 and they needed to secure the room i explained to him that i understood the need to secure the but usually having a credit card on file would suffice he said this was the policy everywhere i also told him that when i made the reservation nowhere did it say that there would be a 200 hold on the card to this he replied that they didnt have to inform you of the 200 hold at the time you make a reservation my response was its not ok for a business to be deceitful and to have hidden fees or charges jit tanna insisted that it wasnt hidden i said how could it not be hidden when you just admitted that you dont have to tell you about needing to charge a 200 security deposit up front this conversation took place at 230 am so we wound up paying so we wouldnt be trying  to find a room at such a late hour as we got off of the elevator we saw bare walls bare like no paint or wallpaper there were joint compound patches all over i dont think you can claim something is worth100000 if it isnt complete  and as for the 100000 room it left a lot to desired like square footage i will never stay here again and i would suggest that you wouldnt either,0.0

i needed to find a special place to board my two dogs for a week i have never boarded them before always hiring a pet sitter to stay overnight at my house but due to my house sale closing while on vacation that wasnt an option this time  one of my dogs is rather high needs has severe separation anxiety and will go into seizures when stressed or kenneled so to say i was extremely stressed about this is an epic understatement  we stopped by a few days before i had to leave both dogs seemed happy and the staff was confident they would do well in boarding  drop off day came and it was like taking my kids to kindergarten all over again  fast forward a week i go to pick them up and my high needs dog blows out all happy and races over to visit with another pair or dogs waiting to come in to doggy daycare torn between being insulted that he didnt care about my arrival and relieved he wasnt stressed out,0.0

delightfully tasty i was incredibly surprised by this restaurant it blends in with with the myriad number of other korean restaurants in the area and doesnt look special at first glance decided to give it a try as i was recommended by a friend couldnt have been happier to discover this place buk chang dong has opened my eyes to korean food and soon tofu their dishes are exceptionally delicious every bite bursting with taste the food can be nice and spicy if you ask but unlike many other restaurants spice here mean actual flavour and not just heat they throw in to make it spicy service is awesome super friendly and fast prices are also incredible id recommend the bulgogi beef plate 9 and the kimchi soon tofu  3 i think i wouldnt recommend the bibimbap not because its not tasty but because the other soon tofu dishes are less mainstream and incredibly satisfying must try,1.0

when i bought my older home it needed a great deal of updating as everything was still original tackling remodeling projects can be incredibly trying our garage and laundry room was among the ugly areas that needed some help and we were really hoping it was another project we werent going to have to try to take on ourselves we wanted a complete overhaul but after pricing some competitors were beginning to think we might have to settle on our wish listwe contacted space solutions to explore our options and were immediately put in touch with the salesman for our area he promptly returned our call and came to provide us with a free in home estimate paul was our salesman and he was incredibly helpful and professional he took all of our wish list items and found a way to deliver them and then some at a great price the pricing was so competitive that we ended up with twice the cabinets in the garage that we had hoped for a work bench that my hubby loves an added pegboard for more organization of items we were going to need more regularly great upper cabinets for our laundry room and we were able to have our garage floor coated too after clearing out our garage the garage floor was done one day and that immediately made things look so much better our cabinet installation was started within a day or two so that the garage floor was fully dried our cabinet installers were amazing and we were surprised how quickly they worked to complete our project they made it look so easy probably because they really are pros at what they dowe love our garage and laundry room now they look like something out of a magazine and are the envy of our culdesac so much that our neighbors decided to have some work done too  my hubby loves his man cave we havent had any issues with the work that was performed next up contacting them for closets inside our home we cant wait,1.0

great place i bought my xdm here at a reasonable price later on i bought my xds what i love about coming here is that these people are knowledgeable and do not pressure you into purchasing anything they help you find exactly what your looking for great place to look around with out pressure and they have great deals also they have  raffle tickets for a free gun how can you beat that and for the negative comments about limited stocked items prices on ammo  and over priced weapons is wrong keep in mind that its a business and everyone has to make a profit but this place has reasonable prices for new not used im definitely going back for my next purchase,1.0

this place used to be pretty good now no matter what you order it seems really oily the pork egg rolls seriously have no pork in them lol we order here a lot and the egg rolls have been like this every time so its not like it was a mistake just once and the girl answering the phone is pretty mean and when you pick up your food she isnt much better were giving you our business so why are you so rude,0.0
i shouldve read the reviews this is disgusting ordered the katsu saimin the katsu was hard over fried over breaded and had hardly any actual chicken it was mostly breading the saimin had no flavor just noodles and a weak broth i feel like i couldve made a pack of ramen noodles and it wouldve been better than this not to mention the signs that say that you can only get one refill and that you can only get rice and mac win combo meals i should have taken that as an omen that this place is not somewhere i want to be never again do yourself a favor and go to aloha kitchen this ll is gross,0.0
my fianc have lived in pittsburgh for about a year and a half and this was by far the worst food and service weve had living here we had high hopes for the fresh oysters when they arrived they were served in little plastic dixie cup shooters and were flavorless and gelatinousmy fianc did like her fish sandwhich but when she told the server she gave her regular pepsi instead of diet our server rolled her eyes and stormed offi do not recommend this restaurant please support good food and service in pittsburgh elsewhere,0.0
its a party in here arriving at 6pm because our first choice had a line out the door we were seated promptly upon arrival tables were full with several birthday parties but we were seated at the bar which was nice since it was much easier to hear each other over the yelling from many many sake bombs and loud music started the evening with drinks the beer mojito peaked my interest most and i thought it was okay they may have muddled the mint a little too much since it gave a bitter aftertaste but otherwise a nice little concoction there my friend got the nama grapefruit sour its intriguing that you get to juice your own grapefruit but at least you know its fresh juice and youre free to moderate how much juice to add for food we got a few things to share zuke maguro special menu item unagi bibimbap tebasaki salmon tataki and hojicha pudding most of the dishes were on the sweeter side but most likely modified to match the canadian palate patrons of this establishment were mixed but definitely the party type music was bumping many birthdays were celebrated and they do sake bombs in buckets yeahbuckets lot of yelling words of encouragement and cheering was involved but quite a lively atmosphereas we finished up kinka drew quite the crowd with a full house inside and on the patio deck i suggest making a reservation if you can and if you want to party it up the sake bombs are such a show,1.0

this is probably one of my favourite cantonese restaurants in toronto the dim sum is much better than what you get in downtown toronto or down the street perfect chinese restaurant given that its not as cheap of the perfect chinese restaurant the taste and freshest is miles better here during the weekday dinner service is a bit empty but the seafood is always fresh the restaurant is clean and really spacious with high ceilings and a relatively modern interioras for mall dragon centre its definitely changed from being one of the busiest chinese malls in scarborough during its high time when it was one of the first chinese malls to being pretty run down and back to getting its charm again the area is being in the process of being developed to a office complex  so id recommend stopping soon before things start rolling with development its a family run place which i like because it means the owner is pretty hands on you wont miss him looking after the food some of my favourite dishes are the hong kong style lobster the roast chicken with sticky rice and the mango sticky balls with whipped cream and fruit stuffing,1.0
mike was professional direct and honest about our homes position in the market we considered it a unique property and persistent in getting it sold we especially appreciated his weekly updates and constant attention to assessing our options and making adjustments to keep the listing active and getting attention working with michelle was also a pleasure she made sure we were kept informed and handled all of the details seamlessly we recommend them highly,1.0

i heard good word about this place so i decided to try it myself needless to say i was extremely pleased by banjara the flavour and quality of their food the friendly service  the unique seating arrangmentit had it all its also not too out of the way as it is located  within a 5 min walk from christie subway stationi sat in their full windowed seating area wherw i was given a complimentary basket of chipcracker things i have no idea what theyre called  but i attached a picture and can assure you they were veeerryyy tasty i went with the chicken tikka masala my brother and dad ordered the chicken vindaloo and the vutter chicken platter respectively we also ordered a side of garlic rice and plain naaneverything was delicious average sized portions and even a little cheaper in price than standard indian restaurants charge nothing was too spicy or chewy zero negativity  the plain naan was perfect for all the sauce included in tue main meat diah although the platter certainly offered more variety i would recommend that if you know what main dish you enjoy like chicken tikka masala in my case have an order of that and get either a side of rice or naan to conpliment the main dish only thing i wasnt crazy about was their rice pudding included in the platter i simply found it very sweet but i can see how others may enjoy it  i will most certainly return to banjara and if youre ever craving indian cuisine  this is the place to come,1.0

my mother was admitted to the new hospital wing at rv for awhile this springtime and i was so impressed in the care and attention she got at this new facility  she was taken into non emergency and we didnt wait very long until she was finally moved to an area which was private and it only took her one day to get her admitted into her own room  while in emergency however you are enclosed in a curtained area and even though you had some sort of privacy you are able to hear the conversations of the hospital staff  this was quite a humorous thing for me as private things were disclosed in staff dialogue and my mother and i could hear everything very loud and clear  staff would enter my mothers area perform their professional duties leave and continue their conversations on the so and so relationship of this doctor with this nurse what happened the weekend before etc  i couldnt help but feel like i was in the cast of greys anatomyso let me get to the rooms at rv wow her room was fantastic it was a huge private room with huge windows overlooking the rocky mountains  the nurses attendants and the doctors there were friendly attentive and extremely caring my mother had the best care and was so well taken care of a team of specialists then spoke with me personally at another meeting and we all discussed the best possible options for my mother in terms of the future steps that needed to happen to ensure her safety and well being5 stars rocky view,1.0

pretty disappointed in this pizza hut location first i should have just picked it up considering it is two blocks away from my house and there must have been a huge delivery charge due to the fact that one stuffed crust pizza with 1 12 toppings and one small order of wings was 28 anyway we asked for the pizza to be uncut and par baked so that we could bake it to our liking once it arrived an hour and a half later but they couldnt even do that for us because it came almost fully baked and cut now how are we supposed to put it in the oven also they failed to give us our blue cheese dressing for our wings also this is monday at 11am when they opened so im not sure how it took that long to prepare especially since they werent even supposed to cook it all the way shitty,0.0
i should have read some of the bad reviews first before going to that place for lunch the service was ok although the waitress forgot to bring out the soup that came with our meal she rectified that later when our main dishes were already out my husband ordered mongolian beef which was good i ordered sweet and sour chicken what i got was kungpaoish chicken we also ordered a roll since it was half off sakana makes the same roll way better my chicken tasted ok however 4 hours later i had food poisoning it definitely was my chicken that i had for lunch since i had not eaten anything else i will not return and strongly advise against going to this place,0.0
saturday morning we got a late start but came up this way on a recommendation from love this spot is located in a very fun area in the strip district where theres old warehouses fun shops and open air markets so as a fan of all three i was in heaven we came up this way and at first struggled with parking and a decent traffic flow but managed to snag a spot and do some walking upon walking in we were greeted and explained how things work order up front and scoop a table decor is very barn style and colorful with different chairs looks of wood etc they serve breakfast all day which is a huge plus for me personally i could eat breakfast all year however from looking at the menu they all have salads and sandwiches and plenty to choose from not to mention homemade scones cookies and pastries up front as well man man manwe ordered some breakfast and coffee and tea respectively and took our seat and hung out planning your day over coffee while waiting for breakfast is low key my favorite activity on a saturday so this hit the spot food was incredible i went with the omelette with bacon cheese and spinach it was quite possibly the largest thiccest fluffiest omelette i have had also was served with home fries which i didnt see on menu another added plus home fries had a nice flavor and kick to them and condiments are available on the table coffee was good as well though i wouldve liked to have more options on dressing it besides just room temp half and half great spot i love it and you and i will be back,1.0

i usually dont write reviews despite having gone to quite a few restaurants but ive had a consistently good experience here for a 10 meal the quality quantity service and setting cant get much better ive tried the noodles with bone soup the beef soup the peanut dandan soup and the szechuan soup and they dont cheat to make it taste good with fat and salt the portion size is outrageous and the meat quality is quite good too dont get turned off by their new menu design which will remind you more of poor quality all you can eat hotpots in chinatown it seems the chinese way is to showcase as much variety as possible but in this case the variety is all good so far i would give it a 45 stars as the appetizers are a bit underwhelming in comparison and there is no liquor license but otherwise this is a pretty authentic chinese noodle soup experience if you get tired of the ramen and pho around town no comment on the rice pancake or fish options yet after settling your bill there is an additional option to spin a prize wheel and weve won 55 times one of which was a free meal where they handed back the full 10 in cash just ridiculous ill definitely be coming back and am writing this review as i fear they dont get enough customers and wont be open for very long it used to be called noodle face but is called fish noodle now however it is essentially  the same restaurant i believe having read the other reviews perhaps its changed owners again so could be worth a second try for those who had bad experiences before,1.0

travis treated us like royalty from the start to the end of our family dinner for four he made terrific recommendations and even let us sample some of the sides so we could make just the right choice with our meals the brisket was delectable the steak tender and tasty the ribs were moist and meaty we simply loved the cornbread and the q rolls travis kept our drinks freshened but never hovered or made us feel uncomfortable as we enjoyed our meal and family celebration we are already planning our next visit and plan to ask for travis by name,1.0
i absolutely love this place having the option for chinese and sushi on the same menu saves me so much hassle when i have guests who dont do sushi when im craving it their lo mein dishes somehow magically double in size when you open the container and their crab rangoon is the best ive had other favorites are the hot and sour soup and they have a really great ginger dressing for their salads which is hard to find the star for me is the sashimi though thick cuts of incredibly fresh fish cut with expertise is reason enough to keep coming back especially given their lunch specials the staff is fantastic and always remembers me i highly recommend it,1.0

one star is being kind not only was i dissatisfied with the effort that was put in to clean my home  barely dusted lightly mopped grime was still on stove disgusting grime left under my toilets etc etc when i complained i got a manager calling me back and telling me that even though i paid the 110 for the full size and square footage of my house that they were not required to clean one whole bedroom and one whole bathroom it was completely ignored and not even touched they never even entered the room or bathroom 110 was the service fee and i tipped  30 obviously before i saw what a crappy job they did and they still cannot come out and clean this part of the house that they missed instead she argued with me that it wasnt included in the square footage of my house even though with the same service it was always cleaned it before the reason why i pay a hefty  service fee is to clean all of my bedrooms and bathrooms the manager then argued with me the reason as to why they didnt clean very well is because they were here for their full allotted three hours who knows what they were doing those three hours but they definitely were not cleaning the whole time a cleaning job should not go by time as  it will just let them be lazy and work less since they know they have to leave in three hours anyways it should go by how well the house is cleaned steer clear of this service  they suck not only are the maids lazy but the management is not what it should be very unprofessional to argue with the customerextremely extremely dissatisfied oh i forgot the yard service that is provided with the fee was just as bad the guy came out and blew around a few leaves actually making more of a mess left weeds and was in and out in five minutes so ridiculous,0.0

honestly i might go broke if i lived within the general vicinity of this mecca of grocery stores this is the creme de le creme of frys hands down the best single grocery store in all of metro phoenixwhat to doway too much first you can shop for pretty much any specific grocery need you can think of they have a coldstone insideyes coldstone they have a coffee shop a car rental counter a valet they also have a cigarwine bar which specializes in wine flightsand a top flight sushi station gasps for breaththe goodoh there is so much good this place is stocked to the gills with extras that we can only dream of at other locations their specialty bread area with artisan breads is surprising the wine bar looks nice although i havent personally tried it myself its hard to explain this spot other than it is a frys on steroids the food is a bit nicer and each aisle or section has different higher end items that you just dont see elsewhere this is frys answer to whole foods and sprouts yet at a costco size level you simply must go like nike just do itthe badwell if you need a scooter your battery might run out trying to see everything im sorry about that god that was my bad if you loathe walking in other words then do not go here all joking aside the only negative i see is the location it serious just plays directly to its clientele upper class scottsdalians or we you call them haha people like myself in central phoenix and he surrounding cities are left in the dust and its completely out of the question thinking about driving to shop here ha ha no way thats my biggest issue just simply the fact that they placed this so far away from the other cities mehthe down lowdespite the location issue this place is too great to lose even a half a star there is too much good stuff  5 stars for the typical good service large selection additional neverbeforeseen amenities and the comparability of service to that of higherend grocery chains this place steps its game way up scottsdale you are lucky,1.0

we got to visit this restaurant while we were in montreal the location was easy to find and luckily we were able to find parking as well its located on a small street which doesnt have much parking near by the restaurant does require reservations for large groups we had about 6 people with us as we walked in not knowing about reservations we asked to be seated the manager had told us he would have to see if we can be seated at this point we were a little disappointed but he came back with good news and seated us at a table the menus were designed in a old fashion which made the restaurant unique the food was delicious and had just the right amount of spice as a person from a indian background i was pleased with the food the restaurant was clean and well maintained i will definitely be going back when im in montreal,1.0
this is seriously the worst experience i have ever had at a spai bought the travelzoo deal which includes a facial a massage and a smoothieupon my arrival i was greeted by one of the receptionist i was notified that i will need to take out the smoothie as they will be closing once my massage is done i wish i was notified that when i made the appointment so i can come in earlier to use the facilitiesi was brought to the women lockers room and there was literally 15 people in a tiny room the receptionist look through every single locker and realize they were all empty so she ran out to get me new towels and bath robes the impression i got is that they are not ready for my arrival at allmoving onto the massage and facial it was decent but the lady barely speaks english after i finished the treatments she tried to sell me their facial products i didnt even know what was applied to my face at that point  zero interest in buying their productsoverall nothing comparable to any 5 hotels spa that i have been to i felt even more stressed out after my treatment loldont go,0.0

actual rating 45 venue and cocktails bump up the ratingfor a saturday evening the no1dp and i wanted to do a dinner and show date vegas style for us this meant either fine dining or upscale casual with a named chef he already booked the show way in advance and left me in charge of planning dinner as the show we were going to was a fun show in new yorknew york i didnt want to go anywhere too extravagant venue1 chef rick moonen is well known for his seafood restaurant rm seafood in the lower level this is his take on comfort food in large and small plates made to be shared2 restaurant is decorated in victorian period steampunkstyle prominent features are that the women are dressed in bustiers which the no1dp noted to be different for each waitress this was confirmed letting the waitress express herself while conforming to dress code furniture pieces were appropriate to the time sofa was comfy3 a cocktail program managed by the talented eric smith who kinda looks like the current doctor with glassesservice staff took care of us waiters attended to us bussers served our food and i had a little chat with eric himself drinks cocktail menu is served on an ipad no1dp noticed that you can email your orders i hope he used this feature for the wines as i am having a total brain fart for not remembering the exact wines we had i tend to do this for restaurants with notable cocktail menus as i tend to pay attention to the cocktails more no1dp got the smoked whiskey and cola 15 the whiskey is smoked to order with cherrywood chips the cola is a housemade concoction with various spices as to not make the coke too sweet and enhance the smokiness of the whiskey no1dp never had anything like this before and enjoyed his drinki got the mario took the wrong pipe 14 i actually had a talk with eric about this particular drink caipirinhas are one of my most favorite cocktails and i was impressed on his method of using cachaa  mixing it with curaao egg whites and extra virgin olive oil to make the drink a lot more smooth than the caipirinha and still have that burst of citrus each sip finally cachaa is used in a cocktail other than a caipirinhafor our dishes no1dp got an oaked chardonnay and i got a cabernet wine parings were sufficient the tannins went well with our quite savory dishes foodrx fish tacos in taro root shells 12 the kampachi is done as a ceviche and the taco shell is delicate enough that the taco could fall apart midbite and the fish flavors and textures can shine throughlamb osso bucco greek style 28 ive had veal osso bucco in the traditional italian style and i like this interpretation better the lamb is braised so that the meat is tender and falls off the bone the meat is covered in its own juices and the orzo soaks these juices nicely there were two pieces of lamb cut perfectly for sharing lobster bolognaise 38 pasta was perciatelli lobster and pasta were also prepared to be shared i could still taste the lobster even with the bolognaise sauce no1dp notes that the pasta was just a tad too chewymoonen tater tots 9 big tater tots that were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside potatoes were not greasy decent but might pick another side next timecookies  milk 9 made to order chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies milk poured nicely as it had a higher cream content outside was crisp so cookie didnt fall apart but center was moist and chewy cookies were rich yet lost some of its richness and moistness the next daythe no1dp and i had such a great time that we ended up being a little late to our show we noticed that the restaurant was empty for a saturday night and hope that this restaurant will still exist the following year the cocktails bridge the gap between the comfort food and the victorian steampunk theme while the cocktails can survive without the restaurant the restaurant cannot survive without the cocktails if the restaurant does close i hope that erics cocktails can survive in some other form,1.0

ive held off on this review for quite a while but after strike 3 here i felt compelled to finally write my review im sure this might be hit or miss but at least this experience has repeated itselfthe concept of the build your burger and of course the hubert endorsement is a reason that fills the seat but my love for the burger bar unfortunately stops therei have gone on 3 separate occasions and the first 2 i have had issues with the burger and recently it was now my wife who had the irish luck with lunchthe first two times i had the build your burger and both times they had come out raw vs the medium that was requested i normally am not a complainer when i eat but for something like that getting sick is not my forterecently i went and this time it was my wifes burger that was red and dripping blood which was inexcusable she ordered sliders and she even said it best how can you undercook a small pattybeyond those experiences i feel the overall flavor of the burger itself is just not there i was looking for a little kick or at least something that doesnt leave me looking for a soda or a dolled up milk shake im now on the hunt for a new burger establishment to satisfy my requests,0.0

a few months ago my son and i went to this location and enjoyed a marvelous experience with great food and a brilliantly wonderful waitress that i left a 50 tip  believe me she was amazing  this time we were so excited as it would be our second visit and let me tell you i left the waitress a 0 tip  this is something i never did before  after we put our order in we noticed people coming in after us getting their food paying and leaving  i kept looking for our waitress while trying to keep my son entertained but she forgot we were even there  then she came and told us that the kitchen was backed up  yes she lied  if she had been honest and said she forgot to place the order i would have understood as we all make mistakes  she chose to lie when we had eyes to see others eating  then we waited even longer  like really long considering i got a very simple salad and my son got the fajitas  nothing that should take so long  well it was my sons first experience with fajitas and i explained to him how they come out sizzling in the pan and the smell is incredible  luckily the table next to us which came in 30 minutes after we placed our order had also ordered the fajitas and my son was able to experience that excitement vicariously  it would still be 45 minutes before his showed up  no sizzle no smell and a bit on the cooled off side  my salad was soggy from sitting around so long and drizzled in queso fresco which i asked to be left off because im vegan  oh and thanks for the burnt flatbread that just made it all so much better  and im talking about the bottom and edges being charcoal black and disintegrated  trying to get her back again after she threw our plates in front of us and ran off was ridiculous  there was no point because she was done  so she forgot to place our order forgot to pick it up when it came out ignored us until another worker twice sent her to our table lied to us didnt offer a dessert or a drink refill for myself  thankfully she did refill my sons lemonade while looking me in the eye and lying about the kitchen staff  the vast contrast of service we received during those two visits was off the charts  therefore lady your tip is backed up  look for it in the mail,0.0

was meaning to check out this ramen shop in my neighborhood because we usually go downtown for our noodle fix looking at the photos and reading some great reviews i was very excited and obviously had high expectations however touhenboku disappointed me we ordered gyoza as an appetizer i would skip these when they came to the table they looked delicious after one bite all i could taste was water the meat filling was quite bland as well theyre frozen and just microwaved so the texture was rubbery as my main i ordered the ramen  donburi set the garlic flavored ramen with thick noodles was meh for me the menu raved about the strong garlic flavor and how its a touhenboku classic im a huge fan of garlic and found my ramen to be underwhelming for the donburi i ordered the chicken karaage bowl it was bland tasting fried chicken drenched with mayonnaise over plain rice all in all the one word that describes the food here  b l a n dwe went for a lateish saturday lunch at around one oclock the restaurant was not too packed there were maybe 2 or 3 other patrons so the staffpatron ratio was definitely in our favor anyway the service was terrible it was quite slow to begin with once finished our meals we waited for our server to return because i wanted to order the mille feuille i said excuse me to one server she saw me and just walked off thats rude i thought but i gave this person the benefit of the doubt another server passed by my table and again i said excuse me he saw me as our eyes met but he too just walked off finally another server came by after about an additional 10 minutes of waiting in this time we managed to stack all our plates and place them on the side of the table the restaurant is quite small so its not like we were hidden in a cornerthe food was meh and the service was so bad that i dont think theres a reason for me to return,0.0

very unprofessional weird vibes in office i scheduled an appointment in the early afternoon and also took 2 hours off of work to go see the dentist i had never seen dr sams before and i couldnt find any reviews but his practice is close to my job first of all his practice is more like a shack on ellsworth ave i had driven and walked by it many times and i never would have guessed it was a business unless i saw there was a faded sign on it when i got inside it was dark and dr sams was standing behind the front desk window i told him i had an appointment at 1 and since i was a new patient i figured i had forms to fill out so i got there about 15 minutes early he began mumbling and what i gathered was that there was a problem and he couldnt see me he also said he tried to call me but i didnt have any missed calls or messages he then said that his air conditioning wasnt working and that was the problem he sort of asked if we could reschedule but wasnt very direct i politely declined maybe hes a great dentist but hes certainly very inconsiderate of his patients time and his office lacks a friendly atmosphere,0.0

long overdue review  this place would get 3 stars without serving anything  a rather dark corner of my neighborhood has been transformed into a bright gathering place by the energy of this friendly energetic young couple  its a testament to their efforts that i see crowds gather at an ice cream shop in the cold grey depth of the cleveland winterthe actual product pushes masons over the top  grocery store grade ice creams beat you over the head with sweetness and flavorings  even some premium brands are rather intense  this is the place to go if you want a true flavor experience  after savoring pints of the rising star coffee and salted caramel the thing that stands out most is the subtlety  this is a premium product that caresses the taste buds with enticing subtle hints of the featured ingredients on top of a solid base that is not cloyingly sweetnot cheap but the ice cream equivalent of a meal prepared by a master chef,1.0

my boyfriend and i decided on this location and restaurant because hed never been there before and claims he doesnt like italian food pah so i picked this place to change his mind my mom and i had lunch here a month before and it was delicious then not so much this timeit was valentines day so we expected a wait we arent unreasonable an hour and a half passed and people were seated that came in after us before the hostess noticed we had been there a while somehow we were overlooked  but whatever im starving and happy to be sat we were seated in a booth by the bar and didnt have a waitress proper we had the super busy bartender who had little enough time to make drinks much less remember we needed drinks or silverware or ya know any attention at all  again cant blame her its valentines day crazy busy they likely had callouts or something30 minutes later our order gets put in 30 minutes later our appetizer comes out red flag should have been when i heard them 86 the mozzarella app we got she brought out the appetizer and just didnt mention how there was no mozz i guess she figured we were new and didnt know any better it was just this ricotta ish cheese and no mozz okay so the app was meh main entrees yay an hour after putting the order in  dying of hunger lol he ordered a pork dish and i had lobster ravioli his wouldve been great but it was barely warm and tasted like it died in the window my ravioli 5 dont order this if youre hungry werent even turned upright which yknow whatever but what disappointed me is that it looked like they had dumped it off the tray they microwaved it in and it tasted so microwaved mine wasnt hot either but i scarfed it down anyway definitely the worst meal and biggest waste of time i can say ive spent at a restaurant in a long time,0.0

ok everyone knows the bread at this place is the shiznit  i know it and its the reason why i keep coming back  howevertoday i met up with my sister for lunch here and i should have taken the way the employee treated us when i ordered our food as a sign to get the fuck outta there  she was giving us a dirty look but i ignored it because shit we all have bad days and thats what i thought she hadwe find a seat get our drinks andwait  10 minutes20 minutes30 minutes  all of you mother fuckers whove been here know they dont take 30 minutes to get you your foodmaybe 5 minutes at most  so anyway a sandwich maker walked out and asked us if we got our food yet and i was like yeah  obviously since we still have the number on our table  she immediately brings us two slices of cake on the house  ok thats nice but i want my fucking food and im on my lunch break hello  we get our food and my sandwich wasnt what i ordered  she said ok ill go make the right sandwich but you can keep this one  i told her i dont care at this point i just want to eat  while we eat we notice we didnt get our sides  on top of that we didnt get utensils and they always give that to you when they bring the food  so my sandwich was brought out finally by the manager on duty im assuming since he wore a different shirt  i asked him is there a reason why it took 30 minutes to get our food  he looked shocked and went im assuming to find out  he never came back to our table to tell me  at this point im like i need to get back to work  so i went to the register and asked the employee for a refund for the stupid sides we didnt get  she was like you didnt get your sides  whaat  im thinking calm down bitch just give me the fucking refund so i can get the fuck outta here  she said the manager has to approve it  perfect   he gets there asks me what the problem is  im looking at him like are you fucking crazy  i asked you earlier why it took 30 minutes to get our food and you went and hid  so i told him i need a refund for the two sides we didnt get  he gives me the refund and some rice crispy treats and said sorry  his excuse was weve had a bad day its just been crazy  really dude  is that really your pathetic excuse for an answer  i dont give a fuck if youre busy what kind of system do you have where you forget to bring food to a table especially when we have been sitting there with a number visible to all the employees who are bringing food to everyone else   ugh anyway yeah first time ive ever experienced haters at this place and here in bootsy ass charlotte  it was obvious the workers didnt like us right when we walked in  yeah we arent black or white like the majority of the people in this city but daaamn we arent animals  backward ass city  and whats sad is the doormat of a manager couldnt do anything about it  he didnt have the balls to go find out why it took 30 minutes to bring our food and come tell me  respect asshole show somelove the bread disappointed in the staff,0.0

bette midler still has it she did her shtick cracked a few jokes and sang all of her good songs i really enjoyed the showgirls  from the dancing to the costumes  really made the show i do have to say that the mermaid routine in the middle was a little huh but again the costumes were divine it is definitely an adult show and it was amusing watching the reactions of some of the older guys sitting around us the show was an hour and a half with no intermission we were in the 1st mezzanine and the seats were good the coliseum is an excellent venue  very large nice big stage plush seats they even have a bar so you can bring a drink in note that the prices are way above your typical vegas price,1.0
they were efficient overall friendly competent and nice followup they explained our air conditioning issue came by earlier than initially scheduled because they were able to squeeze us in a day earlier and then fixed the issue no nonsense on time the only confusion on my part is that the scheduler said it was 40 for the initial visit to give an estimate but then charged 45 i didnt mention it but that was the only discrepancy had to refill our refrigerant due to a leak i will definitely give them a call if i need them again,1.0
went to songbird on a whim and absolutely loved it my sister and i parked in the lot to the right when looking at the shop but i think theres parking in the back its a very cozy hip and quaint little coffee and tea shop my sister ordered the prickly pear herbal tea and i ordered the mocha everything is made to order which i appreciate but you do pay for it for the two 16 ounce iced drinks it was about 13 the tea was brewed to this beautiful color and flavor it was a refreshing delight the mocha was not your average chocolate coffee flavor it had this smooth and medium thickness to it i am not a huge coffee drinker but this mocha takes the gold when i go to coffee shops i order mochas because its a specialty drink and how will i know if i have had the best if i dont try them all whenever i can i appreciated the lady who works there too she had long braids and was so nice and friendly she was very personable and enjoyed talking about food it was kind of hipster for my taste but the drinks made up for it i will definitely come back here,1.0

pastel colours lots of old people the suburbshave you accidentally wandered into a retirement home no youve just set foot inside the little cheflocated inside a strip mall the little chef personifies what a neighborhood family restaurant should beplenty of seating of both the table and booth variety the space is open and airy youll never feel crammed in beside the folks next to youin terms of food the little chef is a comfort food lovers dream soups sandwiches meat pies eat in or take home frozen multiple types of burgers pastas and even the odd more adventurous item like a thai stir fry or lambthis isnt to say any of the food is bland far from itthe day we stopped by for lunch i had the threesome a spinach salad tuna melt and tart of the day while the lady had a large soup of the day potato leek and a fish burger with saladthe soup arrived in a large bowl and we both enjoyed the chunks of vegetables floating in the hearty brothour mains arrived and the tuna melt was served on an english muffin with sharp cheddar melted over the tunascallioncelery filling so far as tuna melts go this was in my top 5 the spinach salad had fresh spinach hard boiled eggs and a zippy vinaigrette the fish burger was a halibut patty which was crisp and lightly breaded some home made tartar sauce on the side was a nice touchthe tart of the day was banana cream and it was creamy and rich but not cloyingly supersweet which is too often the downfall of desserts like this ive never seen an empty room at the little chef regardless of time of day theres always a table with young children families of multiple generations or seniors who have been married longer than ive been alive out for a nice mealthis is definitely one of the safer choices you could pick for dining in calgary however if youre faced with a group of differing ages and pallets the little chef will provide something for everyone,1.0

i had been wanting to go to haberdish since i first moved to charlotte i had read such great reviews and wanted to try things out for myself i got the chicken tenders which were huge so i could only eat 2 i also got the small size of the charred okra which was probably my favorite part of the meal you have to get the bacon jam on top i also ordered the mac and cheese with the spicy chicken skins on top the macaroni was very good but the chicken skins definitely bring some heat to the dish so be aware of that the small size of the sides is definitely enough to feed 23 people depending on how hungry you are and the tenders are big so 2 were plenty i also got a biscuit to go with the meal and it came with their sweet tea butter which was fantastic i would highly recommend this place and i cant wait to go back next time i want to go for brunch i follow them on instagram which makes my mouth water every time they post a picture,1.0

xs is located at the wynn which currently still has free parking and it is one of the most elegant night clubs in vegas the dj is between an inside dance floor and an outside pool area  truly making it the best of both worlds i recently came back to xs recently and i noticed many improvements so i decided it was time to update my review a special shout out to my promoter edward ig modernedd who put me on the guest list for friday night with diplo since we were all girls we were able to get quite an express entrance entering before most of the people who bought general admission tickets we entered from the pool area and the view was stunning there was lights across the top from the sides leading to the central bar area that even has casino tables now there was also the addition of seating areas for the girls to sit around on security was also more relaxed because before they would yell at you to get up and move if you are sitting around a non tableservice area this definitely makes xs a more friendly place for the ladies to come dance and rest a bit cause high heels are painful my friend and i were lucky to come in while it was not too busy yet so we took plenty of pictures with the bar area pool and lights in the background it was beautifulwhile hanging by the bar area we received some drinks my friend had the long beach 20 which is a long island with a splash of cranberry juice instead of a splash of coke cause pink drinks are better looking than brown drinks and i had an adios 20 my goto blue drink that is also lovely in pictures after some light chit chat we finished out drinks and entered the main dance floor inside my rule is to go deep enough into the dance floor that you are not near the entrance if you stay by the entrance all of the people trying to go in and out will push through you my girl and i found a great spot and it was all positive vibes and fist bumps from there once it got hot and stuffy inside we went back outside for some fresh air i love having the option to go in and out as i please and i truly feel like that is one of the best things about xs that has it maintaining its reputation as one of the top clubs in vegas even as other clubs like marquee and tao has slipped the test of time dont get me wrong omnia is still my favorite but xs has a secure spot for 2nd ,1.0

this is it if youre looking for a new dental clinic or wanting to switch to a new one archer dental is the final answer to your searchive always been afraid to go to the dentists and thus all my cleanings in the past years have huge gap between each one whats worse is that every single time was a painful process so the year is coming to an end and ive been paying for my benefits so i thought not to waste any money and get it done archer dental was able to fit me in right away and was very friendly over the phone to explain all the details about their pricing and going over with me of what my insurance would and would not cover on the appointment day the hygienist was very thorough on explaining each step of the way during the exam as well as the cleaning process she offered a warm lavender pillow to go behind my neck and another pillow goes around the neck that shaped like a u to make sure that i was all comfortable most importantly she offered me num gels before she started the cleaning since i had zero pain tolerance and its been a long while since i had my last one done the whole time shed made sure that i was okay and she continued to make convo so that i was distracted from the cleaning on a scale of 1 to 10 10 being the most painful i would say in my experience with archer dental its 3 of course at some point it was quite painful but for the most part its nothing this wonderful experience is almost like a gift from santa and i am looking forward to my next appointment alreadyi give this dental clinic a 10 out of 10 rating the whole environment is very friendly and welcoming look no more give this one a try and you wont regretps this is my first yelp review its a great experience not to share,1.0

tried this place after seeing it on yelp head towards the back of the casino and go up the escalator to toby keiths bar to find it tried the green grape ice cream with strawberries raspberries and mango delicious guy taking the orders was hilarious and had tons of energy possibly the owner recommended for anyone wanting something sweet without a bunch of sugar,1.0
i love this place we finally returned after waiting for the spring training visitors to leave and while there was still a wait it was a short 15 minute wait time for the 2 of us the hostesses do a great job and always have it together theyre always courteous and just like everyone else there they work hardwe sat inside as it was first available which was more than fine the inside was full however it wasnt extremely loud like some places get we always get our food right away and always without mistakes i got the santa fe scrammle which is always good the serving size says two eggs but its a huge portion i like butters giving you the choice of fruit grits or hash browns while still giving you the  next choice of pancakes or toast when you get an omelette or scrambler i also added zucchini and peppers to my dish and it was only a 025 up charge for each my bf got the two eggs with fruit and bacon as a protein he also got a short stack of blueberry pancakes the pieces of bacon are a good sizeeggs were scrambled perfectly and he loves the pancakes every time the prices are very reasonable and the servers and bus staff are very attentive thank you butters staff so much for letting me wake up and know i have a place for breakfast i can go that wont disappoint,1.0
i had never heard of this place before although ive spent time in garrison woods just south of marda loop most notably across the street at the starbucks but i met a few friends for dinner here one of them chose this placewe had resos for 445 and we were the only people there by the time we left at 630 it was almost full so i would recommend calling ahead to reserve for surewhat i really liked about the place was our waitress was very personable she went through the chefs special was easy to talk to didnt feel like she was trying to be nice and she was dressed very formally i dont go to a restaurant to look at the waitresses so it was nice that she wasnt showing a lot of leg or cleavageshe was very prompt in bringing out our drinks the bread and taking our orders she knew the menu really well as we had questions about some of the entrees and she was able to answer them easilythe food itself was delicious i ordered the seafood pasta which was a large portion but it was ok since i was really hungry our waitress notice im not saying her name  she never introduced herself to me and i neglected to ask was great throughout the meal topping up our drinks and seeing if we needed anything she wasnt overbearing though so just the right amounti would highly recommend going here if you live anywhere close to garrison woods i highly enjoyed the food ,1.0
these guys are the best movers hands down they are pros at packing and super fast they can pack and move anything i was amazed at how quickly they wrapped our furniture and loaded it into and off of the truck i highly recommend their service call kevin for a quote he wont try to sell you anything you dont want and gives you tips on how to save money if youre interested they may cost a few dollars more than the competition but well worth it,1.0

went there for my dads birthday because they are supposed to be the birthday place to eat   we were there at 6 pm on a thursday and were pretty much the only diners in the place  waited at least 40 minutes for the 4 of us to get our food    food was ok but wtf did they have to kill the cow to make it   i can see why the place was dead as far as business  ive heard the owner is moving on   maybe will be better then as of now would not go back,0.0
we had a wonderful dinner on the beautiful patio the service was perfect we know our server was extremely busy but despite how many tables he had he answered every menu question we had and was very accurate on the wine descriptions all while making us feel that we were his only table and main focus i love the menu and had a hard time decided between the many selections we decided on the tuna sea bass and pasta special all were excellent dishes but my favorite was the tuna seared perfectly rare it was a great choice for a hot summer evening,1.0
this was one of my favorite meals during our weeklong vegas trip we stayed in the jockey club which is connected to the cosmopolitan so the majority of our meals took place in there because they have a lot of decent restaurants i had this place bookmarked in the weeks leading up to the trip but i didnt really pay attention to where exactly it was on the strip i also hadnt planned well for the weather and brought mostly black dresses well this place is located in the venetian if you dont know how far the venetian is from the cosmopolitan just imagine how long the strip is then imagine walking about half of the strip just for lunch with one person in your party wearing a black dress and the other wearing a dress suit and pants this is during summer when the high reaches nearly 110 degrees during the day yes my boyfriend loves me very much to be dealing with this sort of thingwe finally arrived and noticed the interesting decor which was not traditional at all we knew this was a fusion restaurant but we were starting to worry that the food wouldnt be as good as advertisedluckily our worries were put to rest after receiving the appetizer we ordered which were gyoza with kombucha paste filling they were tangy and if dipped into the sauce salty very delightfuli would recommend to every customernext the manager came over and talked with us for a bit before recommending the sea bass skewers with peruvian corn we hesitated a bit because we wanted sushi for lunch on account of our plans for a buffet at dinner but he insisted that it was a plate that shouldnt be overlooked so we got itsoon after he returned with complimentary ceviche tacos as a gift for buying so much food we also got a special roll each and a roll to share quite a lot of food for a meal we wanted to be lightthe tacos were decent id say 35 stars interesting to try but i wouldnt say id order them if i return the skewers however were 55 the corn was huge and chewy while the skewers were wellflavored and cooked and unbelievably tender i am immensely grateful that the manager suggested these as it was one of the most unique dishes ive ever had i would recommend these to any customer as welli didnt try my boyfriends roll because i dont like shrimp in my sushi but my roll was pretty good i wanted their samba roll but settled for the maine lobster roll it may be difficult to believe but i thought there was a little too much lobster on the roll dont hurt mewe split a basic salmon avocado roll which was average it ended up being a lot of food in general but a lot more than we expected to get if you love food especially sushi and you love trying new things do not come here expecting a light meal you will eat a lot and leave pleasantly full but be unable to eat your next meal,1.0
recently bought a laptop from this store also bought a setup package to 100  total spend just under 100000  setup was lousy took the laptop home and it was not working wifi issue i have a number of other electronics that use wifi in the house that had no issues just this brand new laptop  took the laptop back to the store the geeksquad looked at it said it is your internet connection at home you need to go home an reboot so off i go back home reboot and laptop wifi continues to drop not work again next day took back to the store and was told we redo the setup another day later took the lap top hold and again worked better but not to the specifications as provided by the manufacturer took the laptop back to the store they replaced  took the new laptop back home and  laptop does not even connect via ethernet and wiif definitely does not connect again took the laptop backwas offered to get another brand yet there was no other brand that would be equivalent to what i was looking for asked for full refund was told no refund on the service which they were now telling me was 14900refused and argued for over 2 hours eventually the store clerk realized that i should not be charge 14999 after i had to take pen to paper they wanted to over charged mein reality they service they provided was not worth the 100 or 149  i should have been provided full refund but was told they do not refund labour   do not shop here  they will get youthey kept trying thorought the last 2 weeks to sell me the extended warranty so they knew there was problems with the laptop yet continued to sell to customers not reputablebuyer be ware future shop not a company you can trust nor should you spend your money i lost 100 but they have now gained a reputation that shows them as being sharks,0.0
this location is horrible the management is very rude i ordered a chili cheese dog and i was very disappointed i felt cheated i received a penny sized amount of chili on my hot dog and no cheese when they even charged me extra for cheese i showed it to the manager who seemed to be a lady of mexican decent she didnt even care she basically said too bad and wouldnt refund my money not even replace it with the correct item i ordered horrible customer service the only good thing about it was the restrooms were surprisingly pretty clean maybe they make their employees complete a training course in cleaning restrooms instead of how to make a damn hot dog i will never return to this location dont be cheating your customers i asked for a side a of jalapeos and they only gave me four and charged me extra,0.0

ive been to this salon 3 times my first experience was great i had victoria who gave me a wash a trim and offered to blow dry my hair straight total came out to 15 my second time was with carmecita who specializes in curly hair which i have she was so sweet she also gave my hair a wash a trim but no drying total was 40 which did catch me off guard third time is the reason i will not be going back i had cyndi she gave me a trimblow dried my hair straight and used a straighterwhich i dont get why victoria didnt need one anyways no wash was included because i had already washed my hair the total came out to 60 which is ridiculous i didnt have any special work done ive always asked for the same thing how does it go from 1560 i feel prices need to be discussed ahead of time because its just absolutely ridiculous moving on i have my hair trimmed into a v versus straight across cyndi completely gave me something else which is shown in the pics this was just plain horrible when we were done i didnt notice it because obviously i can only see so much from my viewpoint but once i got home my family instantly noticed it and i had an event that day i was so upset i hate getting a trim in general because i like my hair long so because cyndi messed up i had to get it cut twice my hair is so short now and i hate it all thanks to cyndi who shouldve just flat out said she had no experience in doing a v cut i then proceeded to call karathe shop owner she apologized and said shed be able to fix it wednesdaythis happened on saturday you must be crazy if you think im gonna walk around with choppy hair for 4 days client satisfaction is definitely not a priority at this salon i was refunded but a refund cant fix how short my hair is now for the sake of your hair dont go here update words are being thrown left and right here  cyndi never said those words why would i go back to her to redo my hair id run the risk of leaving with a bob point being pictures speak for themselves,0.0

i came to get a pedicure and specifically asked if they could cut any of my ingrown toe nails because they were hurting me and they didnt whatsoever cut them cutting ingrown toe nails out the correct way is what they learn in training and she totally had no idea what she was doing when she cut my toe nails they were all crooked and the worker was being super rough pedicures are one of the most simplest jobs to do at nail salons and this was the first time ive ever been unsatisfied with getting a pedicure i will never get a pedicure here again,0.0

if youre shopping for a veterinarian please read this if i could give zero stars i would this doctor has been in practice for 43yrs you would think as such he would be passionate about helping animals and maybe he does love our pets however his approach to veterinary medicine is severely outdated this dvm did not give my pet pain meds after he removed a portion of a tumor i received absolutely no post operative instructions when i picked my pet up there was no follow up call the next day after my pets surgical procedure upon requesting the biopsy results a week later the doctor had the receptionist tell me my pet had cancer i was informed he was too busy with surgery that day to give me his results himself when asked what type of tumor it was the receptionist advised me he didnt know and that the doctor doesnt normally tell owners what type of tumor  i recently left the veterinary industry after working in it over a decade  this doctor has clearly checked out after his 43yrs i imagine his positive reviews are due to his low prices his prices are low for a reason do not let that fool you i hope that in your search for a veterinarian you read this and steer clear of this practice make sure that when your pet goes under anesthesia you find out that the doctor is going to follow best practices including administering iv fluids and pain medications make sure no corners are going to be cut good luck in your searchthere are many great veterinarians out there do not decide on cost alone ask questions,0.0

after living in san diego for a few years i was in desperate need of an authentic tj style taco and i have found it here they serve traditional street style tacos with all your typical toppings if they man working there tells you a salsa is hot take his recommendation and dont pour it all over your taco because chances are its really freaking hoti recommend beef tongue if they have it but if not chicken is my second choice no other pittsburgh taco place compares to las palmas for me the tacos are 250 and 2 will fill me up cash only for tacos cards inside the store,1.0

this place redefines the meaning of small i watched and marveled as they were constructing my small chicken shawarma meal it was packed to the brim and that was before any of the generously portioned chicken was placed on top it wouldnt matter as much if the taste wasnt up to par but thats not the case here the flavours all worked together without anything being too distinct and distracting its a far walk from my workplace but its a walk that ill look forward to making again very soon,1.0
i took my entire family to this restaurant for the first time and as soon as we walked in a fat and lazy hostes girl made us to wait for a table for about 10 minutes the restaurant was pretty empty then we finally got a table and waited about 15 minutes for a glad of water and menus with a bad actitud i almost took my family to another restaurant but i didnt want to drive another 20 minutes so we ordered food took about 40 minutes to get it oh by the way the restaurant was empty but 3 tables that is embarrassing so anyway never coming back to this place,0.0

this is a horrible location for mailing copying and other printing services the clerks and the owner have been rude snide arrogant and provide horrendous customer service this is the third time ive personally received or seen them provide terrible service  i wont go back again the counter now contains a myriad of signs filled with misspellings and grammatical errors i certainly wouldnt use any of their layout design or computer based services based on this evidence when i went last week to drop off a package and pick up some stamps the clerk said he could not  punch holes in an address book  for an elderly customer i pointed out that the drills could easily be moved to accommodate the smaller book he acknowledged that it could but it was too difficult and then shrugged the customer and i exchanged incredulous and confused glances too difficult to move the drills on a 3 hole punch on another occasion the owner was shrill and rude to customers waiting in line when i called to inquire about notary services she rudely repeated several times that she was the only person there and that i would have to bring witnesses i went to the ups store in ballantyne where they used another employee as a witness and we asked another customer to be a witness it worked out great and their store was courteous and friendly dont use this location for any services whatsoever they are rude unpleasant and discourteous to customers of all races creeds ages and genders read the other reviews on google and other locations,0.0

my original compliant was never resolved and the owners responses are all avoiding the fact that he is not standing behind his 5 year warrantyhe continues to avoid the fact that the original installation was botched and then patched to cover the mistake  i have posted pictures to point this out talking about the manufacturer and the product has nothing to do with installation  from what i know these are not employees that tint windows for him but rather someone he contracts to do the job for him  this counters his claim of years of window tinting experience  i can hire someone too  wait a minute i did that and it didnt work outoffering to replace the rear window tint after having done nothing while having the vehicle all day shows what his intentions were to continue to hide the poor installation as long as he could  the more i questioned the color and the slow response the waste of my day for 0 changes to the appearance the angrier he became my writing the attorney general and bbb are all within my rights as a consumer to seek assistance with locating a possible resolution to issue with a local businesscompany  also writing a review on yelp helps to ensure other consumers do not get the same poor treatment i have not written my coworkers i shared my experience with 2 of my friends at work this typically works in favor of a good establishment  in this case he is not happy about me sharing my poor experience with his company  also these friends did not visit him one did write him on social media to state that he will no longer be recommending his services to any other friends  reading on other forms of review sites yelp and facebook for example the owner is continually rude to those that question his business practice  he is a hothead and cannot fathom anyone disliking the service so much so that every complaint turns to an argument with these customers  i agree with them and my reviews are an attempt to keep this from happening to other good consumers if i knew that the owner would not stand behind his 5 year warranty i would have never purchased tint and had it installed by auto details,0.0

i dont recommend this school  the staff is extremely helpful and friendly until you get in and are vested  credits only transfer to other regionally accredited schools and costs thousands of dollars each so once you take a few youre vested  sooo many people fail out  even the best of students have to worry about passing after studying every minute of every day  nursing school is already tough but this accelerated program takes it to a whole new level,1.0

a couple of weeks ago i was out on a drunken bender at a bar and while fumbling in my pocket i somehow managed to deactivate fingerprint recognition and trigger the self defense mandatory backup password on my galaxy s6  obviously i dont know my backup password so like any other redblooded american i started trying all of my 6000 other passwords i could vaguely remember using in my lifetime unaware in my inebriated state that my smart phone was keeping track of each misfire and holding it against me  the next day eventually it started demanding a password retrieval via my gmail account login to which i also did not have my password  when i attempted to change my password on my gmail account i got stonewalled i couldnt change my password without a verification code and i couldnt get a verification code unless i could unlock my phone to retrieve a text   so this turned into a massive catch 22 and the whole thing blew up in my face as i felt my entire life spiraling downward into the toilet one incorrect login attempt at a time i called customer service and spoke to a couple nice people that were understanding but tried to convince me that the only solution was going to be a hard reset  no thanks  no way am i going to lose every kb of stored data ive worked so hard to horde in this last year because of a clumsily executed fingerprint id attempt  tmobile customer service then hands me off to google and i went through the whole thing with their tech support as well  turns out gmail is like really secure  those guys dont mess around with identity theft  if you are unable to reset your password using their standard recovery system you can kiss your account goodbye  basically i got told the same thing as tmobile customer care  factory reset  so then i call samsung  they have this really neat app that can unlock your phone anywhere in the world and i started getting a little excited that this was going to work  the young lady that was guiding me  through the process got me to the samsung account login and wouldnt you know that its linked to my gmail login  at this point ive spent 3 hours talking to people from 3 different customer care departments on multiple continents and now im drinking again  whiskey for the pain  i decided to make one more phone call before surrendering to the factory reset  i called the nearest retail store this one on charleston spoke with a guy named chad and told him the whole story  i was like is there any way to get a verification code sent to another phone since i have two phones on my accounthe thought about it for maybe 10 seconds and tells me you can switch the sim cards and receive a text on the other phone then switch them backgenius  i switched the sim cards reset the phone received the gmail verification text reset my gmail password logged in to my samsung account and reset my password used the mydevice global unlock to unlock my phonemoral of the story  fingerprint id technology on your phone is unnecessary and can be dangerous when it falls into the wrong handsmine also special thanks to chad for some slick thinking on the fly and for saving all my vacation photos from the last year,0.0

this in n out is always busy but the employees work super fast i was surprised my food came out within 5 minutes considering the amount of people ahead of me the place is clean too always seeing workers cleaning and sweeping okay story time clumsy me i wrapped my invisalign retainers in a napkin and mistaken it for trash by the time i realized it was gone we were already on the freeway i quickly called in n out but it transferred me to corporate i explained to the lady what had happened and she contacted the manager i was already turning back to in n out when i got there these 2 boys were going through all the trash cans and i felt so bad i insisted that if it wasnt there its fine however one of the boy said to me that this is fun and he didnt mind at all because it was different and not the same boring routine he had a positive attitude and was very determined the fact that he was so happy to do this instead of being grumpy from going through the trash made it a better experience the other boy decided to check the waste in the back and it felt like a miracle he came out with the retainers in the wrapped napkin just how i left it i was so happy i wanted to give him a hug lol but i didnt this was all less than 10 mins when i got int the car the lady from corporate called me back to inform that they found my trays i was really grateful that corporate and the in n out manager had good and quick communication skills makes me love in n out so much more,1.0

for people with allergieswe had 2 guys in our dinner group today that had serious dairy allergies and based on the clearly labeled dairy free entrees on the online menu we decided to dine here however once we reached graze the waitress and then the manager said they cant make the supposed dairy free entrees without cross contaminating the dishes this by definition is not dairy free and definitely presents a problem for people with allergies the restaurant also marks certain tems as gluten free and other allergens free the manager explained that the cross contamination problem is also at play for these allergens and it would not be safe for example for people with celiac disease to dine there anyway the restaurant misrepresents itself as a progressive restaurant that can accommodate allergies but in reality this is not the case,0.0

wether ive gone in for a gorgeous set of red dip powder or a fresh looking french manicure jenni and her team always do an amazing job i quickly became a client after jenni  did an amazingly flawless dip powder application to my natural nails at her recommendation  not only did i fall in love with dip powder i dont even entertain the thought of gel polish anymore my nails look amazing and are in the best shape ever no more chipping nail polish or gel polish that would peel offso irritating and such a waste of my hard earned money im always happy to bring my business to lacquer lounge and know its worth the price to receive the best customer service at a saloon that uses premium quality products and couldnt be happier with the beautiful location parking is never an issue since there is the large overflow parking behind starbucks grab a coffee and sit in a pedicure chair while chit chatting and receiving amazing customer serviceyes please,1.0

i was impressed with safeway compared to its competitor taipan tour  the bus was very comfortable  the tour guide told us that they removed an entire row from the bus so customers can have more leg rooms  the bus was chartered from megabus so it had onboard wifi both in canada and in the usa and also had power outlet in every seat  our bus initially had some wifi issue and the tour guide was telling the customers that we might be switching to another bus because of it  this was very unexpected from a chinese company and its good service  the tour guide was very professionala bit too much talking  talked about every city that we pass by    as always with these chinese tour its always see as much in as little amount of time as possible  we visited 4 cities in 4 days and it felt very rushed also the price is unbeatable  we stayed at hilton hotels for 3 nightsof course not prime location but its very comfortable,1.0

i was just there  4135 i regret that i did not listen to an earlier review to do myself a favor by staying away from this one i have had great experience over 10 yrs with meineke elsewhere may be thats why i  gave this place a shot two shots actually long story short was there for an oil change and was talked into buying a package for degrease and diagnosis of a possible minor oil seepage test resultno definitive finding with suggestion that valve cover gasket may be leaking again they repeatedly said gasket may not be the sole problem my damn question is why the heck you charge 70 bucks for diagnosis that you cant be certain a simple google search tells you that gasket may be the most obvious cause maybe there was no issue with the leak at all  next day i hesitantly went there again to fix the gasket issue and the front guy when writing the order said he will absorb the diagnosis fees paid yesterday with the work done today an hour later the bill comes as intact and on reminding him to absorb the test fee he completely denies that anything like that was promised luckily there were two other customers in the lobby had overheard the conversation and vouched for me completely disgusting poor business ethics and terrible customer skills i am yet to evaluate them on technical grounds as to whether the oil leak they supposedly discovered was real and has now fixed because of my previous good experience with the franchise i was there but definitely this is a really bad apple and by all means should be avoided this is just my personal experience from last two consecutive visits and i thought i should let the public know,0.0

5 stars purely for the variety of flavors and staff honestly i thought the strength of the daiquiri was weak but once you add a shot its not bad at all for the price its a bit on the high side but mehits vegas everything is overpriced we went back a few times for refills and our drinks did get noticeably stronger with each refill so that was nicereally though drinking daiquiris all day is a bad idea with all the sugar added we all had headaches at the end of the day but it was fun and a necessary vegas experience i think the apple flavored one is amazing with an extra shot of vodka just so ya know ,1.0

this new kid in town is definitely a welcome addition to the southwest valley  for only 799 you can custom build your own pizza  there are three different crusts to choose from  traditional wheat and gluten free quite a few sauces and cheeses to pick from including their house blend cheese and a kale pesto sauce that i would have to try next time  they have all the traditional types of meats such as meatball italian sausage bacon crumble and some not so traditional meats such as sweet sriracha chicken and some vegan meats too  what i really love in their veggie section is the grilled zucchini  once your custom pizza is made it is flashed cooked in under 5 minutes thru a conveyor belt  it doesnt have the crispiness of a wood fired pizza but i like it a lot because the crust is chewy and not too crispy their toppings are fresh and quite tasty  i ordered their traditional crust pizza with pesto sauce  then i loaded it with house blend cheese italian sausage meatball chicken breast ham black olives artichokes grilled zucchini mushroom roasted garlic and spinach  they actually put the spinach on top after cooking so the spinach doesnt get all crispy and all dried up it was very appealing to look at and quite delicious  the crust wasnt all dried up  but when i got the pizza home it wasnt very hot at all  it was actually only lukewarm  i dont know if that was because there were too much toppings and it should have been cooked a little longer or because of the thin crust it cooled off real fast  maybe next time i would have to eat it there instead of asking for take outi would definitely go back and try some other combinations  i was a little surprised that they were not busy around supper time  but bonus for me because i did not have to wait in any line,1.0

id be lying if i said my husband and i werent skeptical about this place we have nothing against guy fieri but with all his over the top lingo off the chain really and his multiple shows where he eats other peoples foods but rarely cooks and when he does he wont eat eggs  we kind of thought he was a hack and this would be a tourist destination for fans and not foodies everything about el burro borracho proved us wrong from the drinks the caliente margarita and cadillac margarita were both excellent to the awesome bar staff huge thanks to jerika and anthony our bartenders to the food itself the experience was such a pleasant surprise we shared the medium spicy guacamole with chicharrones which they prepare tableside to your liking and it was so fresh the mexican fundido was just delicious i had the beef machaca enchiladas for my main and i couldnt believe how good it was  like literally so surprised how insanely tasty my husband had the carne asada tacos which were so tender and flavorful beyond the food which was shockingly good the staff there really care about the restaurant and the brand and proudly defended mr fieri when we teased them about him will it last we sure hope so there are tons of great restaurants in las vegas but the whole dining experience here was way above and beyond what we expected guy fieri  we guess youre alright after all next time were here at the rio well be back,1.0
first of all a store that is advertised as a ramen store should at least be using real ramen noodles instead they committed the biggest food crime by substituting the more expensive ramen noodles with chinese lo mein noodles to make it worse the broth is basically hot water with tons of msg the pork tastes like dry cardboard and it seems that the chef do not even know how to properly cut a meat the egg is over boiled and even the mushroom used are the ones used for the actual lo mein dish the worst crime is to actually having the audacity to charge 9 for a lo mein soupi would recommend not supporting a dishonest business that tries to trick the customers basically if you are looking for some decent ramen avoid this place at all costs,0.0
stopped in after some shopping for a bite to eat  i had chicken fried steak and it was not the conventional chicken fried steak more of a batter fried then a breaded and fried  it wasnt bad just not what i was expecting  my husband had the grilled ribeye  he loved it our waitress jamie was great  she was friendly and  attentive but not overly so  she suggested dessert and i had the chocolate chip cookiefreshly baked so it was still warm when she brought it to the table  with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce  its a good size cookie enough for 2 and was delicious  will definitely go back again,1.0

always liked this place before today but they were nasty when i tried to pay  they have some subpar counterfeit scanner and tried to refuse to let me pay its a real 10 dollar bill dont refuse my money or demand i go get different cash  i looked up the scanner and the user manual states that if the money has been through the wash if it has been crumpled or if it is dirty it will fail their scan yet they dont even have a starch pen as backup if you go here dont try to pay cash or they will give you trouble too,0.0
i havent been here in 20 years so its changed a little if youre going on a weekend go when it opens i was there for 4 hours and by the time we were leaving it was a zoo there is a lot to look at and learn its an information overload we saw the pompeii exhibit and wildlife photography exhibit both were very informative and well laid out most exhibits had monitors where you could watch videos about what you happen to be looking at for exhibits like pompeii it would be nice to have a short movie to sit down at watch like an intro to the pieces youll be looking at it was a lot of reading and a lot to take inthe rom is well lit bright and spacious luckily there were many spots for you to sit down and take a break they also had a lot of activities to keep kids busy it was nice to see parents taking their kids there and helping them understand what theyre looking at,1.0

very disappointed in this company for false promises and lack of communicationi bought an enlaes trunk spoiler for my audi s4 at the beginning of april 2016 through their website i understood it took about 46 weeks for production after 8 weeks or so i called for an update on my product they said that their distributor were having problems with their moldings and that they will ship out soon as they were already finishing up on new sets another month has passed which is already july 2016 i call for an update on my paid product they told me the same thing which they are still working on new sets and that it should be shipping out soon each time i called they told me that they will call the distributor and call me back as soon as they have answers they did not call backits already aug 2016 and i have been patient the whole time and i finally gave up and called for a refund they immediately called the distributor and said that the owner at enlaes has offered to upgrade the spoiler to a carbon fiber one since i ordered the frp trunk spoiler which is not carbon i said okay since they promised that it would ship within the next week they also made a tracking label and emailed me the infoits september 2016 the tracking label has expired due to no activity they never shipped anything out i called every week for status and the same false promising response was told to me they made another shipping label and sent me the info out of all the calls i made they told me they will give me a call back the next day for a response or answer they did not call onceits today october 14 2016 shipping label already expired last week i made the call to see the status same answer they claim they cant get a hold of enlaes i have been very frusterated and claimed for a refund i was promised a upgrade for the wait nothing was compensated and was not apologized for the inconvenience i am currently waiting for my refund i will not shop here again,0.0

the 1 star review is specific to the doctor who performed my first chalazion removal  her name is dr helga pizio  she was very nice and personable but her technique is in need of improvement  she didnt numb me first just stuck a clamp in my eye to hold down my lid stuck me with a steroid shot and starting in with the cutting  it was so painful  i thought the pain was the lidocaine shot but when she said were almost done i realized she hadnt numbed me at all and the pain i was filling was the cutting itself  within an hour i called the office back describing the excruciating pain i was experiencing and was just told that it was normal to feel some soreness  a few hours later i couldnt stand it and went to the er where i learned the doctor had scratched my cornea  with the amount of pain i was feeling it should have been at least considered that i had a corneal abrasion and told by the office how to handle that  and to top it all off she didnt even get all of it and i had to go back a second time a few weeks later  the second removal was at the same location but with a different doctor dr ksenia stafeeva and a much better experience so thats why its important to note that my rating is just for dr pizio and not for new eyes in general,0.0

my husband and i came for a little getaway and to get married so we decided to stay at the stratosphere at first we thought it might just be a what ever hotel we had never been inside of it i thought that because of the awesome price it must have a down side well as soon as we got there there is valet parking very nice and helpful young men always smiling we walk in to check in hassle free we were there maybe 5 min and had someone take care of us and we upgraded our room to an amazing view the bathroom was very nice so was the room very cozy and neat and nicely decorated too the atmosphere is very loud in the casino but the room was nice and quiet the first night we got married had a great time we went up to the tower its free to go up when you stay at the hotel the lounge there is so amazing it has a breath taking view of he whole city and your mouth just drop open in amazement although if your not to good with heights your legs will get a tingle in them lol my husband was afraid bit got over it the next day the hotel its self has so many things to keep you occupied our second night we were out and about the city and its very easy to get back and forth from the hotel every thing is close we came back to the hotel to see the pin up show its great music dancers and the men love it since the girls get to show a little more but not every thing  as a women i enjoyed it very much the music and dancing is just great  today was our check out date and let me tell you it was even faster than the check in if i could give more stars i would its great i loved it and will definitely recommend to friends and family  thank you stratosphere for making this an unforgettable stay,1.0

since moving to toronto i have felt like a fish out of water in regards to haircuts and salons i was always floundering around in search of an adequate stylist i kept coming across parlour at ossington and queen on yelp and whilst researching salons it opened around the time i moved into my old neighborhood of little italy and the salons pretty and delicate website featuring photographs of stylists decked out in tattoos sporting wicked hairdos intrigued me but it seemed just a little too cool for me the idea of going there to get my hair cut intimidated mecut to no pun intended a year later i was in desperate need of a haircut as id fried my hair real bad encouraged by my months of research and pawning over the parlour website i finally decided to bite the bullet and make an appointment with brionie who has received rave reviews on yelpi walked into the salon and was surprised because its completely white and laid out very simply there are no fancypantsy obnoxious decorations placed out in order to give off the notion that the salon is more hip or fancy than it actually is and thats because this salon doesnt need to make up for shitty haircuts or bad hairdye jobs with pretty trinkets or walls and walls of fancy hair products the stylists at parlour are really just that good and dont need to compensate for a lack of anything with a salon that is aesthetically fancy the salons basic and clean appearance helped me to feel at ease i didnt feel nearly as intimidated as i had before atfer having my hair washed upon arrival brionie came to introduce herself to me brionie is super kind and cool she listened to me patiently as i anxiously apologized about the state of my hair and she laughed in understanding she then proceeded to take my hair and shape it thin it out and cut it so drastically without diminishing the length that it was a miracle stylists are always really hesitant to thin out my hair but i have ridiculously thick hair that needs to be thinned brionie has recognized that and always thins it out appropriately so that it not only looks good it feels amazingthe next time i went to see brionie i said  just cut it off im sick of it i want a cute fun short cut i want it kind of mia farrow i came out with the best hair cut ive ever had she listened to me and took into account my face shape my hair type and generally what i was asking fori am completely comfortable with going to parlour now getting my hair cut is now an enjoyable experience again that i look forward to best of all brionie never judges me for having dead fried hair whereas other stylists have scoffed or scolded she actually used a phrase that i use all the time now especially when talking about her she said if you dont have long gorgeous hair youre gonna fry the shit out of it and thats true i fry the shit out of my hair time and again and when i need it coiffed and perfected i just hop along to brionie at parlour and she fixes me right up,1.0

before all the selfproclaimed foodies say that this is ramen not as good as california ny japan etc keep in mind probably the best broth there is to offer in phoenix so relative to that they get a 5 star already not pretentious or hipster like some of the ramen joints in downtown just a plain ramen shop with no frills with that said constructive criticism would be that the broth has too much garlic flavor and not enough of umami good body to the broth but almost too much as it left a greasy feel from the combination of fat and collagen noodles were lacking some chew if they used the noodles from tampopo it would be great but tampopo broth sucks fried rice had good heat and was cooked well and fluffy flavor was not bad but missing something karaage chicken was ok again too much garlic and not enough other flavorsprice is more of  than  cost me 19 includes tip for a karaage combo with a fried rice side no drink staff were friendly service was quick,1.0

just plain bad  its under new ownership and has really gone downhill  the service was ok  aside from not honoring their coupons i guess if a new owner takes over they dont have to honor any coupons even if the name remains the samehuhthe food was also ok something that tasted like i whipped it up at home  i ordered the pad thai i know it was a gamble to order an asian staple at a canadian eatery  the pad thai was pad thailess  no noodles  instead they swapped it with rice to make it an indian fusion  may want to rename itthe rice was minute rice the veggies were typical stir fry and the nan bread was safeway wholegrain breadthe food didnt taste bad but was misrepresented and for 19 i felt very ripped off  if this meal were 78 then i would feel i got valuebottom line with so many good restaurants downtown dont waste your money here unless you are just stopping for a beer,0.0
nosh and swig is a diamond in the rough  after living in vegas for years and getting tired of the continuous downfall of firefly not to mention longer waits due to more and more tourists frequenting it i am always in search of tapas  i love trying a variety of different foods and being able to share small plates with friends  nosh and swig fills this void in my culinary world the restaurant is hip and modern  the staff props to owners steve and laurie is attentive and friendly  yet most importantly the food is amazing  the menu is laid of by protein or lack thereof since there is a vegetarian section and it is filled with fusion flavors  this could be overwhelming at a restaurant but not here because it is done right  the portions are perfect for sharing and the prices are reasonable so you are able to taste a variety of foods and flavorseverything we tasted was delicious and it was almost impossible to agree on a favorite  i cant wait to go back again and continue to sample and explore the menu as well as the bar menu they will be getting their liquor license soon,1.0

well the theme seems to be same with most of these reviews the customer service is awful and the management is the worst of all if i could rate them a zero star i would i would not even waste your time with them  my husband and i were in search of new living room furniture when we stopped in and lynn our sales person was very helpful and patient with us we werent exactly sure we knew what we were looking for but she took her time and we never felt pushed when we finally decided to order we asked her and the sales manager josh if we change our mind what is the return policy she and josh both said it would be minimal if any bc we were going with very neutral colors josh the sales manager remind you even came out and said it would probably be no more than 10  but if we kept the money in store there would probably be no restocking return fee after much discussions we went ahead and ordered the furniture knowing we could return for a minimal fee well 6 12 weeks went by and we started to think it wasnt going to work out for us anymore and wanted to look at our options i called lynn and informed her that wed changed our mind and wanted to discuss what could be done she was very understanding and set an apt up with their interior decorator the following day well i arrived for my appointment and to my surprise the interior decorator was no longer going to be able to see me no call or anything to inform me of this again lynn apologized and had her wonderful insert sarcasm sales manager josh over to help me instead well that wasnt really what i came in for  having dealt with him briefly before i knew he wasnt the easiest to deal with but since i was there and they assured me he could do the same things as the interior designer could i agreed to meet with him and see what we could come up with  for the majority of the time spent with him it was fine and i found something that i really liked but i wanted to think about it and discuss it with my husband it went downhill when i asked again what can we do with this order now that i know i dont want it he said you can cancel we havent even received the furniture yet it however youre going to have a 30 restocking fee unless i cancel it when i order the other furniture but he still had to run this by the general manager his father 1st and show him my order was doubling in size this is where i feel he slipped big time in his customer service i had all intentions on keeping my money within the store but being told i would only get my full money back was too place my other order 1st   i then told him that he and his sales associate said it would be a minimal stocking fee bc it was a neutral color he then gets very condescending and says im just telling you what our policy is i then correct him and tell him that he and his sales associate should not tell customers it would a minimal fee because it was neutral  at this point i was getting very frustrated with him and his condescending communication and decided i was done dealing with him i asked him to have his general manager call me the next day as i was not happy with his customer service he then gets even more condescending and says what you dont think i have good customer service i just spent an hour and a half of my time with you my response to him was theres a reason your store only has a 2 12 star rating and from reading the other reviews i think your a big part of that reason  sorry sweet heart thats sales and if im looking at spending over 5000 with you and your store your customer service better be a hell of a lot better than that bottom line we ate the 30 bc id be damn if i spent anymore money with that family business of theirs if you have your heart set on lazy boy there are other retailers out there so no need to settle for their crappy customer service  i went to slumberland and was able to order the exact sectional with better financing to boot,0.0
visited the place with high hope after seeing the four star rating food was cheap and tasted cheaper we tried three dishes  the sweet and sour fish was okay but a bit on the sour side with too much sauce  the ginger beef tasted pretty much the same as the pepper steak both were bland  you can get the same spring rolls in the supermarket  all in all a  experience,1.0

my family and i went on a sunday evening and was told the wait was 20 mins  40 minutes later we were still waiting in a lineup that had no system where people were seated according to how pushy they were and how much they harassed the seating host i was appalled that such a big restaurant had such a disorganized seating structure people who got there after us had been seated before us  after i finally decided to complain and ask when we were actually being seated the host takes us to a table that hasnt been cleaned yet  with the table cleaned and us seated the waitress taking orders purposely ignored our table to take orders from people who already had food on their table finally after waiting another 20 mins at the table without service or even tea repeatedly asking to be served we got up and left after the waitress took the order of a table that had arrived after us  im not sure how a restaurant like this can operate and be successful but its definitely not getting our service again  in the end we went to the keg and had a nice relaxing dinner for cheaper then what we would have spent here that we didnt have to fight for  i dont care if the food is great or freshthe service was terrible and not worth any amount of potential good foodlesson must be aggressive and fight for your spot in order to be seated and fight again to be served,0.0

if you ever want to have a quick nap before drinking this is the place to be i literally waited almost 30 mins for one drink and there was six different people behind the counter making drinks plus there wasnt much people how is it even possible to make a drink this long i literally could have went back read instructions on how to make the drink make a couple of test runs for taste purposes  and still make it before this place makes my drink i feel like they imported the mangoes from beijing like one of the bottles they sell the corn was like fresh out of the can to top it all off to make a long story short i am never going back to this place nor recommending it to anyone i am only putting one star here because i cant put zero whoever manages this place should be ashamed of the type of service their employees provide,0.0
i love the atmosphere of this place but they fall short in so many other places we went here for dinner last night and we were highly disappointed with both the food and service we had to wait 15 minutes for a table to start which is absurd considering there were no less than 8 open tables we were just a party of 2 we decided to wait at the bar which is where we shouldve stayed we were finally seated it took our server a few minutes to come greet us we started with the lobster and crab spring rolls which were fried a little too long when we brought this to our servers attention he told us it was to make sure it was crispy we of course never finished those we asked about suggestions from the menu the servers response was the most affordable way is to make a meal out of one burger to split and an appetizer now i dont know if maybe the fact that we were dressed in jean and tshirts made a difference but to assume we needed to eat affordably was very insulting to say the least we decided to go with a burger and a sushi roll my burger was cooked closer to med well rather then medium i wanted to complain but our waiter only seemed to be interested in flirting with the table behind us my friends sushi was okay at best to sum it all up we didnt enjoy the appetizer main course and werent even offered dessert we left feeling total unsatisfied my friend said that experience was out of the ordinary and i should give them another try but after that experience i think i would rather not i would rather dine without judgement and assumption of my ability to afford my meal word to the wise dont dress down or comfortably if you want to dine here,0.0

yuck  three times burned  i should have learned after the first twothe first time i went through this drive thru i was served by a rather crass older lady who greeted me through the speaker with an ever so eloquent take yo order  i brushed it off thinking it was no big deal  until i pull up to the window and see an older caucasian gal with dirty hair that looked as if she hadnt had a shower in a few days  greasy haired and snaggly teeth  exactly what you want to see before satisfying the craving for jr bacons  the only words out of her mouth now i cant make this stuff up is eight fiddy  i hand her a 20 and when she hands me back my change i see the worst hands i have ever seen in my entire life  just down right nastysecond time was much the same including the greeting and eight fiddy at the window only this time her hands are even worse  it almost looked as though some kind of flesh eating virus has taken over and was waging a war that it was obviously winning  i learned my lesson from last time and had exact change ready as to avoid any contamination coming from her hands into my pockets  but i cant help and notice a dirty bandage on one of her fingers in a feeble attempt to conceal the horror that was unfolding upon her hands  this is complimenting her stench and even more gross hair  ewww lucky for me the cook handed me the food thru the windowso third timei couldnt even eat it  i did a drive by the window to make sure she wasnt working it  success a nice larger gentleman was working the window  i pull around after ordering my food and much to my delight he was very nice and prompt  only when he hands me back my change his hands were all jacked up too  and to top it all off he had what appeared to be open wounds on his second knuckle on two fingers  i apprehensively take the change  not wanting to contaminate the vehicle again  i put the change in on the center counsel not wanting to even think about it  the food comes out and wam another gross shot confirming the hideousness of this poor mans handsi take the food pull out on the street and throw it out the window at about 55 miles an hour going down cheyenne  that 1150 is glaring at me on the center counsel  i know it has aids  no way was i going to put that back in my pocket and contaminate the rest of my items stowed safely away in there  im cheap i mean like cheap cheap  hence the 199 jr bacons  i speed up grab the money with a napkin from the center counsel and out the window it goes,0.0

this is probably one of the best bang for buck buffets in vegas i always stop by here for dinner everytime i come to vegas i seriously ate so much one time that i had to run into their nice bathroom andbut anyways the lines pretty much a 45min wait on holidays and maybe just 2030 on regular days the first place i hit up is the seafood corner just to stock up on crab legs and sashimi which btw are very fresh then i head over to the meats and poultry lamb and sirloin are super juicy and are something youd find at a steakhouse quality wise then i head over to the pastas and finally the dessertsservice is pretty proficient and quick and the setting isnt really themed or anything like other vegas buffets but still very nice id recommend this place to anyone as one of the best all you can eats in vegas,1.0
the food here is just superb both for lunch and for dinner  combos are good deals and come in a wide variety i highly suggest their steamed seafood as they always seem to get it spot on without overcooking stuff from the wok is as good as ive had anywhere else as well service is decent but the food is what i come for,1.0

i could not be happier with where i live  the longer im here the more impressed i am by the staff  amber amanda shameka and julie in the office are awesome  prompt polite and professional  sal and clyde are beyond great when something needs done or fixed in the building  on top of it morgan communities continues to invest more and more money into the building  theyve totally transformed the main elevator area the gym is massive and the gated parking lots let me rest easy about my car  the location is the best in downtown in my opinion  the back of the building opens up to the flats the front leaves a short walk to w 6th and its no more than a 5 uberlyft to a cavs indians game or e4  if youre looking for downtown living do not look anywhere elseoh and tell them ryan sent you,1.0

i more than highly recommend using superior process service  i was a little leery at first because i am serving someone from out of state and the last company i hired botched the service by serving him on a sunday which is not allowed in ny  however both wendy and tom are amazing people to work with  wendy communicated with me the whole time and asked questions about my states laws to be sure that they followed the laws  the service was done within 2 days of receipt of my information  i hope i never have to serve this deadbeat dad again but if i do i know who to hire to get the job done rightthank you wendy and tom,1.0

more than disappointed time and time again i work in the same complex so i have tried quite a few things of the menu ive had burned onion rings chicken wings that were sooo spicy i couldnt eat them i ordered medium because they dont offer a mild it was not medium they were hot like fire when i got the burned onion rings the waitress that answered the phone was arguing with me about the order instead of offering to fix it they skimp on sauce when they feel like it sometimes ill get a full container and sometimes they half ass it and give me very little i got an order of chicken nachos the other day that were delicious they had plenty of toppings and really tasty cheese sauce all over them  well i wanted to get them again today and was pissed to have paid 11 dollars for some chips barely any cheese at all all i gotta say now is i wont be eating there any more,0.0

do not go  i repeat do not go  i urge you to stay away from this business  read the reviews on google  they are all terrible and i had the same experience btw  they are not registered with the bbb i took in clothes to get dry cleaned and they came back completed wrinkled they might as well have trampled on them and then called them clean  i complained and they took my clothes back again  i came back two days later and guess what the clothes were still totally wrinkled  not only that but they damaged a designer dress of mine  after calling back to see if the owner was in for a week he finally called me from a blocked number  the owner nick dominico told me that the damages were basically my fault and that he would not refund me  he then yelled at me and hung up on me  i filed a formal complaint with the bbb and will follow up with a complaint with the city of scottsdale  go somewhere else,0.0
management i hope youre reading your staff is terrible i refrained from writing a review for this location until ive been here enough times to be sure i have come in on a few occasions and just stand there at the counter all of your employees see me not one person says someone will be with you shortly or anything of the sort my last time i waited 7 minutes before the girl came to the counter she didnt even say oh im sorry about that damn horrible service staff lucky i like your get up and goji otherwise i wouldnt put up with this crap fire your whole crew,0.0
despite many of the extremely poor reviews that marcellos has received on yelpmy wife and i decided to take a chance and dine there last evening  the short of it  i wish we hadnt service was generally good the waitress was attentive and the restaurant had a suitable ambiance  a good combination of family style and traditional italian  the food however was a much different story  my wife and i both ordered pizza  i ordered pepperoni and she ordered canadian bacon with pineapple  both of our pizzas were the most absolutely tasteless bland concoctions we have experienced  there was literally no sauce on either of our pizzas just greasy cheese a very flat bland crust and a small amount of toppings  without sauce the pizza was just terrible  it was dry somewhat greasy from the cheese and it literally had no flavor whatsoever  this was the most disappointing meal that i have had in quite some time and it came to 40 including tip for 2 pizzas 2 soft drinks and 2 salads  when i told the waitress about the quality of the food she simply mentioned that they have a new person preparing the pizzas in the kitchen and that things may be a little off due to the transition  it seems puzzling that someone despite how new they are could forget to put sauce on the pizzas  honestly im not sure sauce alone would have been sufficient to revive marcellos tasteless piesif you are hungry for pizza you will be much better off buying a tombstone or a jacks for 4 at walmart and cooking it yourself  or better yet go to boulders on broadway or grimaldis where you will get excellent food and great service at a comparative bargain price,0.0

unexpected gem  we went for the pretheatre menu expecting a good quick meal  we knew it was a michelin starred restaurant but we recently dined at 2 3 stars so we werent expecting huge things  from the moment we arrived service was impeccable  while we started with tap water our neighbors asked for san pelligrino  while they do not have san pelligrino they serve another type of sparkling water they offered to go to other restaurants to find san pelligrino if needed  they also recognized diners for a few months ago which i though was very niceanyways on to the food  we did the pretheatre menu our amuse bouche was a english pea soup and a croquete of something tasty but i do not recall the details my husband had the beef tartare and i had the lobster bisque  both were perfect  the beef tartare had a perfect mixture of beef and greens and they were paired perfectly with the lotus chips  we did not even touch the accompanying toast because we did not need them  the lobster bisque was lickyourplate clean good  for our main courses we had the salmon and beef tenderloin  the salmon was good but the beef tenderloin was the star  it was the best piece of meat we have had in several years  it was perfectly medium rare  when i cut it and saw the texture i almost cried from how beautiful it was just kidding but i imagine a steak lover somewhere would  my husband sat around with a goofy grin for the next half hour because he was so happy from eating it  the dessert was so creative but tasty  some fancy restaurants make the mistake of being creative and weird tasting im looking at you le meurice with your bee pollen dish aka assault on the tastebuds one was a chocolate ball that came out in a beautiful globe that was promptly melted away by hot fudge to reveal vanilla ice cream and chocolatehazelnut as my husband put it a giant delicious ferraro rocher  i was presented with a coconut  when the lid came off i saw a sea of beautiful white foam  it was coconut foam  if you tasted just the foam itself it was delicious  but combined with the pineapple sorbet and the fruit hiding underneath heavenlyi like food and my husband usually just comes along to these fancy restaurants to appease me but this time he was also very happyyay for you le cirque,1.0

we first at here july 5th had i written a review after that visit they would have earned five stars the meal was flawless tonight july 14th we tried them again and it was a totally different experience two thirds of my entree was actually cold like right out of the refrigerator cold the plate was too hot to touch but most of the food was cold i complained  actually what i asked was to have it reheated the waiter honestly did not seem to be able to comprehend what i was asking he took my meal back into the kitchen the manager came over and actually began to argue with me over whether my food was actually cold he insisted that it was only room temperature pardon me but that is unacceptable food should not be room temperature out of a holding bin and a manager should never argue with a customer especially over a clear health code violation he left and i wondered if they were going to reheat mine bring me a new one or forget the whole thing the waiter came back and asked if i wanted my check when it arrived they had reduced the cost of the one entree by about 50 normally i would have had another talk with the manager but he seemed so clueless that another attempt would have been futile there are many better mexican restaurants in the pittsburgh area hopefully a better one will take its place after this one closes what is a shame is that our first experience there was so good it shows they are capable of being a great restaurant i doubt if i ever would give them another chance i should mention that on our first visit the salsa was great good flavor nice mix of spices with just the right amount of heat on our second visit it tasted like tomato sauce right out of the can,0.0

sorry bill this review is way over due about a year overduei bought a new dryer about 3 years ago a newer style whirlpool cabrio well about two weeks after the warranty expired last summer it started intermittently making an odd oven timer buzzing sound and was having a hard time drying im pretty handy and usually a diyer but i dont have any experience with gas appliances so i went searching and found bill  we called bill up and explained what was happening he came out the first day we were available and of course when he was here we couldnt get it to repeat our issue he looked it over and couldnt find anything obvious since the dryer was playing hard to get we had him look at the oven which hadnt worked since the 2nd day we moved init did work the first day he had it diagnosed and fixed within 30 min he said hed research our dryer to see if anybody else had the same issue he called me two days later with some info on what it could possibly be he said wed replace this part if it doesnt fix the problem then hed refund it we gave it a try but it still started doing the oven timer impersonation we finally were able to get a video of the dryer making the sound after that he was able to do some more research and found something unique to our model that might cause our problem he came out the first day we had off and fixed it in 45 min had to take the whole thing apart to get to the part whirlpool had hid in the back no problems after that bill went way out of the way to track down our issue and at a great priceespecially with my wife haggling him both the dryer and oven are still running greatnew truck looks great billhey you got any recommendations for a hvac tech my ac decided it was going on vacation perfect timing considering the weather is now cool enough i dont need it but i still want to get it working while we can take our time,1.0

i had to use this place once before and had met with the lady and she was really great and she got me a place so i went back needing another place and move on to another area i was hoping that they would have a really great service i spoke to chris jones and he had made an appointment for that weekend i felt a little off because of the fact that i told him i was moving in 6 or more months and i wasnt sure if i needed appointment right away he was extremely insistent so i was like ill try it anyway so then the day before the appointment he texts me and says are you coming in for your appointment i thought it was kind of rude but i let it slide and i said no youre mistaken its for the following day so then the following day i go in for my appointment and i was already kind of feeling like this probably wasnt a good idea i go in and right away he assumes that we had talked on facebook or craigslist this guy had no remembrance of our conversation previously during the week so at this point im frustrated because i know this guy is probably full of s if you cant remember a conversation 3 days ahead of time and if you cant make a correct appointment time somethings not right so im very blunt with my answers and then hes asking questions about my income how much i make and what im looking to move in at i told him a price range and right away hes giving me these facial expressions like like im rude or im being unhelpful i told him isnt it your guys job to help me find a place why would i look at apartments in that price range on my own and then be here so i knew this guy was given attitude and i was going to give it straight back so i was like you know what its not going to work out and i walked out right away he crumpled up my paper application into a ball this guy put off such a f attitude there was no reason for me to be nice back im sorry but if you cant f get your clients together and remember s then why the f would i want to use your service plus i did not see one single woman working in that office its like they fired all of the women and it was all some stuckup arrogant assholes running that f s needless to say two or three years ago that location was running great now i wouldnt go there if they were the last person on earth dont even get me started on how they were trying to s on another lady and tell her they couldnt find her a place for 1000 a month this girl had money and they were f shiting on her i think they turn into a bunch of scam artists so dont even bother here,0.0

please do not visit this clinic i started seeing dr ahn late last year for epileptic seizures and im sorry to say that my disorder has gotten worse since then i take my disorder seriously but unfortunately she doesnt she rushes me out takes no time to address my concerns or symptoms and is dismissive about my care indeed at my last visit she failed to give me the results of an eeg that she herself had ordered even though i brought it up dr ahn has failed to prescribe appropriate medication she had me taking a high dose of medicine even though i suggested it might be too much for someone who is relatively small and already taking a hefty dose of antiepileptic medicine it was only after i mentioned feeling groggy and having memory loss that it occurred to her to take it down a notch ultimately the stuff she gave me didnt work out as i ended up seizing anyway she suggested we should up my dosage and when i declined she looked at me like i was nuts and asked why i wanted to get off the medicine so badly um clearly because its not working lastly her availability is ridiculous i chose to see her because she comes out to my area once weekly yet its impossible to get an appointment because she fails to make trips out here ive now resigned myself to making lengthy trips to the chandler office just for the sake of being seenim now tapering off the meds that she gave me sadly my epilepsy has gotten worse i have constant shaking and tremors review too long heres all you need to know avoid this clinic avoid dr ahn she will only make you worse,0.0

oh wow it was amazing first off the view is amazing  the restaurant is situated such that it overlooks the bellagio fountains headon theres an outdoor seating section and unfortunately we were seated right next to the door and it often got stuck  not a lot of people bothered to close it so we had the summer heat constantly blowing on usabsolutely make a reservation before you come here i think i saw them turning people away in front of me we started with the caprese  absolutely delicious but im probably biased because this is one of my favorite all time dishes the dishes come out one at a time by the time youve finished one theyre usually pretty good about making sure the next one has already been placed on you time if not the next 2highly highly recommend the burrata we also had the cold cuts plater because who doesnt love some dried meats  as far as pastas we ordered linguine al pesto gnocchi alla romana funghi trifolati and agnolotti di vitello other dishes ordered were polpette di carne and capasanta alla putanesca scallops my favorite dish was hands down the gnocchi alla romana  tasted like butter and the texture was fantastic in all honesty i would order any and all of the pastas again i am absolutely planning to come back,1.0

subs so slow youll starve before they get there this location in particular is literally only two right turns right down mineral point road less than a mile on the same street to my workplace yet it is always an average of 40 minutes before i get my delivery order how is that even possible i could walk there faster than that i always have to remember to order my lunch well before im even hungry for it if my work was in a weird location i guess i could understand but were literally right down the street from them i love that jj has online ordering but this location has to step up their game their subs so fast youll freak motto is a joke if i could give this location less than one star i would,0.0

overall 5 stars  the service was outstanding at this helicopter tour company  the wife and i planned a helicopter ride from las vegas to the grand canyon with a champagne picnic inside of the grand canyon we were picked up from our hotel in one of the companys limousines on time  we got checked in for our tour in a timely manner also  there was a short safety briefing and then we were off to our tour  it was a cloudy and rainy day  our pilot assured us that if he thought we were in any danger he would turn around right away we got some good looks at the strip hoover dam and lake mead  as we headed over to the grand canyon we got turned around because of bad weather in the grand canyon  he told us that we wouldnt have been able to land in the grand canyon because of the weather  we still had a great tour with a lot of sightseeing  the pilot let us know that the company would take care of us and either reschedule or give us a refund  when we got back to the office they were very professional and helped us get a full refund  we did not have too much time in las vegas so we couldnt reschedule once everything was cleared up they gave us a ride back to our hotel in the limousine again  we technically got a free tour  i would like to thank sundance for their help with everything and hopefully we can rebook our champagne picnic next time we go to las vegas,1.0

tam and kim assisted us with the sale of our home i felt very comfortable and confident that every t was crossed and i was dotted they were both there to answer every question i had and im a pretty inquisitive person  i cant thank them enough for their professionalism and their dedication to us through a non typical transaction having had many real estate transactions over the years their care and response is definitely not a typical experience so my opinion is  do yourself a favor use a team that cares and is there for you at every turn real estate transactions are stressful enough having this team was our blessing ,1.0
i came here thinking that this place was somehow affiliated with firemen like the dentist was a retired first responder or somethingturns out he just admires firemen which is why he decorates his office and building like a firehouse  the irony is that he is anything but admirable  i guarantee everyone that walks through his door gets an overpriced treatment plan even if they are simply coming in for a cleaning  i came in for a cleaning and was told i needed a lot of work done including replacing my back crown that was less than 2 years old  i told him no way and once i left i never returned  funny i go to the dentist every 6 months and my new dentist has never made mention of any of the problems this dentist conjured up  ohand i was already upset because they had just done a number on my fiance but he can leave his own review and when i went into the back room they told me they would like me to reschedule because i was in a bad mood  i laughed and told them i dont think so i have been waiting for 45 minutes you can see me now i said i wanted to speak with the manager after i was seen because we needed to get the issues with my fiances account resolved and they assured me that i couldconveniently when my appointment was over the manager was out to lunch dont waste your time on this place,0.0

this place has the potential to be an awesome bar  sadly after a few times being there i honestly dont think it would get better i do give props to 1 bartender but thats about it as far as music and drinks its very mediocre the service from the servers is extremely horrible god for bid theyd actually have to pay attention to their customers  i rarely do  reviews for bars but i feel like id have to get it out some way because it was obvious that my server being rude and inattentive was not going to get noticed by the manager after getting a pool table and waiting a good 30 mins to get food and drink order our server finally came placed our drink and food order and completely rushed it out of us as if she had a time limit to get the order in 10 pm on friday when we finally got our food we realized she forgot our nachos after finishing all of our food we told her she forgot our nachos thinking maybe it was already made and she can just run it to us but she just went and put the order in and before that i asked for  simple glass of water she looked at me dead in the eye and said sure ill grab that but then continued to go sit at her own table with co workers to eat and dance to the god awful music they had playing i really wanted to like this place because of the amount of pool tables they have but the servers could use a whole lot of common sense and training,0.0

don and john and crew have worked on my audi many times and my daughters honda crv once so far  im an engineer and something of a car nut and when younger did just about every small job myself brakes water pumps etc so i can follow most of what they tell me  i have found them to be honest and trustworthy and recommend their shop without hesitationmy audi had a recurring issue centered on the secondary air injection system causing the cel check engine light to come on and preventing me from obtaining my annual state inspection i replaced the electrical air pump myself once only to find that the problem came back import connection not only fixed it for a reasonable price but when it failed again under warranty a few months later they replaced it again next they did my timing belt and other major maintenance 90k miles for about half the price of the dealermy daughters honda also had the dreaded cel code p42  i replaced one of the o2 sensors myself but it didnt cure the problem  import connection measured the airfuel ratio and found it was way out of spec the fix was a valve adjustment job 260 which corrected the airfuel mix and the cured the cel problem again if youre looking for an honest shop i think youll be happy with this one  as always do your homework first and get second opinions i think youll come back here though i hope that i wont have to go back soon but will if i cant do it myself,1.0

based on yelp reviews i decided on piestewa peak as my first hike in arizona and absolutely loved it  i was looking for cardio with a beautiful view and that is exactly what i goti went solo on easter sunday and was pleased that quite a few fellow hikers joined me on my mission to take on the summitt  in my experience i found parking to be a breeze  the people were all friendly and the people watching was hilarious  be sure to bring plenty of water since it really is a trek and if you can fit it bring your camerait is worth the extra effort,1.0
this is about as gross as you can get it smells horrible and utterly  flithy avoid this hotel  but seriously  it smells disgusting and its nauseating another tragic feature or lack of feature is that there are no curtains to close when you want to sleep or undress the entire parking lot can see into your room  sadly  there was a street light right outside of my window that was shining in my room and it was really hard to sleep see pic,0.0
my cousin told me about national fresh foods and experience since my first discovery a few months ago i came back here almost every other week  my children like the sushi there because it is fresh but not pricey  my husband likes the dim sum there so i ordered take out a few times for my family and guests  my youngest son likes some of their baked goods tooi like the meat seafood and produce departments they have so may choices when it comes to asian foods  they also carry some tropical fruits which are not easy to find in the regular canadian market  sometimes they have exceptionally good deals in meat and produce departments  i rarely leave the place without filling up my two huge costco bags  so guilty being a big spender at the asian super market lol,0.0
my friend and i are both chefs and just got off work and my friend who was a loyal customer for 6 years recommend we go here for dinner i was early and the service was great i got a drink and my chips very fast once my friends got there we ordered margaritas with an extra shot and they tasted like limeade not 1 drop of tequila so we sent it back once we received our margaritas again nothing changed it we couldnt taste any tequila we ordered our dinner and it took forever to come out literally about 30 to 40 minutes we went through atleast 5 bowls of chips and dip the buster oscar was the only reason we didnt get up and leave and he is the only reason this place is getting 1 star oscar was very engaging and entertaining he made us laugh and made our whole night once our food came i got the tacos de carne asada and it literally had no flavor or seasoning it tasted like i was chewing rubber i had to put guac and ton of salt i even dug in my margarita to get my lime to give it some taste we were highly disappointed and to top it off my friend who is retired military and has been getting a military discount for the last 6 years they refused to give it to her because she wasnt currently active duty we complained to the manager and he wasnt the most friendly or considerate of all managers wasnt much help at all he did reluctantly give us a military discount the food was mediocre the service was decent the management was horrible id rather spend my money on taco bell but oscar is amazing thats the only good thing about this place i will not be coming back and i doubt my friends will either,0.0

the vdara is one of my favorite hotels when i visit vegas they are a nonsmoking nongaming property owned by the mgm group and i prefer to this hotel for a couple reasons while most people go to vegas to go crazy and unleash i prefer to unwind and the vdara is comfortable and allows its guests to go out for fun or have a good time but come back to a calm and peaceful enviroment to rest the rooms here are beautiful and offer great rates in comparison to other vegas hotels rates the beds are comfortable the rooms are spacious and the property is quiet you dont have to worry about being woken up all night long by loud music or deal with drunk people passed outside the door to your room because this hotel while not the most expensive is simply classy and they offer great amenities and services this property offers awesome customer service a great location and modern touches which are overlooked or simply outdated at many of the older properties,1.0

we went shopping the sat after thanksgiving  an annual tradition for myself mother and best friend the deals were great and we were able to get a huge pile of clothing that was where the fun ended for us the service was atrocious in so many ways they made us feel unwelcome and acted as if we were bothering them while we shopped the women working in the store began vacuuming at 540 despite a 6pm closing time and turned off the lights on us in the fitting room at 550 between the 3 of us we spent 52800 in clothing they made a previous sale for 15 and there was only one other couple in the store so we knew things were slow despite the fact that we were first in line they served the other couple before me they apologized only to the other couple as though it were out fault they didnt know how to work the register we waited patiently but things only got worse after finally ringing us up one of the employees was refusing to punch the discount card after a 322 sale  stating she already punched it and implying that we were being deceitful we were so offended  the other employee even told her it was not punched but she continued to rudely refuse finally  in a huff  she punched the card slammed it on the counter and refused to speak to us when leaving we still wished her happy holidays in spite of her behavior and she just walked away the service spoiled our evening and marred our tradition  what a shame,0.0
saw multiple reviews on this place saying this is the best burrito in town so i figured i was in the area and would give it a tryyou can actually order online and pick it up at the restaurant if you are ever in a hurry and didnt want to wait i came on a thursday evening around 6pm there was no line and no wait basically ordered my food and it was ready in around 10mins or lessthe menu is posted on the wall very small menu for choice but good enough for what they offer you can choose your burritos with chicken mango chicken pulled pork steak vegetarian halibut or they also have ones with 2 meats in them like chicken and steak etcthey offer 2 sizes a small and large choice between white or whole wheat tortilla at first when i was the bag that holds the large i thought it would be small but as i saw them put the burrito together they definitely dont cheap out on the ingredients they give a handful of ingredients that go into the burrito as well as a big spoon on guacamole usually most places will charge you extra for guacamole but this place didntif you want it hot they put a good portion on jalapenos and hot sauce which makes it quite spicy the size which it came out to was fairly big i shared half with a friend and im glad i did because it filled us both up well the cost of it was around 10 which was a good dealwill definitely be coming back if were in the area and wanting to save money on a filling meal,1.0

6 jan 2011 800am accepted delivery of my new inglis gas dryer from the best buy located at 3820 s maryland pkwy las vegas nv 89119 delivery guy 1 removed old dryer and allowed me to clean the area delivery guy 2 brought the new dryer in i watch the delivery guy 1 hook up the gas line and exhaust vent hose after he was done he pushed the dryer against the wall and crushed the vent hose i told him that and he said it is ok i told him no its not the hose should not be crushed like that reluctantly he moves the dryer forward and fixes the vent hose i also ask him why did you fully extend the vent hose the vent hose had two 90 degree turns i tell him the more twist and turns you have in the vent hose the less efficient it will be and increases the chance of a lint fire what he should do is fully extend the hose and cut off the excess so that it is short and straight as possible he gives me the same reply it is ok i get tired of trying to explain common sense installation procedures and let them leave typical i dont care its not my problem mentality like most people have nowadays after they leave i go behind the dryer and push all the excess vent hose length back into itself and straighten the hose so that it is as short and straight as possible which is what the delivery guy should have done i plan on installing a rigid metal vent to replace the flexible metal vent rigid metal vents are recommended for best drying performance and to reduce the risk of lint fires i am very disappointed with this installation next time i will spend my money elsewhere,0.0

we thought this would be a good place to stay but it turned out to be terrible we came in for a wedding and this was the hotel chosen for all out of town guests since most people were flying in the location seemed convenient and we were excited to see it had a little kitchenette in the room however once we arrived we were incredibly disappointed i called the day before and was told check in was at 3pm but to call in the morning because sometimes they can get you in earlier we arrived just after 3pm and headed to the front desk to check in the young lady there pulled up our reservation and said our room wasnt ready yet i expressed my concerns since it was already after 3pm and we wanted to get into the room before the reception i asked if we could be put in another room and she said she was fully booked and i quote the housekeepers arent done yet and we have a large property i cant tell them to hurry up she assured me it would be no more than a 30 min wait i went back to my car and waited we were not able to get into our room until 5pm that is ridiculous the next morning we went down to the front desk for the grab and go breakfast that was also another disappointment when we entered the front desk lady was too busy gossiping with someone else to even acknowledge our existence as we searched for this so called breakfast when she decided to take a break in her conversation she told us to look in the cupboard where we found one nature valley granola bar needless to say we left hungry later that afternoon we got some news and we needed to head home we told the front desk that we would need to check out early and asked if there was anything they could do about the charge for the second night we explained how we were unhappy with the experience overall and we werent able to get into our room until 2 hours after check in this lady at the front desk each time we spoke to someone different was very rude to us she said it wasnt her problem and she couldnt do anything about it she said check is from 3pm forward or whenever your room is ready she didnt offer a discount or any compensation what so ever so as guests we are held to a certain time standard as far checking out but the hotel can do whatever they want without any concern for their guests i will never stay at one of these hotels ever again and i will strongly recommend to all my friends and family that they never stay here as well for those ladies who worked at the front desk remember you are working in a customer service industry meaning you need to deliver good customer service so incredibly disappointed,0.0

on sunday they are supposedly opened until 930 but when we called they said they closed at 9 because they were busy so we politely asked if its okay if we made a reservation at 830 and they said sure so when we got there they had to go ask the boss if we could be seated after she said asked we got seated after we got seated we got constantly reminded that they close at 930 the service was alright after we ordered and gotten our food but then around 925 they handed us bill and asked us if we could pay first so that they can settle the computer which im fine with i understand that they just want to close and go home so we paid first and we continued eating until 925 which we were once reminded again that they closed in 5 minutes so we finished up eating left a tip and then left right as we walked out the door one of the workers walked out and rudely said you can keep your seven cents first of all we left a six dollar tip for them secondly im upset and angry at how we were treated we were rushed and rudely treated if i had a choice i would rate this no stars for their rude service,0.0

by far the best healthclub in the north scottsdale area outstanding staff top notch equipment and very responsive management take a tour and you will be impressed but its the community that you become a part of that really is where the value is we love the village update sadly the quality of this place has gone down markedly since we joined untrained young employees and a high turnover rate combine to make it a frustrating experience at what should be a premium health club for the price expect to be irritated if you come in when the personal trainers are running a class  you arent able to use large parts of the equipment in the gym personal training classes take priority and you will be  unceremoniously told to leave that areawe were getting updates as to golf expansion plans they have meanwhile the day to day experience at the actual club is falling apart and nobody seems to be in control of it when my brother was visiting from california i called the club the night before and had two mountain bikes ready for us to get on a ride before it got hot in the afternoon  we showed up early bikes werent ready one was missing a pedal and when i pointed out that the tire was flat on the other i got handed a bicycle pump outstanding once i finished pumping up the tire and we actually got going it was already an hour later then we had planned all the time wasted switching bikes out and trying to find a nonbroken one was the only cycling experience to be had that day my motherinlaw was visiting from out of state when we took her to the clubs spa for a scheduled manipedi the staff had some kind of issue with their staffing going on and took it out on my wife and motherinlaw who were obviously so upset they left and didnt go back the cook they had working for them for a few months used foul language within earshot of us on the balcony while we were trying to eat our food im not trying to detail every bad experience we had here but to give potential members an honest recounting of the sort of issues we experienced on a constant basis being members,0.0

dose moving came across as a company that brings newer trucks and lots of packing supplies having gone through a terrible experience last time when the movers exhausted all their blankets half way through wrapping my bigger furniture i was especially cautious of that dose did not disappoint me in any way their entire crew was really good and they had plenty of packing supplies especially their crew leader jim came across as a very careful person and attentive to details he as well as rest of the crew namely victor luis aaron and chris all were very friendly and super careful in loading and unloading stuff jims presence certainly made a difference overall i had a very positive experience with dose moving and would rehire in a heartbeat for my future moves thanks a lot guys,1.0
went to steak for my anniversary and it was one of the best dining experiences that my wife and i had we were seated on the second level over looking the restaurant which was so chic and was like being in londonour waiter was on point with everything that night which made our dinner that much better our meal started off with the bread mmm the bread plate which had three types of breads then the coolest thing of all they brought out a cart of different types and cuts of meats and explained each one of them to us we ended up getting the ribeye and the beef wellington which they split in two for us so that we can share we got 2 sides to accompany or ribeye and they were the asparagus and mac  cheese and trust me when i say that you will not be disappointed if you order these sides and if you are looking for a sauce to go with your steak i would try the peppercorn sauce which was to die for i have to say that everything that we ate was so amazing and so delicious it brought our taste buds alive i will be returning for sure,1.0
i had a wonderful manicure here from a lovely nail tech she did a great job and was very friendly i had a dinner reservation in mandalay about 10 minutes after the manicure was supposed to end and she did it just right on time i got gel and it was only 5 days ago but my nails still look great very impressed their services are not cheap but its a high end upscale spa on the strip in delano the quality of service was worth the premium price,1.0
there are only 2 things i can recommend about this buffet  the view of the flamingos and koi pond which is just gorgeous and our server who was attentive and friendly and thats the one star sorry folks usually i try to find positives but this one pissed me offthe food was just so subpar im still astonished anyone goes there of course there were a few items that were ok they were making fresh soft tacos to order but this was the mothers day dinner and at 2595 which i believe is more than their usualthis is it for freshly prepared entrees no crab no fresh shrimpsighok the chocolate fountain was good but the neon green cheesecake weirded me out  i have to mention decor because it was just so tired and dated the presentation of the food was straight out of the 70s truly just keep looking at the lovely garden and animals and dont think about the money youve wasted on your meal,0.0

i love dicksuhhhhby this point ive probably had everything on the menu twice over there are so many dishes that are both varied to please everyone and still consistent with what they are going for which is the new mexican cuisine dicks has it all a quaint and unique atmosphere it feels like a small eatery youd find in a downtown of a big city its a really fun dark kind of sexy place to take a date too there arent many better first date localesthe pork chop chorizo roasted garlic plate red white and blue enchiladas and of course the carne adovada are some of the real standouts for me they serve chimay on draft the servers are friendly and its got the fun great atmosphere to boot you owe it to yourself to try iti just hate telling people i had dicks for dinner,1.0
for a new pizza place in the area it was dead on saturday night  that should have been an indication to walk away  but i wanted to give it a try and the cashier was super friendly  i ordered take out and it took 40 minutes for them to prepare a small 10 all meat pizza and an order of ravioli  money would have been better spent on digiorno and chef boyardee and the preparation time would have been quicker  although it was packed with meat it was probably one of the greasiest pizzas ive ever had  the middle of the pizza should be reserved for those with castiron stomachs and a handful of tums  the ravioli were stuck together and the sauce was borderline pure tomato paste very thick  ravioli were poor in taste and texture  i think they were covered in the same sauce as used use on the pizza but with meat added  speaking of the meat that was the only thumbsup i can say about the place the meatball used on the pizza was pretty good  not cheesy and bready and i believe it was the same meat added to the ravioli sauce  id love to get my money back for this meal but i will never step foot in the establishment again  i cant imagine they get a lot of return customers  i give it 90 days and that store should be closed  since its las vegas ill make a bet on it,0.0

best rib eye i have ever had  and thats an understatement the black pepper crust on these steaks is unreal makes the meat infinitely better the meat is tender juicy and every bite is better than the last they cook the steaks to the exact temperature you ask for and the service is unparalleled do yourself a favor and ask for ricky ricky is the man he provided us with one of the best table experiences we have ever had such a gentleman addressing us with yes sir yes maam everything he suggested tasted amazing we would come back here for ricky and for the black pepper crusted rib eye pswhen he suggests the famous 24 layer chocolate cake dont say no even though you think you cannot possibly eat another bite like ricky says you wont regret it,1.0

im a sucker for homemade ice cream so im not really sure why it took me so long to try this place out but better late than never it has such a classic ice cream parlor feel to it the flavors are quite unique such as lavender red raspberry or chili chocolate i got the chili chocolate and i am in love it sounds intimidating just by the name but the spice elevates the chocolate like you wouldnt even believe upon first bite you cant taste the spice but it kicks in a little afteri really like that a familyfriendly place like betsys has such unique ice cream flavors i will be back again and again,1.0

came in for dinner so it was pretty empty took a second for the hostess to greet us but once she did she promptly sat us at a table near another family we waited and reviewed our menus and waited and waited and waited the table next to us had a waiter come over multiple times we had no one even bring us water several other workers were standing around wandering around and whenever i tried to make eye contact with one they promptly shuffled away forget it after 20 minutes we got up and left hostess didnt even inquire why we were leaving never again will i set foot here i dont mind a bit of a wait or slow service if its understaffed or busy but come on,0.0

we went for drinks but got harassed by the staffi went for a drink with a couple of friends after we had dinner somewhere elsewe have stated at the door that we are only here for drinks not for dinner we were welcomed and seated then the drama started when the first girl introduced her self as our waitress and took the orders she asked if we want to eat something and we said that we are only here for drinks my friends asked for beer so it was easy but i made the mistake to ask for whiskey the waitress didnt know what whiskey they have and after a few minutes she came back with a small piece of paper with the names of 3 brands only i chose chivas drinks came on their own no nuts no chips we said fine can we order nuts and chips and we will pay for them but the waitress replied we dont have but you can order food even though we mentioned in the beginning that we are only here for drinks a couple of minutes after another waitress introduced herself and said that she will be our new waitress and asked if we want to eat something we replied no we are only here for drinks her smile got smaller and she left but surprisingly she appeared again shortly after asking if we are sure that we dont want to eat something pushing everyone to our edges because it became very annoying the biggest surprise was when she was replaced by a third silly young waitress came asking if we want to order some food wtf  we are being harassed in a very annoying way and we are paying for it with what we believe is tactic of the management to make people spend more money we left very upset because we went there to relax but we ended up pissed off this place must remove the bar sign and keep the restaurant sign if they cant accommodate bar customers and must respect all customers no matter if they are there to have a couple of drinks or a full mealwhile we were leaving a young gentleman named andrew asked how were things so we expressed our opinion and he gave us a card that was sitting at the front desk stating 20 off if you spend 40sometimes you can repair the damage but sometimes you can and sorry this time it wont work because they really spoiled our saturday evening,0.0

i have been to this restaurant several times in the past year  the sushi was always fresh and delicious  the all you can eat offer was a great deal and a main reason that i continued to patronize this restaurantwhen i went last weekend i was informed that there is no longer the all you can eat option they now have a 30 dollar fixed  menu option  the reason for the bad  review is that the quality of the food was so poor this time that some of the food was not even eaten by the group i was with  everyone in the group commented that the food quality was poor and none  of us would ever return  sushi sai was a nice restaurant but it is time to find a new sushi restaurant,0.0

stopped for breakfast not too hard to find  the vines growing around the door make it stand out in the strip mall it is a darkish three room place with great music from the bar area and muted tvs showing sports throughout seating is community table style it had a great vibe and menu the dishes featuring chilis are truthfully advertised as smothered in chili sauce i dug out my huevos rancheros but when i return will ask for the chili sauce on the side so i can control the volume coffee from roc2 was out of this world while the restaurant has their own blend i recommend going out to cave creek to tour the roastery and pick up coffee unfortunately it is not open on sundays and the whole foods we visited was sold out so i will have to order from the website,1.0

one of the worst experience i have ever had with my nails i walked in for a manipedi and they took me in immediately they were so impatient and wanted me to hurry up picking up the nail paint the lady attending to me did an ok job on my feet but she ruined my finger nails i kept telling her that the tips are rough and not neat at all but  she didnt listen to me nor did she reply back she just kept uttering something in a language unknown to meplus in order to get that right she just kept adding more coats on my finger nails the nail paint started coming off within an hour i was so disappointed with the service i usually go back to the salons if something goes wrong but i knew there was no fun here,0.0

what you get for 751 an uninformed 90 minute lecture about the history of taste and alcoholic beverages  this meandering speech had my entire group tuned out after about 15 minutes  the next hour and 15 was excruciating  2 a personalized tasting that ended up being the same for most people despite our difference preference which he spent 30 minutes writing down on a piece of paper and then another 30 minutes ignoring  3 5 sub1 ounce drinks that were worth maybe 10 if that  we are taking 2035 bottles of scotch  the best scotch poured was black bottle a 35 blended scotch available at bevmo  2 of the 5 scotches were so bad that they were undrinkable  they were supposedly in the tasting because they were distinct and we were not meant to like them take your money and go to a lounge andres at the venetian for example and buy 34 high end pours of your favorite stuff  this place was the biggest waste of time and money over our last vegas trip and thats coming from someone who lost 100 playing craps,0.0

a definite must while in vegas my friend had the hookup to put us on the guest list its a bit confusing as to where to go but we found it once we arrived it was packed with the music blasting a good mix of hip hop  edm not really a fan of edm but with how everyone was i didnt mind it my friend rented a locker 25  it was so worth it had all of our stuff in one area plus a charging station right in the locker so you can charge your phone while you play theres a main pool  a smaller pool right next to the bar pineapple express was tasty it comes with multiple straws so you can share with your squad there are also cabanas  lofts you can sit on around the pool was crowded but in the pool it was easy to maneuver around be careful when entering the pool though i stepped down  didnt realize how deep it was  almost fell over i accidentally hit the girl next to me honestly everything about tao was just great vibes  everybody having fun love love love it,1.0

decor is cute and the lighting was dim which i love so it does have a bit of a romantic vibe the hostess was very rude and placed me at a table saying absolutely nothing i waited forever 9 minutes i was alone and very aware of the time for a server in an almost empty restaurant they took my order and never came back i actually had to get up and ask for an additional glass of water i ordered a filet with gorgonzola cheese and it was the saltiest steak i have ever had the fingerling potatoes were equally salty it was awful for the price i could have pretty much went anywhere and had a better meal or two i should have known better since it is a chain the food and the service make this a restaurant you can miss out on for sure,0.0
first they had to change the keg no big deal then they said they were out please order another beverage then after my meal was delivered they show up with my original beverage order the burrito was cold the taste was mediocre the cheese was cold and not melted and all that for over 15 bucks not including the beverage wow i commented that it was cold colder than my draft beer and the waiter said im sorry and walked offnever again i only gave them a 1 star because the app wouldnt let me submit it with no starsi understand they are busy  but that is what they want quality control and customer service is completely absent,0.0
my parents finally came through albeit belatedly with my birthday dinner there was too much going on during the past few weekends for the family to get together tonight i had been wanting to try pan asia for some time as its been around for quite a while but sis was still under the weatherso we got takeout yes japanese takeout i even had sushi i didnt even know that was possible let alone gastronomically correct but hey they offer chinese also so it cant be that much of a sin we had ourselves a feast of feasts so a list is in order shrimp egg rolls fried pork dumplings beef skewers beef fried rice chilean sea bass for dad singapore mee fun for mum sesame chicken for sis gyoza volcano roll i think there were 6 total and seafood yaki udon by the way the last 3 were my picks but we all sampled and shared like family should what you doing my family were perplexed at my picturetaking yelp guys yelp my mothers eyes rolled my father groaned my sister laughed mom asks that isnt why you wanted takeout from pan asia for your birthday is it ummmhe reviews everything on that goofy site dad adds shaking his head not all of what we ordered was dynamite but nothing was inedible the gyoza seafood dumplings according to the menu were tasty enough but were also lacking in culinary character or distinctiveness just what was the seafood anyway and the beef skewers were somewhat dry but thats where my very minor criticism ends everything else from usual chinese fare like the sesame chicken the beef fried rice and the pork dumplings to lesstraveled for me at least japanese offerings like the seafood yaki udon won the evening the yaki udon noodles were as bulky as bullrope yet soft as butter and were utterly crowded by shrimp scallops crabmeat and a colorful array of fresh vegetables the sushi rolls were tremendous and along with all else we brought home held up well sushi has been getting a backlash like cupcakes currently are theyre trendy flashy but damn it sushis pretty damn toothsome not to mention filling the volcano rolls had salmon avocado a burningly arcane hot sauce and capelin roe masago all wrapped up in a rich heavy wad of supple white rice i dont know if any of this is authentic i dont care if any of its authentic it was just stomachstuffing excellence and while were on this tack take my fathers chilean sea bass an alchemistic  nectarous sauce as sytgian as demons blood coats a swollen filet of that which rivals lobster the fearsome looking patagonian toothfish and with your first luscious fallapart bite you have found zion i was envious of my father but alas there was too much for him to eat alone and too much else for him to try so barter we all did just so we could try what appears to be pan asias optimum dish every one of pan asias detractors need to try this dish as far was the remainder goes the pork dumplings were yet another great example of that staple of appetizers the sesame chicken was triumphantly tender and candied the beef fried rice was quite tasty with its generous chunks of meat and ideal rice and dear mothers singapore mee fun was a titillatingly tangled mess of oriental goodness so out of 10 dishes there were 8 winners and 2 alsorans that were not at all dreadful how could i not give them a 5going back to the takeout aspect each menu item we ordered was packed expertly all of it fitting tidily in a box and arriving at the correct temperature i often take this part of dining experiences for granted but will no more if pan asias takeout was of this high quality eating in must be extraordinary that can only mean one thing chef wen chun yu is a true champion of the kitchen and deserves your dollars this area is no wasteland ignore anyone who tells you differently if and when i visit the restaurant i shall shake mr yus hand and thank him personally for the grand smorgasbord he made for my family and i,0.0
went there for the first time last night  i had a groupon and took my family out for my mothers birthday  lets start out with the positive  our server was extremely friendly and helpful  we were the only ones in so we received all of her attention  the cook in the back was also friendly  now for the bad  the food was beyond terrible  we started off ordering 2 orkas  they were very small amounts when the came out and not the portion size of other restaurants i saw a similar review saying the same thing before  i agree  when we talked about ordering the 2meat combo the cook said there were two ribs per meat so we would get 4 ribs total  food came out with only two ribs and the waitress apologized that it was a misunderstanding and only 1 ribs per meat again with the small size of the food  i ordered the 3meat combo bbq chicken rib and fried chicken  i received one rib a chicken leg and a very small fried breast that looked more like chicken fingers  now the really bad part the rib was cold not a little cold but right out of the refrigerator cold  i tried the mashed potatoes and they were the same  frig cold  my son ordered wings and they were also cold  we sent it back and i could hear the microwave ding when my food was heated up  wow  the waitress and cook later apologies for serving cold food  he was in a hurry to get all of our food out so he missed a couple plates  again  wow  if i wanted leftover food that had been cooked hours maybe previous day before and reheated in a microwave  i could have bought a frozen sandwich at the 711 on corner and used their microwave  this was the worst meal my family and i have had that we could all remember  just terrible is all i can really come up with as a thought  the bill was 60 for two 3meat dinners 2 okra wings and 5 drinks  way over priced even if the food was good  which is was not  let me end on a positive note about the server  she was apologizing throughout the meal and did give all of us free deserts to go  she invited us back to try it again  i will have to pass and would recommend that you pass on this restaurant as well,0.0

im giving this place 5 starts simply because its just straight up good the place isnt meant to be a large fast food or fancy date night type of spot it has 3 tables and has a cozy vibe to it enough options to please everyone my ultimate favorite is the vegetarian thali which also comes in nondairy since im intolerant to lactose  the gentleman who served me was very polite and took the time to ask me how the meal was super affordable and two blocks from home most importantly place is clean no need to spend too much for a quick hearty meal two thumbs up,1.0

we recently had our sons birthday party at this place  in all honesty i was a bit skeptical thinking itd be quite boring with not that much to doi will say i was very wrong this place was great  the staff had adjusted all the equipment to gear more towards the party goers age and they were great with the kids  i figured this would be a 90 minute crazy kid fest with children bouncing off the walls like racket balls but it wasnt  the kids got to play for about 30 minutes like racket balls then the staff had a whole bunch of organized games which lasted about an 45 minutes or so  the kids really enjoyed the games and it really kept them all very involvedat the end we did pizza and cake which we had to provide they provided paper products and juice and the kids had about 20 minutes or so to eat  we were the last party of the day and to my surprise we werent being pushed out the door  the staff were very patient with us getting everything out and didnt seem to mind that we were there 20 minutes after the party was supposed to finishi was really pleased with this overall and would certainly recommend it for a party location,1.0

this is the best sushi restaurant ive found in newmarket its my goto place for sushi takeoutthe place looks a bit small and unassuming but its nicely decorated well lit and very well kept its not one of those places that focus on decorating and theme but a place that focuses on the food and one can definitely see that service is also very good and staff is always very friendly whenever i go therethis restaurant focuses on the more basic and traditional sushi varieties they have a large variety of sushi and do have some more exotic rolls but its the more traditional stuff that they do best the sushi here is well made and very tasty the rolls do not fall apart between your chopsticks like most other places in town they also make good tempura and teriyaki and a very good tasting miso soupbeing a fan of sushi and having looked around quite a bit for a good sushi place i can say this is the best ive found in the town of newmarket i recommend this wholeheartedly for people looking for good quality and great tasting sushi,1.0
all the great reviews really are true about this place the fish is amazing the calamari is a must the shrimp is good but peeling it is kind of annoying and the salad is great the waitresses are helpful and smile a lot the gentleman at the fish station are on a mission to know what you want however if you are friendly with them and crack a joke they tend to enjoy that the food really tasty and cooked well i was so full after my meal and i really enjoyed the experience i cant wait to go back and try new fish,1.0

we have to use towing companies to transport our machines on occasion for trade shows we were able to get one locally to bring over for the show as opposed to having to transport it from our plant in casince i have had many experiences with towing companies it is easy for me to give a comparison to others this was one of the best experiences that i have had as well as one of the least expensivethe drivers were prompt and courteous as well as genuinely concerned about the piece of equipment that they were haulingi wish that i could recall the first drivers name but i can not he was a former rocker that was now into gospel music the second driver was tony who moved from maui to las vegas i am going to guess that some of the negative reviews here are due to the people being upset about having their car towed when they were not expecting it to besince this was a planned tow i can tell you that this company ranks up there in service with any other company that i have usedshould we be in need of a tow while in the vegas area i would not consider any other company that ewing brothers,0.0
i have recently started this company cleaning my 4 homes  what i like most about this cleaning service is that they send you a quick survey of how they did with smiley faces or frowns  if your not happy they will send someone out immediately to clean and fix what was wrong  also they can switch out your cleaning people for another team if needed  i love maria  humberto because they do such a great job and you can smell the freshness when you come home and walk through the door  they are super friendly and always ask if there is anything specific that i need done  you can also leave a note or list  i cant say enough about this team and hope that they never get too busy to clean my homes  ,1.0

experience  came here with a group of folks to try out taco tuesdays ive been here many times before and this is my favorite bar so i guess it deserves a review finally facility this is a very eclectic quirky fun bar  the artwork is weird but makes for a great conversation piece every time i come there is outside seating in front of the bar in case you want to people watch everyone on fremont there is bar seating directly inside and even a few booths  out back there is an amazing private garden and this is my favorite spot  it has greenery cool art and a fireplace there is even a small smoking area behind it with a working heavy duty see saw for grown ups we sat out here because it was a pretty nice evening but for those that had a chill they even had those portable heaters that look like a light pole to move to your table service  most of the time i have great service here  with our big group last night there was one waiter that was a little pushy about clearing the plates i appreciate someone asking is there anything i can take but he kept specifically asking for each plate on the table can i take this then on to the next one can i take this when people are talking and drinking they tend to pick so just leave the food he even went so far as to say in response to someone saying is there still some in there as he was removing itits cold are you going to eat it like that well not after you called it out at the whole table like thatanyway besides that guy the staff is courteous helpful and attentive food and drinks  they have this yummy grapefruit beer i get every time i go i started out drinking the 1 beers on special last night but be warned they are only 7oz mini bottle beers they are so cute though they said they ran out of dos xx so they served sol instead then they ran out of sol and they magically had dos xx again lol anyway i ended up switching back to my grapefruit after a while we ordered the 2 tacos which were small but pretty tasty especially after i ordered some jalapeos to top them off with then we ordered a mix of appetizers from the happy hour such as garbage fries fried pickles and mac and cheese balls all of them were good bar food the garbage fries are really good with a bunch of topping such as cheese fresh jalapeos avocado bacon and a sunny side up egg on top yumoverall  i love this bar between the cool atmosphere good bar food and grapefruit beer i will continue to come back,1.0

i would give them a zero but it wont let me  this place is an absolute rip off i took my car for an oil change and to get the ac checked  i had called there other location the day before and they told me they do  ac checks for free and depending on the result it was up to me if i wanted to get the service or repairs done  long story short after they supposedly ran free on to check my ac they told me i had a small leak and it would be 400 to repair  at the time i didnt have the money so i told them i would come back another day  when i went to pick up my car they told me i had to pay 100 just for checking my ac and they went on by feeding me all this bullshit about how them checking it and using there free on to check for leaks was all worth the 100  i took it to another mechanic and they told me they never even added the free on to check for leaks because if they had done so the ac wouldve blown cold for at least a day or more depending on the size of the leak  it never blew cold which means they never even lifted a finger to check it yet they charged me 100 i doubt they ever even did the oil change smh so people please be aware of this place it is an absolute scam ran by lazy mechanics,0.0
this is the kind of place that draws you in before you even walk through the doors and old  white house with pub painted in big red letters across awesome i have been frequenting this establishment for years  and it has almost ways been fun the only time it wasnt was when some patrons hogged the pool table upstairs and wouldnt let anyone else play however aside from that  the service has been great i love their pizzas and their emphasis on locally brewed beers also beware the goldspur drink it cautiously  or you may have your worst hangover the next morning,1.0

warning i ordered takeout from here last night and have been super sick since i ordered one rainbow roll one spicy tuna roll miso soup and garden salad 24 dollarsand an upset stomach later im terribly regretting my decision this is the only sushi spot around me so i looked at yelp saw they had decent ratings and placed an order now i will admit  they were super speedy they told me it would be about 1015 minutes i was happy to hear that i arrived and the guy at the counter was super pleasant and even told me that he would recommend dinner menus per my suggestion i got home opened up my bag and looked at my meal at first glance it looked fine i took a few bites of the spicy salmon and it didnt taste anything like it then figured i would move onto the rainbow roll i dont know who made these rolls but they should be fired the fish tasted old and i should have known better to keep eating it but i was really hungry i love sushi and never complain about my orders but i promise you i will never step foot back into this place the fish was paper thin and tasted like it was dragged across a dirty floor im thoroughly disappointed with my experience and caution others from ordering the sushi there,0.0
the food was delicious i ordered the fish and chips and it was so moist on the inside but crunchy on the outside the pepper jack cheese bites and the pretzel sticks with cheese were great the server was friendly patient and helpful with our large group of 10 i would recommend you check this place out its a wonderful place for families or for date nights,1.0
last night i brought my sister to manitoba for her birthday dinner immediately we were greeted by a kind waiter who offered us the option of sitting at the bar overlooking the kitchen or at a table after explaining it was my sisters birthday he recommended the bar as a fun experience despite being a wednesday night the restaurant was busy and the chef came over to us right away to explain that there were groups of food bloggers coming by the restaurant for about 12 hour he apologized and assured us that it wouldnt take over the whole evening despite the crowd the fantastic service continued the waiter serving drinks was able to offer recommendations and gave us a bit of history on the drink we had selected gin  jam was a delicious cocktail as we looked through the menu the chef came over to us again and offered to create our menu for us he assured us that he wouldnt blow the budget which was kind and asked us about any thing that really interested us or allergies being pretty adventurous eaters we gave him carte blanch and were thrilled with the resultwe tested a variety of appetizers from the menu first a comforting cup of cauliflower and corn soup which hit the spot followed by oysters that were incredibly fresh and delicious we were then served an unbelievable pasta dish with smoked sturgeon and brussel sprouts followed by the lamb terrine and duck hearts the duck hearts is not something that i would typically order however the dish was so delectable and we were happy that it made the cut the lamb terrine was flavorful and had a fantastic texture leaving evidence of the lamb rather than the often pureed texture found in a terrine as our main the chef served us the venison steak with a potato rosti and the most tasty carrots i have ever had the steak was perfectly cooked and extremely flavorful without being overly gamey we ended our meal with both the chocolate terrine and the sunflower cake both offering such amazing taste and texture combinationsthis restaurant offered more than just incredible food the service was impeccable and the whole staff made us feel welcome and like they were cooking for us at their home the chefs displayed an obvious passion and understanding for the food that they were sharing with their customers with each dish came a simple explanation which made you appreciate the food that much more throughout the evening we had watched the chef making the pasta and meticulously peeling the brussel sprouts and the result was well worth the tedious job each dish was prepared with attention to detail and in watching how much time and effort went into each preparation there is no doubt that your meal is worth every penny you will leave this restaurant with a overwhelming desire to return and try the rest of the menu items but also a sense that you want to return to a place that offered a welcoming and relaxed dining experience  i would whole heartedly recommend this restaurant and cant wait to return again soon with a seasonal and local menu i cant wait to see what will be offered for the winter selection,1.0

i took my yorkie to mkb for basic obedience training when she was a puppy and i was not impressed with dorothy nor her training methodmy dog was the smallest dog in the class and dorothy constantly picked on her calling her a spoiled princess repeatedly and using negative training styles which neither i nor my dog appreciated  i have since trained her at positive reinforcement classes and she has done great  she loved the positive reinforcement classes and picked up the skills very quickly  in dorothys class my dog did not even learn to sit  she was terrified of dorothy and the punishments  my dog has a sweet temperament and has never met a soul she didnt like except dorothy  we dropped out of the classes midway through and switched to another training school and it was a great decisionperhaps if you have a big dog this class may be more suitable for you  i felt that dorothy had a negative attitude toward small dogs,1.0
food is everything it was hyped to be clear sharp flavors and in particular the texture of the meats was just perfect boneless duck crispy fried to perfection luxuriously melting short ribs that still didnt taste greasy and dry sausage that was redolent of chiles and limeservice was very good and our waiter knew the menu inside and out answering every one of my questions the service is also very fastthe inside of the restaurant is nice enough  not modern or hip in any way but nicer than your average thai the location is straight ghetto but never fear youll be accompanied by a steady stream of taxis limos and others making the sojourn this many blocks from the strip its not a secret this placethe only flaw  a minor one in the scheme of things  is that the prices were a bit high for the amount of food ordered the portions are quite modest you will need to order at least one entree per adult and possibly moreis this the best thai ive ever eaten i dont know  it was pretty darn good and a lot of the dishes simply arent available at your nearest thai joint experiment a little  this is not the place to get panang curry and pad thai even if they happen to be really goodthis is a definite keeper and well definitely be back next time were in town,1.0

i love love love oreganos  when i lived abroad i was terribly homesick for this place and to be honest the thought of living further than an hours drive from oreganos puts me into a panicthe food is delicious and generous and the prices are super reasonable  the alfredo the dark with chicken is wonderful and my staple  i especially like the roasted poblano chile on top which oddly varies in degrees of hotness depending on the day  there was one time that i happily snarfed the pepper only to realize a minute later that my lips were on fire  like i had to ice them for the next 20 minutes  still i take full responsibility for that silliness and recommend that everyone be very careful when eating those little guys  the salads are great the belinis are yummy the staff is crazy friendly which would usually annoy the hell out of me but i find it oddly endearing  sigh i cannot wax poetic enough,1.0
this place is amazing a wonderful hole in the wall with utterly delicious and unique food in the vegas valley i ordered the meat and cheese pasty it was cooked to order and the crust was tender and flaky the filling the interior was so yummy it was good enough without the red wine gravy but if you know whats good for you try that gravy its like noneother ive had before a hip casual place with a great beer selectionplus blackthorne cider on tap now i thnk i have a new place to nosh for a great meal,1.0
just stopped by this little place for lunch and loved it we frequent this shopping center a lot and have tried almost all of the restaurants in here in our opinion the best food can be found in this little part of the shopping center between az kabobs and mr mesquites there is no need to go anywhere else the tortillas were fresh and delicious the steak had a nice mesquite flavor all of the ingredients were fresh and they had a salsa bar to top it off the staff was friendly and everything was nice and clean i imagine if they keep up with their quality ingredients and cleanliness they will be a very successful business,1.0

in contrast to the gladstones claims that their karaoke is the best in the city at most its now nothing more than a selfimportant kj with very little stage presence but lots of rudeness putting on some songs this is a very different vibe from the days when peter styles presided over the stage with his flash black tieish attire and his famous applause sign that he would hold high behind a singers back to pump up the crowd why they got rid of him is a question that defies comprehension but i will say that theyre right in calling this latest incarnation shameless karaoke as one would need to have some semblance of shame to continue on with this pale copy of the glory that once was karaoke at the gladstone,0.0

awesome food and great service  the water tasted weird so the ownermanager came out and personally apologized and offered us free sodaswe are usually a carbonated drinkfree family but it was awesome that a business owner was so eager to accommodate his customers we also liked the atmosphere  it was simple but clean and didnt smell like fried food like what ive experienced in some small restaurants  we will definitely be returning they also deliver so i know where my family and i will be eating on our lazy days,1.0

after reading some questionable reviews from know it all nit wits i would like to say that my sister and i have been loyal patrons of shogun for many years you will not find better sushi in toronto that is a fact the prices are very reasonable considering the level of freshness quality and culinary skill while i can see that the servers sometimes might not be what toronto foodies may be used to keep in mind that the waitresses actually prepare and put together a lot of the appetizers soups and much more themselves they are also very friendly and very accommodating i have yet to find a restaurant that has served me with the consistent perfection that shogun has shown over the years,1.0
i drive an old 94 jeep wrangler that has well over 200k miles and still going strong because i keep up on maintence with quality parts and since  i am a former professional mechanic i do all the work myself about a week ago i had my tires rotated and noticed my rear brakes were soaked in oil i needed my brakes replaced right away but i work night shift and didnt have time to do it for another few days so a quick search showed brake masters was the closest to my location but closed in less then an hour i called and explained what i needed done and they told me to bring it in and they would stay late to get it fixed i got there at about 5pm and they got my jeep right in and started checking out what needed done they close at 530 and would have stayed late to get the repairs done but my brake drums they couldnt get until the next day so i opted to leave it overnight and had them replace the rear wheel bearings seals brakesdrums and oil change they had all the repairs done by 11am the next morning and i couldnt be happier with the service i am very selective who i let work on my jeep and these guys at this shop have earned my future business for all of my vehicles,0.0

i think that even giving this location 1 star is being generous being a first time parent i appreciate all the customer service i can get ive gone into this store several times unfortunately due to necessity but there were 2 crucial trips there where i received zero servicefirst crucial visit was to shop for car seats no help no acknowledgementsecond visit to look at pack n plays was on a weeknight where service was slow barely any customers but several employees on the floor we asked for help twice with absolutely no success id much rather drive my ass to brookfield wi and visit buy buy babyget this store under new management please,0.0
i had pretty much every burger in almost every restaurant  this one of the one of the best sunnyside burger and truffle fries i ever had and the service felt like a five star restaurantand  i applaud the management for training  their staff  very very well hats off to a server carlos great experience thank you,1.0
excellent customer service however i went in for a tire repair and i was told my tire was unrepairable and i needed to buy a new one i ended up leaving and going to discount tire where they repaired my tire for free bottom line is if youre a female go to a different repair shop or there may be a possible chance that you could get bamboozled ,0.0

highly recommend by far my favorite pizzeria since we moved to the area i can honestly say that i enjoy this pizza more than some of the pizzerias in ny where we originally lived the slices are massive and very filling the sauce is amazing we have also ordered wings and the wings are absolutely delicious the only thing i wish they added on their menu is chicken rolls because i love chicken rolls and it is a common thing sold in pizzerias but unfortunately they do not make them,1.0
this place is huge it has a great selection of all kinds of interesting items including a mayonnaise makerwho knew they used to have to make that by hand we thoroughly enjoyed wandering the aisles and peering into display casesso much so that we ended up spending about 3 hours here my husband found these cool i call them creepy canisters and an awesome old lamp i found a sewing machine drawer old pencils and some old games and jewelry we will definitely be back next time were in the area,1.0
avoid this hertz at all costs  i rented a car for a couple weeks and was charged almost 400 for additional insurance even though i specifically told the employee i believe her name was kim that i had my own car insurance and did not want to purchase additional insurance  when she gave me a quote i asked why i had to pay additional fees as i booked through orbitz  she assured me that this was just a preauthorizationdont worry about it itll be removed once you return the card  she seemed a little sketchy but it was almost 11 pm and i was exhausted and decided to trust her  2 weeks later i returned the car and the attendant notified me of a nearly 400 charge  i told him that the employee assured me it was a credit card preauthorization but he explained to me that it looks as though she charged me for additional insurance  i went upstairs to talk to a customer service employee however the line to speak to someone was extremely long  there was however a employee bryan who was monitoring the lines  i explained to him my situation and although he was nice he said that he could not reverse the transaction but would contact the employee and would contact me within 2 business days  4 days went by and i heard nothing  but the 5th day i called the number he requested that i call and was given the run around  i spent 2 hours on the phone and spoke to 34 different people who kept transferring me to another person  they seemed completely apathetic  finally they transferred me to a employee in lost and found  she was confused how she ended up with my call  i told her my situation and out of everyone i spoke to she was the most understanding and said she would speak to her manager  an hour later i get a phone call from bryan who said that he did speak to the employee kim and that she doesnt remember you but she said she never overcharged you  to which i replied if she doesnt remember me then how could she possibly make that statement  the conversation lasted almost an hour and it was like talking to a broken record  he repeatedly said that there was no way anybody could reverse the transaction  i told him this was bs  he then admitted that this issue has been a problem and they are attempting to resolve this overcharge issue  but regardless there was no way for me to get a refund 10 minutes after i got off the phone with bryan i receive another phone call from him  he said he spoke to his manager even though when we met he said that he was one of the managers   he assured me that he would put in a request for a full refund  2 months later i get a refund  but it was to no surprise that i only received approximately 35 returned  and to this very day i continue to get the run around and no one returns my phone calls this was a complete rip off  buyer beware even if you tell them you want to use your insurance some of the employees there apparently will still add on the insurance plan and you will be charged for it  im not sure if the employees get some kind of perkcommission for overselling but its pretty obvious that they have shady policies  i have utilized almost every car rental company in the sky harbor terminal yes even the companies one would think would adopt sketchy practices and i have never encountered an issue like this before  it is absolutely disappointing in addition to being completely unethical,0.0
i went here needing help with carpet and they helped me out so much so many places to choose carpet from here in vegas and i would come back here hands down they exceeded my expectations for sure thanks guys,1.0
taste wise this is easily one of the best new places ive eaten at in quite some time  smoke is very easy to miss  hard to find as its on east 8th avenue which is the main road that runs through homestead  its not located in the waterfront areai absolutely love this place  its very informal inside as there are only 4 tables and a few seats at the bar and you pay your bill at a register   this place definitely needs to expand which i think it will  the demand for the food is way too high for a restaurant this size and every time ive been here there were double the number of people waiting than there were eatinganyways to the food  the menu is simple with 8 or so different tacos all soft tortillas on the menu  there are a few sides and a few specialty drinks  ive tried just about everything on the menu and everything was amazing  i really dont know what else to say   everything tastes fresh and is not overly seasoned or salty reminder  if you eat here you must try the mac and cheese,1.0
i would give them negative stars if i could i bought a 500 toshiba laptop and a 1200 dell from this place both absolute rubbish the toshiba died after 3 months of use and the dell died after barely 5 months of use same error for both unmountable boot  error the geek squad guy was awful when i took in the toshiba and was very condescending as if i was some sort of idiotim an engineering student in my senior year so i know a little about technology he said he would fix it for 300 what he said i must have done something to it um i dont think so i have a 7 year old hp that still works decently that i bought from office depot yet somehow both the laptops from this store seem to not work and show the same error this place is a scam i am positive they sell refurbished junk at full price i will never shop at best buy again nor will i recommend them to anyone,0.0

ive lived here for over a year and watched people struggle in the parking lots i just got off the phone with rita in the office discussing the parking lot repavement which is unnecessary but to my surprise they had no game plan for the extra residents that would be left with out parking for the price u pay to live in these cheap poorly crafted apartments they should be paving the roads for us but instead we get cheap free breakfast every piece of equipment is broken in the club house and careless management they have no problem taking ur money but when u need help rita in the office will give u attitude i cant wait to move to a place that recycles,0.0

nope never again i got a bloody burger why is well done so difficult on top of that its a cramped place they are trying to fit far too many tables into square footage that makes it feel cramped uncomfortable and stifling on a positive and my only reason for the one star is the drinks were good and our server was awesome still wont come back though,1.0

i seldom give any business or organization a onestar review  when i do i try to make sure that i do so dispassionately  unfortunately this is one of those timesi visited this church a few times but i found the teaching to be shallow and very much entertainmentoriented  entertainment has its place but it most certainly is not what worship should be about  the teaching lacked depth which is what typically happens when the focus is placed on making the church entertainingi also visited a couple of their singles groups on several occasions not once did anyone in these groups bother to say hello even when the singles pastorleader specifically urged everyone to introduce themselves to the newcomers  i mentioned this to one of their members and he said well you have to understand the people here want to spend time with their friendsas i said i seldom give onestar ratings and i do so very reluctantly  in this case though i honestly cant give them anything higher,0.0

i was very happy to learn that this store was under new ownership and that the pushy and condescending former owner rob was no longer there so i decided to go in and check it out after vowing never to return after my bad experience with that rob guy im glad that i did this store is right on my way home so it is very convenient for me to pop in and get the items i need i also noticed that their selection of brands have increased and the prices are now competitive with the bigger vitamin stores plus all that creepy spiritualvoodoo decor is gone and the store is now bright and clean the new owner was friendly and went out of his way to help me find the items i wanted sorry but i didnt get your name but will next time unlike the former owner who talked down to me and tried to push expensive products at me as if i was an idiot i do have knowledge of vitamins and supplements so i can very happily say that this is my new go to place for all my supplement needs,1.0

omg how is there more than one of these places the appetizers were decent calamari and bruschetta i ordered wings which i previously believed would be difficult to mess up boy was i wrong they messed up wings and they messed up wings horribly  the skin of the wings had a look as though they were just reheated and has sauce thrown on top  we got the kids pizza which looked like bread with cheese and ketchup on it i could do anything to convince my kids to choke that downthe kids meals usually come with an ice cream not at turtle jacks you get a rice crispy square  they charged us an extra 2 for a sundae granted it was with whipped cream and sprinkles lol  i also had the skor brownie which was not too badthe service was nothing great she was sometimes hard to get but was always on top of the pop refills  friendly but not overly soi went to the restroom and one stalls door was broken and couldnt lock and didnt look well maintainedunless its a night of just drinks i think ive had my last visit here  i feel like this meal is eating me back,0.0

this was the single worst experience i have ever had at a medical facility  on february 21st my husband and i went there when i broke my foot because there are never any cars in the parking lot and we didnt want to wait in an urgent care office or er at the peak of flu season  we were ushered right in  no line no waiting  i told the male nurse that i had a phobia of getting my blood pressure taken i have a full blown panic attack and he had to confer with the physician whether i could be treated or not because of it he came back and did a pulseox and said we didnt have to have a bp  i waited another 30 minutes for the doc who came in  never even introduced himself stuck his stethoscope to my thick sweatshirt for one second that was the most ridiculous thing ever  he didnt hear anything through that shirt in that time and why he needed to do that was beyond me  i had a broken foot  he rudely said ok well get you an xray and left  i waited another 30 minutes  there were no cars in the parking lot no one waiting in the waiting room  i finally peaked my head out and said do you know when ill get an xray  the nurse said anywhere from one to two hours  our radiologist isnt available right now  what  this is supposed to be an er  did he take a lunch break and leave  i complained that time was excessive due to the fact there was no one there  the male nurse said well if you were at banner baywood youd be waiting 16 hours  i told them i was leaving  the only service provided by this facility was a pulse ox  i do not count seeing a doc for one second for one second of pretend auscultation a doctors visit  no xray was done i complained in the survey emailed to me and a rep from your organization called me and assured me that the medical director from the facility would be calling me in the next few days in the mean time i received a bill for 316500 for emergency room 183900 and radiology 132600 and an additional bill for physicians services 33000  what  these are fraudulent charges  i want this resolved asap  i have been on hold for over one hour today trying to call first choice emergency rooms back about this matter  most horrible experience ever and you will not be paid for this,0.0

this place is fantastic seriously we stopped by here for a nice snack and we ended up having a darned fine meal i had a hot sandwichsoup and my girlfriend had a special chicken salad sandwich both were excellent and keep in mind im not really a sandwich guy but these actually made me want to pick up stuff at the store to make them more often the soup was awesome it was a pumpkin soup with small piece of pumpkin in it delicious warm and earthywhile we were sitting down one of the people who worked there made it a point to stop by and ask if we needed anything as it just so happens we had our eyes on a piece of lemon pie so we mentioned that to him he told us that hed take care of it vanished and almost instantly appeared with it back in his hands i gave him so cash and he returned just as quickly with a receipt and my changea few minutes later someone else stopped by to check on us ill be honest i was pretty impressed with everyones friendliness and with the quality of the food i would never really consider coming to a place like this like i said im not a sandwich guy but after two visits here making such an impact im thinking that itll have to become a regular stop thanks,0.0
great service from this company  we called at 8 am when they opened due to our kid soul car windows being smashed at a la quinta hotel the night before he  quoted me a little under 500 bucks to replace the back window and drivers rear side window he said come at 930 and well be ready for you we went and he replaced everything within and hour and vacuumed most of the glass out from the vehicle the price was the same he quoted  fast and efficient friendly service definitely recommend,1.0

my husband and i moved to monroe a few months ago we have officially settled in and found our favorite restaurant  i love the atmosphere you can show up dressed to the nines or in jeans and a tee shirt and feel totally comfortable  this place is beautiful clean and huge the parking lot was completely full we had to park next door but it only took a few minutes to be sat  then thats when our dinning experience really began our server christina was super friendly and knowledgable she had no problem guiding us through the expansive menu my husband had the stuffed flounder which was delicious and i had the spiro chicken that was topped with goat cheese it was fantastic we walked more like waddled we were so full through the restaurant checking it out we were impressed we ventured downstairs to the oyster bar that is more laid back we decided to try that next i hope you do yourself a favor and check this place out if you get christina youre in for a real treat but to be honest all the staff was very friendly,1.0
if you are in vegas just go here i wish i could give this place more stars everything about this place was wonderful the atmosphere is fantastic the seats are comfortable the customer service is top notch and the food literally brought tears to my eyes we ate until we could eat no more and both of us had multiple drinks we walked out for about 6580 with tip i fully expected the check to be over 100 and wouldnt have complained it is was my husband and i travel a lot and we dont tend to go to the same place more than once on a trip but after our first experience here we just had to come back the 2nd night was just as good as the first the waitress remembered us and made us feel like regulars  which is rare when you are from out of town the food and drinks were just as good as the night before and the owner even came and chatted it up with us for about 10 minutes just because he liked us i have never felt so sad to leave a restaurant it felt like we were leaving an old friend i wish i could pick this place up and move it to seattle probably the best all around restaurant experience we have ever had,1.0

i have been going here for about a month and i am not satisfied when i first joined the gym i signed up for a welcome class the trainer i was suppose to meet with texted me  130am stating that he was not going to make our meeting  9am because he had to do a training i understand things come up however i found out when i went in that morning that he was suppose to let me know a week prior when he first found out i was not happy especially getting that text in the middle of the night when i was asleep then i scheduled a time to meet with a different trainer so i can get set up with biweekly sit downs for nutrition plans and workout tips i got the email confirmation and was there for my scheduled time i showed up and the trainer was not there they told me to sit down and theyll get a different trainer for me to sit down with i said i would be on the treadmill waiting if they could come get me when they got someone i was there an hour and a half and nobody came and talked to me either to reschedule or to have a sit down with someone else for the icing on the cake i have a 25yr old and an 11 month old that go to the gym daycare and i had to call ahead each time to reserve a spot for my infant for both of these meetings that did not happen i live in north mesa and would make the 30 minute drive because my toddler enjoyed the childcare area however within the last week i have been pulled off the floor on 3 separate occasions because my toddler was being picked on and bullied and no adult was by her to stop it so she took matters into her own hands and bit the kids nothing was done to the other kids for hitting my kid my daughter was the only one punished and she was sticking up for herself because no one was there to say no for her the kids that keep picking on my daughter are a couple years older than her an know better which is also unsettling i am not getting what i am paying for and i refuse to ever bring my kids back they are the main reason i made the trip to this gym and i have had nothing but terrible experiences with myself and now my kids i will never bring my kids back here this place is an absolute joke i would not trust having my kids in the daycare there are way too many kids and not enough adults,0.0

45 starswent here to celebrate a project with a colleague of mine last night  let me tell you  we ate like kings  we started with the barrata and grilled squid which were amazing  the barrata was served on top of sliced cantaloupe side of mustard and bread  everything worked well individually but together was magic  it kind of reminded me of nonnas my girlfriends nonna but i consider her my own too house when she served proschiuto with cantaloupe and boconccinimmmm yummy  the grilled squid was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth  as our secondi we got lasagna and i have to be honest nonna makes the best lasagna hands down but this reminded me of it and if it can do that then i am truly satisfied it was seasoned and cooked perfectly no complaints there at all  as a primi we decided to order the baseball cut steak and arctic char  i preferred the char more because i can get a steak anywhere to be honest  now what got me with the char was that it did not remind me of nonnas but instead my mommas  she used to make fish and have this tomato topping just like seven numbers  i was thoroughly impressed with this resto from its decor staff and food   its definitely a resto i will come to more often because it felt nostalgic eating there and not to mention the girl working there was very knowledgeable and friendly  i recommend this place to anyone looking to enjoy italian cuisine if you are either home sick or just want some quality food that reminds you of you family  ask them for the chilies in oil if you ever goamazing,1.0
my fiance loves italian food i had just moved from louisiana to nc i was tired of eating olive garden all the time so he took me to frankies i really love this place its a beautiful scenery inside we go here often but on special occasions it takes me back haha i wouldnt recommend a first time visit on valentines day,1.0
if i had two more hands i would give it four thumbs downthey should change their name because this is an embarrassment to a chicago classici have been living in chicago and dining at giordanos since i was a child  35 years later i moved out to arizona after retiring and to my surprise seen that they had a giordanos pizza needless to say that i had to stop by there withe the family since they had never heard of the place  the pizza was gummy on the bottom and lacked flavor ok i said every one makes mistake i had them refire it gummy the second time too almost like raw dough i gave them a second tryabout a month later i ordered ahead arrived there to have another gummy un cooked pizza to top it off it didnt taste good again i took a frozen heart togo and made it in the oven it was good and the next day the left overs were amazing somehow last week i went back to chicago and dined at giordanos with my family to give them a true experience and we absolutely loved it i really wish that the owners of the original giordanos would take a visit to peoria and see how they are ruining an amazing creation i beg that the people highest up on the chain sneak in and try they pizza because it disgusting and making everyone who stood behind giordanos for year seem like idiots for praising it so much   the customer service was awesome the bartender was awesome the restaurant was clean and looked awesome,0.0
holy smokesfor starters i had a tequila and mescalbased berry cocktail that simply blew me away with the unique and interesting flavour fusions as a canadian i felt it necessary to sample and judge the poutine although by no means a traditional type of poutine the dish was amazing im a sucker for duck so i may be a little biased could have used a few more cheese curdsatmosphere a little dark and dank for my preferences but aside from that i have nothing negative to say highly recommended,1.0

do not rent from this company  we have had nothing but bad experiences with them from the day we looked at the house  it is a very nice place and very new however they will lie to your face and do whatever it takes at the time of showing to get you to sign up with them  there was no stove or fridge when we looked on april 23rd we were told that they were being ordered and would be in the residence by the time it is ready for renting  also we told tommy thomas dimaggio that we had two dogs and we asked what was needed for extra deposit  his only answer was that it would be a 150dog deposit up front and that was it  we talked about other companies tacking on fees for any little thing and tommy insisted that this company doesnt do thatha  once we were accepted we were given a laundry list of added fees including an additional fee each month for the pets  i inquired about this and was given the runaround about how it is on all of their postings  so i looked and couldnt find a single one with it listed then their story changed to it is on the lease well we hadnt been given a lease at this point yet so yet again their story changed to it is stated on the application online  in any case their pet deposit also is not such it is an additional fee which is not returned at any time  i called several times over the course of the next couple weeks and every time i only got messages and no one ever returned them  it came to our movein date and i showed up when the office opened to drop off our check and pick up our keys just to be told that we need to have scheduled an appointment for their move in process  of course the supervisor at this office heather does absolutely nothing but apologize profusely but will give nothing for assurances that things will be any different  so we get to the house and surprise there are no new appliances  i am told by tommy that i will be getting a call to set up the delivery  well i did and sears was to deliver stove and fridge the following day  i sat at the empty house for three hours when i finally called sears to see if their team had been running behind just to find out that the delivery had been cancelled  i was out of town for the next couple of days and i contacted their corporate office  about the only thing better is that they answer the phone when it rings  other than that they do nothing more and the second time i called corporate actually started getting scolded because it was my fault for not giving the local time enough time to resolve this matter  wow from the 23rd  the 15th of the following month isnt enough time to get appliances in place  there are many other issues with this company but that is the biggest so far  we have yet to have any type of positive experience and we still havent moved in yet,0.0
this was our favorite meal together yet we came tonight to celebrate our anniversary and were completely spoiled by the staff we were provided a personalized menu with our names on it and one signed by the chef our server frenchie patrick did an amazing job explaining the food options and ensuring we had the best possible experience our favorites were the shrimp and grits and the steak we love the creativity of the menu and the fact that everything is local to nc the drinks are amazing as well we decided to try the i trust you and both loved the drinks the bartender concocted towards the end of our meal we were even provided champagne and two take home cookies to top off the celebration will definitely return,1.0
paid for a wash and wax job on my vehicle and received the car with trash dirt and crumbs still on the seats and on the floors the floor mats werent even in there back the way they were supposed to be they sprayed armor all directly into the speaker so it dripped out of it when we opened the door the vacuum job was a joke and they said they dont clean the inside and the dog hair would be too difficult to remove which is understandable but leaving behind the basics is unacceptable i do not recommend this car wash if you want to have your car washed they clearly over charge for a half job,0.0

as mentioned abe is no longer thereand thats too bad  i will never take my shoes here again  they are disorganized and have very poor customer service  here is what happenedi took three pairs of shoes in for repairs  i went back two weeks later after they said the shoes would be ready  i picked up two pairs  i had to wait about 15 minutes for the second pair because they did not shine them like they were suppose to  furthermore they could not find my third pair of shoes  the guy who runs the place now a short middle aged hispanic man  told me he would look for it and get back to me  he said he had to speak with the person who took my shoes in when i first brought them  a week passed and he did not call me when he said he would  i called them  they still had not located my shoes  again the guy who runs the place told me he would look for them and give me a call back  another week passed and again i never got a call  so again i called them  still no shoes  i told him that he needed to do something about the fact that they could not find my shoes  that i was tired of waiting four weeks had passed since i had dropped off my shoes  he asked how much my shoes were if i had a receipt and what brand  i told him that i didnt have a receipt and that i did not know the brand  who still has a receipt for a pair of shoes they bought a year ago  and i dont pay attention to name brands  i just buy what i like  however i did know that i paid about 100 for the shoes  after i told him this again he said he would call me back in a couple of days again he never called me and i had to call him  he told me he would only compensate me 30 for the pair of shoes that they lost citing some law stating that without a receipt he only had to compensate customers for 2550 of the cost of the shoes  i asked him what law he was speaking of and he didnt say  i told him i would speak to an attorney to get some information about my rights and that i would get back to him  btw  if you are an asu student you can get free legal advice  about 10 minutes after that last conversation i get a call from the same guy i had been speaking with the whole time and guess what  they found my shoes  i went to pick them up the same day  i was happy they found my shoes  however i was also upset at the way they handled the whole situation  the guy who runs this place now never called me when he said he would kept telling me he would look for my shoes only offered me 30 as compensation never apologized or felt bad for loosingmisplacing my shoes and putting me through what he did and i did not get my shoes back till more than a month later after threatening legal action i would not recommend this business to anyone,0.0

my husband and i have gone to this location twice with a decent experience just now we went in an attempt to pick up dinner for the kids and ourselves once inside it took about a minute or so before anyone even looked up to acknowledge us eventually a gentleman manning the grill told us someone would be with us shortly after about 2 or so minutes a young lady came to take our order we were ordering 3 items but i guess since she only saw two of us she assumed we were only ordering two items my husband had to reiterate that we had a third item to make she basically ignored us and proceeded with only the two items we figured maybe since she started the two she was going to finish with those and make the third which didnt make sense i have to say that on first impression of her there was no hello no smile the first thing she said was what did you want to order she seemed to be either in a really bad mood or she hates her job the final straw was while she was trying to roll the burrito a good amount of the filling was bursting out onto the foil what did she do after that she kept wrapping the burrito into the wet mess we are supposed to eat that with our hands we felt frustrated with how we were being treated and it seemed our moneyorder didnt matter so we left i have never done that before but that was simple unacceptable horrible horrible service,0.0

i would not recommend this dog care facility to anyone i went into their ajax location on kingston road two weeks prior to book my puppy koda in for an overnight boarding i had an outoftown wedding to attend  they marked koda on the calendar for a one night overstay and informed me i would need a bordetella vacine which i had done  i called them a week prior to confirm koda was signed up for sure and they said yes and i asked them if they could send me the paperwork to fill out to save us time on the saturday when we drop off our puppy the girl said we could come in anytime to fill our the papers so we did on the tuesday night at 4pm and to our surprise there were two girls there one gave us the sheet to fill out and the other girl said oh no i wont be here for one dog i have the weekend off  she then called over to their other location on finley and got the owner on the phone to talk to me and she informed me because there was only one dog koda booked it was not worth paying a staff  member so she gave her the weekend off but i could bring koda to her finley location and he would be all by himself with no one there but she could monitor him by camera from her house can you imagine not acceptable so i was out on a limb if i had of brought koda there on the saturday  morning the place would have been locked up  they dont care about our pets only the money so koda had the vacine for nothing at our expense and i had to cancel our plans they have no business ethics whatsoever  kodas mom  whitby,0.0

our housing company sent this company over to furnace clean  unfortunately we know how our furnace should be cleaned since my exhusband is in the business  the loan operator of the truck started by hooking up the large hose to the bottom of the furnace to suck from both hot and cold air returns  these need to be done separately  he did not cover any of the vents  this helps with sucking the dust out of the vents and instead blew the dust into the basement suite he blew out all the vents that were uncovered and finished by doing the main run  my son put his hand on the register and told me there was no pressure so where is the dust going to move  it took him 50 min to do a two story which takes my boys two hours to do the same job  i am still dry mopping dust off the floors and can see more dust particles floating in the air  the air quality is now worse then ever and thanks to this company i have more house cleaning  spend your money elsewhere folks with a reputable company,0.0

homelife protection isnt a good warranty company at all i filed two claims with in one week  the first was the hose bibs to my washer they were leaking  after telling the rep that the hose bibs are leaking cause of corrosion they still send a plumber out which is owned by homelife  he took apart the hoses and called in the melissa the lady that denies claimsand they said they wont cover the claim because of corrosion the plumber left all the parts out and our water off at left when i told him the 240 price was too much money for this repair  i went to home depot bought the part and plumbers tape for 381  with a wrench and elbow grease i fixed it two days later on labor day out ac went out when it was 109 degrees  we called 3 times on saturday and didnt get a call back  on sunday we call the property damage line and got someone on the phone they wanted 150 because it was a sunday i told the customer service rep on the phone this policy is garbage and he said he doesnt want to be verbally abused on tuesday the tech came out and said they dont cover control boards  he wanted 290 for this repair  we are trying to cancel or coverage currently and i am hoping for a smooth process however i cant be optimistic in the fine print of the policy they mention not refunding money if the customer is verbally abusive  i am sure the guy noted i said the policy was garbage,0.0
the care our pets have received at aloha has been simply beyond outstanding i cannot say enough good things about the people who work here  with every visit ive felt confident that they truly care about my animal family and that the medical attention will be the finest available i know this sounds over the top but aloha really is just that goodboth of the drs sulliban have treated our russian dwarf hamsters on several occasions its not that we havent had good veterinary care for our hammies before but in those cases was more a matter of luck that the vet was willing to get up to speed on hamster surgery at aloha they specialize in among other things exotics and it really really shows from the warmhearted women in reception who coo at length over your pet to the assistants who ask all of the right detailed questions as they enter the data into the computer and take a photo of your pet for the file and for the reminder postcards they will send when its time for a checkup to dr jason who takes his time explaining every symptom cause and possibility and answering even the most farout questions i just cannot be more impressed and lets not forget the followup call a few days later just to be sure that all is wellthe facilities are outstanding we went to their open house a couple of years ago and were amazed the boarding areas are thoughtfully designed and yes they do board hamsters and other critters the equipment seems to be high tech and its obvious that the layout was carefully planned from the start to have everything they need just as it should be the design of the exam rooms and waiting area is comfortable and welcoming hawaiian candy bars while you wait i am always touched by the things people have made in appreciation that hang artfully on the walls the surroundings speak of integrity and reassurancei also appreciate that aloha is active in the community such as conducting rabbit education programs for the spca advertising local petfriendly events etcnobody likes to think about money when their companion is ill i tend to be the type who just wants my little friend to be well and happy again even if it means handing over the visa card with my eyes closed aloha has never put my vulnerability to the test though exam fees and medicines are always reasonable and the receipt is itemized very nicely oh and look theres your pets photo at the top awwi cant imagine a better option for animal care in las vegas if facebook had a game called veterinarianville this would be the animal hospital all of the top players would try to create im trying to think how far away id have to move to switch to someone else baker no it would still be worth the trip barstow nope still coming back to aloha san diego maybe but only because the hammies might get carsick or they might get stressed when i yell at other freeway drivers although i like to think that hamsters are with me on my indicators exist for a reason bucko crusadethank you aloha for exceptional care and peace of mind you are the best,1.0

i never got to try the donuts because the manager at this establishment was very rude  we were so excited to try these donuts so we showed up at 7 am on sunday morning because when we called the day before the employee told us that we could preorder and pick up at 7 am  however we decided to just to go right when they open  so once we got there we were greeted rudely by the manager telling us we werent allowed in to buy any donuts since they dont open until 8 am  we then decided to call to make an order on the phone which the employee told us that we could pick it up right away even though they havent opened  so we decided to place the order and were so excited waiting outside for our donuts however we waited for 40 mins and no one came out  we decided to give them a call back and the employee stated that the manager wouldnt allow him to sell us the donuts at that point we were fed up and decided to leave because they were rude and unprofessional  they should have given us a call back instead of making us wait for 40 mins  now i will never go back to an establishment that has bad customer service even if they are rated highly,0.0

wow is an understatement it has been several years since ive eaten at va bene italian restaurant celebrating my birthday with my husband and son on dec 19 was a special dining experience i have no idea what they do to their calamari rings but this was an appetizer extraordinaire there was a special sauce that was extremely tasty but the rings themselves were prepared in a way to make them very soft i have eaten this appetizer at many different restaurants but this is hands down the best they kept bringing a basket of sliced bread with a orangecolored butter that was exquisite to the tongue then the main course of a chicken with fettucine was very well prepared the healthy portion allowed me to take some home and much to my surprise heated up well two days later the server and manager were very attentive also i have no qualms about recommending va bene in ahwatukee for a fine dining experience,1.0
im shocking myself by giving this place a good review  i do like taco bell even sometimes when sober  i guess i appreciate the fact that ive never found anything disgusting in my food and they always have those green salsa packets in stock  service is usually quick or im too wasted to remember how long it took  the taco artists are nice too  props for not ever giving me the rheas for longer than 24 hours thanks guysedit  uhhh what the hell guys  i order 2 food items both with no meat  i get home hungry at 2am and gleefully open my food items  one of them is as ordered but the other is slathered in greasy god damn steaming mystery meat  thanks for nothing jerks,0.0

if i could give them negative stars i certainly would  i was so excited to sign up for a healthy food delivery service for my familys busy weekdays but i havent even received my first delivery yet and im already disappointedafter seeing their ad on facebook i went to their website and everything looked amazing so i proceeded to sign up  the default delivery date showed this friday and i discovered i was unable to change the delivery date to next week as i know i will be out of town this weekend for easter  on this same screen it states you can change the day later  so i went on through the purchasing process  i selected the 129 plan for 12 meals a week which i felt was worth it considering the time i would save during the week  after completing my order i could not find anywhere that would let me change the date  i searched all over the site and the help section with no luck so i emailed customer service with my concerns immediately after placing the ordertheir reply was absolutely shocking  shocking because its 2016 and customer service is key to the success of any business and freshly could care less if they address my issue  they basically told me that the order was already processed and suggested that i donate the food or give it to a friend if i dont want it  i never said i did not want the delivery it just needs to come next week because i will be out of town frisun so no one would be there to receive the order  i cannot wrap my mind around how they believe this is an acceptable reply to my email  im a brand new customer that expressed my concerns about the delivery date 4 days prior to delivery and literally as soon as i placed the order,0.0

i love monkeys and had always wanted to try this place  ive stopped in a few times but the 1215 per cocktail led me on down the road  before our last trip to vegas i found a travelzoo deal for 29 for four 12 cocktails making them just about 750 each so i jumped on it  we came about 8pm on a tuesday night and there were several people in the place  service was quick and i asked if i could order a 15 monkey suit drink and pay the difference  noyou dont have to pay any difference ill include it with the coupon  yes  we ordered two of those and then followed up with a a margarita and a cucumber drink dont remember the name but it was very good  when we went to check out i expected to pay taxes but the server told us were were good  she was awesome and got a nice tip  id visit again but damn that monkey suit was strong   i was buzzed for awhile on just that drink,1.0
a new low even by airport standards  the double drinks were still pretty weak seemed like i was just drinking a 12 single and the pizza was the absolute worst one ive ever had  wouldnt be surprised to find they were frozen ones being microwaved in the next room  i ordered the prosciutto and arugula one  it ended up being a flat tasteless frozen looking cheese pizza with a pile of toppings thrown on top on the middle not cooked onto the pizza  cold on top  the prosciutto tasted like it had gone bad so i ended up just pushing it off the piece i ate  service was really poor too  i was sitting at the bar and it took over 10 minutes to get the bartender to take my drink order  he waited on literally everyone else who arrived after me while avoiding making eye contact  finally he acknowledged me by saying did you need something  do people often sit down at the bar if they dont want a drink40 for pizza and two drinks  never again,0.0

delicious food and great ambiencewe were on a road trip heading south looking for lunch close to the 15 freeway  thanks yelp for bringing us here  we were pleased right off the bat with the warm tortilla chips hot bean dip and salsa as soon as we sat down  were suckers for tableside guacamole which was great as well  the portions were huge  we only needed two entrees to feed me my wife and our two kids  we got the fish tacos and the combination with a chili relleno and green chile pork burrito  my only criticism of the food is that the peppers they used for the relleno were very mild and i like them to have a bit more punchthe kids enjoyed the live mariachi and had fun watching them make the tortillas fresh behind a window in the corner of the restaurant  all in all a pleasant meal and we were back on the freeway quickly,1.0

this place is great  weve been here several times and always leave pleased  i suggest making your own burger or the meat your maker  i usually do the bison meat but the wagyu is great too  the fries with toppings are awesome  appetizers are huge and equally good  we did find the chicken burger a bit of a let down but hey its a burger place  our favorite milkshake is the carmel pretzel but on one or two occasions its been way too salty  we asked and they happily replaced it  the other milkshakes are great too and they can add liquor to any shake great beer list too not huge but quality craft beers  one piece of advice is go early andor with time flexibility  theyll text you ten minutes before the table is ready so we usually go back home or do some shoppingpeople watching at walmart,1.0

so to add to my review the cleanliness is seriously lacking there was urine splashed on the inside of the toilet lid i went to get my shoes from beside the bed and noticed items left under the bed by other guests i was awake much of the night due to the ridiculous noise of that elevator if youre not going to offer in room wifi at least have decent common area lounges for guests i find it very telling that no one asked about my stay upon checking out,0.0
my experience at sura was horrible it was our first and our last time there if i could put a negative star i would we get in at about 335pm and were sat at a table i go to get food vegetable tempura shumai and egg foo young well i take a seat back at the table and take a bite out of the tempura and about to take another bite and thats when i look down at my food and see a hair in my food i pull at the hair and it ended up being a 2inch piece of hair i told the first waitress and she apologized and took my plate away ok so moving forward with our lunch not having an appetite to eat much i go and take a piece of my kim chee and under that piece there was a piece of hair talk about being disgusted i tell another waitress and she tells the owner and the owner comes to the table and was like im sorry blah blah blah then the owner and waitress started to talk in their language and started to laugh looking at the plate talk about feeling like crap as being the customer then the owner goes well it could be your hair that was it i was being so nice and professional with the whole matter after all it wasnt my fault and believe me we have the money to pay for our meal so trying to get a free meal is something i was not trying to do with this happening twice in one sitting i am sure that i will not be returning to this place again trust me it pays off to look at your food so stuff like this doesnt happen and your not eating someone elses disgusting hair,0.0
i normally dont write many reviews but this place deserves one  i was in need of a fill and do to being short on time i couldnt get in to my usual place  i came across this nail shop through google let me tell you i think this will be my new nail shop  bonnie was super  she was very understanding and helpful and made sure my nails looked amazing  i had picked out a pastel coral color and when she went to polish my nails noticed that the color was not setting correctly and on top of that she noticed that my cuticle was making my nails not look to nice  most places would just polish and not care  bonnie cut my cuticle reshaped and buffed my nails and looked for another color in the same family family that would look better than the one i first picked  when it came to checking out i was assuming she was going to charge me for cutting the cuticle and re reshaping my nails  she did not  she just charged me for a fill w gel color  i was amazed and happy that this place cares more about there work than the money  i definitely recommend this place along with the whole staff they are pleasant and care about there clients  super happy with bonnie  thank you again for taking your time on my nails ,1.0

i love the coc everyone knows it the coc is what toronto locals call coco fresh juice  tea by the way im not sure what you were thinking i was saying but you were wrong as usual you have such a dirty mindactually the torontonononians dont say much about coco because its as yet largely undiscovered and definitely underrated which is sad because as chains go and as bubble tea goes its utterly incrediblewhat to get hot milk tea or cold milk tea with bubbleswhat not to get shingles unless youre terry bradshawi can only assume that rivals are writing reviews of coco because its every bit as good as gong cha and sharetea the other international chains that are opening nearby and perhaps in some ways betterthis is an awesome little location of coco the place i first discovered and fell in love with in queens nyc where they have several excellent locations i first tried the hot version of their perfect lifechanging milk tea here in toronto and it was utterly divine my travel partner not the cat actually thinks its better than my fave sharetea and my 3rd fave gong cha i put coco in 2nd place but theyre all very very good and comparable and the milk here is gentler and creamier somehowawesome little place ratings are inexplicable delicious hot tea,1.0
we went to slate bistro while visiting some friends in pittsburgh  what a great meal  every appetizersalad entree and dessert was outstanding  the fried calamari steak not the normal rings and baby squids was amongst the best ive ever had as were the scallops though being that they change their menu very frequently i cant say theyll be there when you go  and the desserts  the key lime cheese cake and the nutella mouse cake were amazing  add this place to the list of things i miss about this great city,1.0

im a huge fan of tendou it is my new favourite soft serve spot uptown they only do two flavours for now  matcha and black sesame both of which are amongst my favourite all time flavours of the two i actually prefer the matcha which is ultra smooth and has that slightly bitter matcha taste that i love it really reminds me of authentic japanese matcha the black sesame i find is not as creamy and smooth but makes up for the inferior  texture with bold delicious sesame flavour i actually would not recommend getting the twist because i find that the black sesame dominates the matcha flavour and the two are not exactly complimentary i like to enjoy the 2 flavours separately i have been to tendou many times since it opened and i know i will keep coming back for more,1.0

i stayed downtown for three nights and two of my dinners were l here that tells you something they have an allyoucaneat offering on tuesday nights after 6 pm its 2895 for 1 hour where you can order off a special ayce menu that doesnt include everything on the standard one but has some things that arent on the regular menu sadly the photo i took of the ayce menu came out blurry and i was going to rely on it to list everything that i tried and liked ill save that for the update since i am going again next weeki sat at the bar where brian and carlos prepared all of my dishes brian was particularly nice in putting up with my lame non foodie conversation even though he was clearly very busy if hes around i recommend sitting in front of himthe food was great its definitely up there in the top 2 sushi places i have ever been to and the other place is no longer in business particularly memorable was the maguro nigiri which really tasted fresh and very tunalike in a good way the ebi nigiri also tasted different from every other place i have been too i guess because it was so fresh the texture was the difference each of the rolls were massive the only item that didnt do it for me was a roll that had deep fried batter which seemed a little heavy for me everyone around me was having the poke monster so i tried it during happy hour two nights later incredible and really satisfying my two hosts were marcy and ryan and they are to be commended for their cheerfulness and serviceim going make this a regular stop when im downtown see you next week,1.0

pretty sad that i had the stereotypical car dealership experience here  the one that everyone warns you about  went in on a monday and test drove a carwas really into itthe salesman lonwas very nice friendly and helpfulthe manager im not sure what his name was was pushy  we really were just looking at this point and he  actually said what can we do to get you in this car today  rightwhat he told me he was willing to do at that point was give it to me for less than sticker price and 19 financing  i wanted to do a little more research before committing so i left  went and checked out some cars at different places and ended up coming back to look at the same car the following wednesday  same salesman same manager only this time the manager tells me 5k more than he quoted before and 49 financingwhen i seemed astonished by the finance rate he acted like i was crazy  told me he could go to 39 but no lowerwhich was total bs  at this point i realized he had flat out lied to mei wanted nothing to do with his business especially since i found the same car same year less bells and whistles less mileageless money at another dealership  it took forever for him to accept my no but i finally got out of there and never looked back  he actually told me i had to work with him on the pricethough im the one who has to be able to afford it  i went directly to the other dealership and bought my car and it was a fairly painless experience  on top of all thisfor the following week i had numerous other managers from camelback calling me day and night people i never even spoke to  i guess this way of doing business works for them since they have people buying cars from thembut i just felt like the whole experience was sleazy,0.0

i tried with these guys  i tried  i was extremely patient and extremely nice and easy going  they came and repaired one of our ac units which needed a new compressor motor through our home warranty  although they did not show up on time and did not show up to several recall appointments they did initially schedule to come out quickly within 24 hours and did the initial repair then so luckily we were only without ac for 1 day however the tech did a lazy job and left all our wires exposed to weather and moisture  after contacting the company they scheduled a different tech to come and correct the problem it took me several messages and two weeks later to finally get this tech to come and fix the problem only to find when i returned that he left the ground wire still out and exposed to weather and moisture  i contacted the company right after that which is now a month ago and am still waiting for them to respond and fix this problem  i have two air conditioning units and the unit not touched by air pro has absolutely no exposed wires  ground wires and any electrical wires should not be exposed to weather and moisture outside of any protective casing this is lazy and sloppy work  i have attached three pictures  the first pic is of the first terrible job the second pic is of the second horrible job and the third pic is of my other air conditioning unit and how it is suppose to look  i hope that i can update and let you all know that air pro did the right thing and fixed this problem but considering theyve yet to get back to me well just have to see,0.0

we had a very disappointing lunch and certainly montreal can do better at the height of the tourist season between the fabulous pompeii and lautrec exhibitions the cafe should do much more to appeal to and entice visitors to our city let alone regulars like me the cafe isnt what it used to be be no more  onion soup and there were only a few regional or seasonal specialties the prices were exorbitant considering the offeringsi ordered the soup de jour a flavourless pure of potato and vegetables my main dish an entree of gravlax was mediocre to say the least 3 slices of toasted ficelle with the proverbial smear of flavoured mayo not enough ficelle to match the salmon i ate the rest with the accompanying dinner roll at 13 this was not worth the cost to add insult to injury my accompanying baby arugula greens were topped with a disgusting piece of mystery object dried arugula something that should not escape a cautious chefs eyelunch for 3 without wine tip or coffee we all ordered the appetizer plates and there was one other soup was 83 the only positive note was the service of our waitress she was very attentive and professional i did however note that there was a couple who stood for about 10 minutes before being greeted or seated by the hostess they werent happy eitheri think that the cafe has many problems which should be sorted out quickly before its too late,0.0

i ordered cupcakes for valentines day and three months later im still dreaming about them the two flavors that i got were red velvet and rocky road what sets the red velvet apart from other red velvet desserts is that there are chocolate chips baked into the cupcake the icing isnt too sweet and the texture is just perfect  my absolute favorite was the rocky road marshmellow almonds and chocolate it was delicious im usually not a fan of eating icing on cupcakes but i devoured the whole thing because it was that good i cant wait to try other flavors like the irish car bomb for any occasion i recommend koles kakes you cant go wrong and the price is super reasonable,1.0

not to be negative but this was a really weird experience im a visitor from ny and i asked for an appt and i got one pretty quickly considering i was only in town for about 10 days i was put on a waitlist then put in from a cancellation the person i spoke to touched base with me very quickly so id give them 5 stars in that dept they were very prompt i sent her an email of my hair and the style i was hoping for i sent her pictures of my hair wet and one picture of it when it was blowdried straight wo my permission and 1 or 2 of the style i wanted a simple pineapple bun with bangsshe told me she doesnt do updos which was no problem but then she said that she couldnt help me because people come to her for cuts curly styles and education and are not ironing their hair i kept trying to tell her that i dont iron or even blowdry my hair ever it was just to show the length of my hair but she basically brushed me off i told her that i was struggling on styling my hair and i just wanted some help and insight on how to handle it and it was like the second they saw my hair mildly straightened they couldnt be bothered to help me on the one hand i appreciate the idea of being honest so as not to waste anyones time but on the other i feel like there was bias and a huge wall put up the second they saw my hair i dont think i was really given a fair chance at all i didnt understand why one picture of my hair that was blowdried months ago without my permission when ive been natural for almost 3 years was enough to condemn me i asked for an explanation as to where their concerns were and was never contacted again disappointing and strange experience honestly it made me feel really bad because ive just been trying to figure it out for so long and a place that seemed like it could provide real insight just couldnt be bothered to do so i was really excited because other reviews are amazing this was truly a let downdisclaimer i didnt get a real chance to even use their services or visit their location  this is just a reaction to how i was treated as a potential client your experience may be different ill include pictures,0.0

i bought the groupon deal 20 classes for 25 i went to about 10 classes before giving up getting there located on dupont there is enough free parking on the street facilities the gym is up the stairs in a shady warehouse at the start of class people skip rope in the hall way on cold concrete because the gym itself is a poorly ventilated sweatsmelling thincarpeted old and cramped room with one boxing ring and some hanging punching bags i cant get over that i actually went to the disgusting gym as many as 10 times some days the stench was so bad that i gagged a bit not to mention that the dumb bells are always wet with other peoples sweat and never use the community boxing gloves it was the most disgusting thing i ever did the class itself while the groupon advertised boxing classes it was more of a boot camp class tony the instructor lazily pulls out a card from a deck and states the number of drills we would do you can take advantage of the class and push yourself as hard as you want to but the gym members arent particularly motivated some days in the last half hour he would have us punch bags but wouldnt direct us how to do it properly so i never learned anything,0.0

ive been living in broadstone arts district for nearly a year and i have to say that this is the absolute best apartment complex in all of phoenix before choosing broadstone i visited at least 20 different properties in the same category but nothing and i mean absolutely nothing came close the first thing is the locationmcdowell and central is an ideal spot that gives you access to everythingbang opposite the phoenix theater and the light rail the second thing is the quality of the construction they used really high quality materials all around and it shows the walls and floors are thicki havent heard a neighbor since ive been here and all the fixtures around the apartment are top quality the amenities are firstclass the pool is gorgeous the gym is fantastic the digital concierge makes getting packages a snap and i like that the building is super secure requires a fob to get around ive had only positive interactions with the management alyssa really went out of her way to help me get the paperwork done fast and to get settled and jasmine has been fabulousany time i have a request or feedback she listens carefully and takes immediate action the entire team has been extremely helpful with every request and the place is really really well maintainedpristinethe pool the grounds and the buildingthe management takes the time to organize regular events for the residents and goes the extra distance to have a variety of interesting activities they regularly sponsor an in house artist and host artrelated events as well in keeping with the theme of the building and its locationim writing this review because i know how hard it is to find the right place to live and i just wanted to share this with anyone considering broadstone its a decision you will thank yourself for making,1.0

this place is downright awful went here on a saturday morning for brunch only two other small groups were in the restaurant when we went yet the service was still terrible the waitress had an injured leg yet management still thought it was smart to seat a group upstairs due to her struggling around the restaurant it caused our service to be slow we all 3 of us ordered bloody marys when they didnt come for twenty minutes i went to check and they had been sitting on the bar the while time when we finally got them anther ten minutes had gone by they were watered down and tasteless this was potentially the worst bloody mary i have ever had in my life the food was not good either it wasnt terrible but it was extremely subpar all ordered omelets supposedly comes with toast and jelly no jelly was given until we asked came with home fries which were nothing more than a cut up potato warmed up overall i would never eat or drink here again unfortunate too because it could be a cool local spot,0.0
this place is my weakness its a good and  bad thing that its nearby good because as a local i dont have to drive far for beyond amazing bar food or a cool atmosphere bad well not really because there are so many great and truly unique menu items to choose from youll eventually wind up ordering them allwarning leave your diet at the door musthaves at bar include the texas nachos buffalo mac n cheese tequila lime chicken and the chicken katsu sliders all are more than generous portions and are seasoned to perfection i say this because most bar food is an afterthought and pretty bland at bar everything has its own flavor often unexpected for example for dessert i asked if they had brownieswhich are my favoritethe sever didnt hesitate to recommend the brownie topped with cookie crisp cereal and whipped cream who does that they did and do and its why bar is one of my favorite dining outlets in the silverado ranch area also love the fact that its 24hrs and it doesnt try too hard to be hip or coolit just is,1.0

absolutely perfect from start to finish  the installatation of a fairly large project went flawlessly during the scorching summer heat  karens absolutely essential and outofbox but not killer expensive design ideas can make a huge difference  i have posted before and after pictures under robert s the yard actually looks better now picture was taken before i figured out how to stop rabbits from eating the ground coverfirst world problems because rolling rock came in with some additional and replacement plants and additional decorative rocks they have this great source so you can avoid generic boulders and gravel  jim is a star with a heart of gold and is right in there with the guys  once it gets going it is like a choreographed dance  like any small company excellent in their area they get very busy and cant please all the people all the timebut t they tryonce they are working with you you are part of their family  they come right out if there are any issues and have more than stood by their warranties without us having to ask for them to stand by their warrantythey just do itwe wouldnt have used anybody else,1.0
one of the best sandwiches ive ever had i love that there still exists a place on the strip to get cheap quality food all of their sandwiches and salads are 599 and packed with quality and flavor best of all theyre open 24 hours luckily for me i stayed in the westgate towers at planet hollywood so we were only a stones throw away from earls among my group of friends i bet we hit this place up at least 5 times a day my favorite is the club sandwich the bread ingredients and special sandwich sauce they put in all meld together perfectly their chicken caesar salad is also delicious croutons were on the salty side but no matter yes the line can get long but it goes by really fast clubs gambling and other shenanigans are fun but earls is definitely gonna be my reason for returning to vegas,1.0

i am a newbie big time to this whole industry i decided to sign up for med marijuana card for the pain i have caused by pd i walked in feeling very inexperienced ridiculously inept and self conscious front desk was genuinely welcoming and helpful  ready to make me feel at ease  i was then lead into the product area by rodrigo r who right away was very friendly not the forced friendly i got the feeling that was his nature he asked me the why behind getting the medical marijuana card he knew  understood about my pd and the pain he knew which strains would be best for my type of pain and he was knowledgeable about the amount and seeing how green pun intended i was about it all rodrigo was very patient with me since i needed pretty much a picture drawn out for my naive ass i will always be very grateful to the holistic center for making my first experience a very pleasant one,1.0

i can proudly say that when i was in college over my time there i ate every single sandwich on the menu back when my body could take the abuse best sandwichs on the menu fat f fat milf best fat sorastitute fat cowboy and a few others i cant recall worst are fat caesar and fat falafel bleh those were nasty this is a college staple and where you have to go if you have never been their before grab a six pack and drink while you wait eat it while its fresh it will turn nasty in your fridge place is packed when bars close but empty just about any other time its super unhealthy but will sober you up in a minute good and bad at night they will take your name then call it when your sandwich is ready but they will ask you what you ordered its really hard to remember after a night of drinking so concentrate they do it because people try to steal sandwiches,1.0

ok ill start by saying to be fair the two staff members i interacted with were perfectly nice and helpful and the main dining area was clean but god damn the food is soooooo gross and its very expensive considering how gross it is over 3 for a crappy cheeseburger thats more sauce than burger and over 4 for the most disgusting chili cheese fries ive ever had i love chili cheese fries i get them everywhere the fact that i 1 couldnt finish them 2 didnt want them to go and 3 didnt even consider taking them with me to try to give to someone else and instead just threw them away cuz they were so gross is really really really saying somethingand the bathroom which i used after i was done with the super gross excuse for food was also pretty dirty the place was totally empty and there were no cars in the drive through its a wonder anyone would come here for a repeat visit as there is much better and cheaper stuff in the same area and the two staff who were there were nowhere to be seen its not fair for me to say they were doing nothing just because i couldnt see them there is a now hiring sign up and they could be catching up on shit or something back there but its definitely not a good look on your business to have only one customer around and your customer toilet seat looks like it hasnt been cleaned in a week especially when your food is also super disgustingi feel so ripped off almost even scammed and i wish i could get my money back this place seems like they are trying to be innout which i guarantee you is far superior to this place regardless of how you feel about them to charge the prices tommys does for such garbage is criminal what a huge waste of money,0.0

copy of what i wrote on their facebook wall as it will probably be deleted by themfirst trip ever to vegas saturday started the afetrnoon by getting a quick bite at the bistro buffet then 2 hours into my stay i get trapped at a slot machine for 1 hour bc your system crashed i couldnt get up to tell my husband where i was bc then some one could take my seat and my money as the machines were not printing vouchers after complaining to management i was told we had a 75 food and beverage credit yea right wake up at 3 am sweating shaking heart beating freaking out call front desk to see if there is a hotel doctor no spend the next 5 hours vomiting from a nice case of food poisoning when i finally could attempt to drift off room next door was having a party its 4 am security is called they finally stfu next day double check there is still food credit low and behold no such credit exists on our room we are lucky enough to find the same manager who issued it i notify him of my episode of poisoning and ask if the credit is good for food in the gift shop as i refuse to eat at any more resturants in the palms for the remainder of my stay yes he says of course we stock up on drinks and food for ur 5 hour drive home having a feeling there would be yet another problem we keep the receit and open nothing i ask if the room next to us has checked out and if they have not wed like another room the did but the noisy bunch of girls was replaced by a nosier bunch of men blasting katy perry at  am again security is called im so ready to go home and never come back to vegas again at this point  its monday morning  7 amwe are cheking out early to get home for a dr appointment and of course as expected almost the credit does not cover gift shop food the gift shop refuses to take the returned unopened items yes heres the part where i throw my luggage on the floor and go ballistic after 30 mins of threatening to call my lawyer finally they declare my balance at zero i kept the reciept as im sure they will start charging us randomly since they are clearly so unorganized and shady retrain your employees palms thanks for ruining my trip next time we will fork over the extra money and stay at caesers i cant believe two people in 2 days could have so many issues with 1 terrible resortps i made a yelp account just to warn others of your horrible motel you should feel honoredpps  ps theres no shower doors so its freezing theres no complimentary items in the bathroom except shampoo and lotion so i had to blow dry my hair each morning which is a pain in the ass as i have enough hair for three people we were lucky to find a pen and i could hear construction above us ive had better times at a days inn oh and way to try to sneak in some mini bar charges upon my check out im not stupid enough to even glance at a mini bar palms is unapologetic and their customer service is a joke,0.0

at last mr lees woonam jung adds ayce korean bbq to their menu ordering their tender delicious kalbi a la carte certainly put a hole in my pocket as tasty as it was i had a difficult time paying 30 for a plate of it on top of whatever entree i ate sura has some serious competition now that mr lee threw his hat into the ayce kbbq ring for a measly 26 at dinner you can fill your three stomachs with all the kalbi you want and your other three with bulgogi chadolbaegi thinly sliced beef brisket samgyupsal pork belly dak chicken bulgogi  deh ji pork bulgogi plus the steamed egg and doenjang jjigae soybean soup traditionally served with a korean bbq meal given you have six full stomachs and still have room to spare all of this and more is bottomless and you still get a 5star worthy selection of fresh banchan think of those pricey frontloading washerdryers yeah those shiny fancy ones that are so quiet you can take a nap in the laundry room theyre considerably less annoying than their toploading ancestors where am i going with this woonam jung uses the fancy frontloaders of bbq hoodsnearly silent and 1000x more efficient you wont have to project your voice over a noisy fan and youll go home smelling like your perfume of the night instead of grilled meat while woonam jung doesnt look like much from the outside the inside is nicely decorated and has this asian tranquility thing going for it in short its a more luxurious establishment to stuff your face if you want to up your dining experience or fancy up the act of overeating woonam jungs food presentation modern plates and cute server uniforms will not disappointayce bbq is available at lunchtime but i hope you like bulgogi because kalbi isnt served until dinner and if for whatever reason youre not into the ayce bbq thing or great deals make you feel cheap bbq is still available to purchase a la carte and their other entrees are flat out delicious the yukgaejang and dolsot bibimbap are two of my favorites,1.0

as someone who literally went to lux 56 timesweek its no surprise that i sing such a song of praise for its next door neighbor pane bianco chris bianco is a breadmaking fiend everything about this place i love sure seating is only limited to the picnic tables outside but the whole point it to grab a quick sammy and goooo the lines are long during lunch hour but they are efficient and quick ingredients are fresh and most are locally sourced my favorite sandwiches are their housemade mozzarellabasiltomato sammy which they offer daily and their occasional roasted lamb market sandwich with arugula no matter what you get the flavors are fantastic and the bread is so rustic and delicious most of the time i ended up eating half and sharing with someone else because they are filling when my appetite isnt too big i go for their foccaccia of the day which changes daily but is no less amazing particular favorites utilized ingredients such as roasted shallots dried figs poached plums goat cheese and so onits hearty enough to be meal on its own and its under 4they also offer a couple of market salads which i never really tried and theyve got a selection of artisinalgourmet cheeses and pantry goods imported from italy if theyve still got some vanilla bean pudding go for itnotes parking is tight as they share with lux theyve got parking on both sides bigger lot is off of turney and ample street parking on turney as well they close as 3pm so get there early and they are only open tuessat you can call orders in ahead of time and if you want to eat your lunch inside of lux they allow it,1.0

both my girlfriend and i have concluded that wild mango is poorly executed expensive italianasian fusion  maybe our expectations were too highthe decor reminded me of melting pot  i did enjoy the privacy and the ambiance  however the chairs were uncomfortably hard and too large for my 51 girlfriend  she could not sit with her back to the chair without lifting her feet up off the ground  and the menus are printed on really bulky and obtrusive wooden surfboardsthe food they gave us two pieces of bread  the croissantlike bun was stale and hard the other was burnt but tasted sort of like asian bao bread so it was okay the calamari was sliced way too thin and i could only taste the breading  it was seasoned with their version of chinese five spice which had a flavor profile that is best described as offputting the chicken trio the chicken cheesecake looked and tasted like a cheeseburger it was okay the middle chicken slices were overcooked and dry  the chicken drumstick was good but the mashed potatoes that it was embedded in were not the duck was also seasoned with the five spice but i managed to bear some of it because they also added a bit of sugar  it came with sweet potato mash that wasnt sweet and tasted kind of disgustingour waitress seemed hesitant and sort of uncomfortable talking to us  maybe she wasnt used to having actual asian people eat herewe didnt finish our meal went home and had microwave tv dinners,0.0

first time i called for a quote to get a quote for two residential retaining walls sidewalk and a patio left a message that was never returned second time was told by the receptionist sorry we cant help you with that and after saying that she hung up on me considering this companys website describes residential concrete work and that it was recommended to us by a friend who had residential concrete work done was surprised by this response would have been great to hear what the does do and perhaps a recommendation for another company more in line with our needs,1.0
my favorite mexican food in north charlotte we always sit at the bar where the bartender nacho yes thats really his name takes great care of us my fianc and i always get the cheese dip and arroz con pollo with cheese sauce instead of tomato sauce  the service is always on point and the portions are huge  the restaurant stays pretty busy even though its off the main road but there is plenty of seating  clean restaurant and always an enjoyable experience,1.0
it bums me out to say this but we did not have a good experience here we were seated directly next to the kitchen which was uncomfortably hot so much so that the table next to us asked to be moved because it was so bad i wish we had moved as well because that one tiny bathroomsized vent was definitely not large enough to cool that size room when we left we discovered that with the misters on it was actually cooler outside on one of the warmest days of the summer so far service was fine but food was pretty lackluster we started with the tuna poke which was good but not great my fianc and i both had the beef tenderloin with mashed potatoes and garlic spinach flavor was ok but the steaks were rare to blue when we both ordered medium rare we let our server know no manager stopped by but didnt even bother asking for it to be refired to the temperature of our liking because it was so hot in there that we were mostly set on getting out as soon as possible against our original plans we were wooed by the desert choices so we hung around for that thinking that might save our experience only to be let down by that as well i ordered the tres leches cake with plum sauce on the side the cake was boring the whip cream had a strange menthol flavor i think they were going for mint but it tasted very artificial and thank goodness i had the plum sauce on the side because that was so bizarre  extremely medicinal tasting and completely inedible my fianc had the flourless turtle brownie which was dry as all heck and literally had one pecan in the entire thing it tasted like i tried to make a microwave mug brownie but cooked the crap out of it 120 out the door for a very mediocre dinner we will not be returning,0.0

i love this gym they always have great music its never over crowded and everyone who works here is professional and courteous the hassle of getting here when there is a home game street closures is well worth it the personal trainers are unique and have different styles and mark training manager seems to do a great job pairing customer with the right trainer if all that wasnt enough the clientele who come to this gym are here to work out no perfume texting while hogging a machine or creepy guys who follow you around the gym as you do dead lifts ladies you know what im talking about great gym,1.0
i love presidential ive used them now 4 times all of the drivers have been great they have always been on time i have modified reservations with no issues the cars were all new and clean smelled great the sound systems were kinda weak especially in the 1214 person escalade it sounded as if they had no rear speakers ive done point to point transfers the airport transfer and the tour the tour was fun but the wasnt really a tour as much as it was a chauffeur to a few places luckily i know the city well enough it was not an issue the champagne is usually warm and its nothing fancy but it tasted alright with ice we had no problem killing the bottles in a few minutes so it couldnt have been that bad but like i said its cheap champagne its a nice touch but shouldnt play any factor in picking presidential over a competitori have seen some people on yelp that have had some customer service issues and ive seen presidentials response and it does seem to come off a bit abrasive hopefully i am never on the receiving end and a lot of it seems to be people not reading the detailsetc but i do think it could publicly be handled in a more elegant fashion from the companies sidefor me i wont use any other company in las vegas for limo service for my future visits to this wonderful city it sure beats a rank smelling cabby or fighting to avoid the fast route aka the tunnel,1.0

take notethis is probably the most honest and longest review of new results medical weight loss that you will readfirst spoiler alert new results does not have any magic nr3 pill or magic plan to make you lose weight they dont have a patented latest weight loss trick and they dont have their own brand of protein bars and shakes their medicine and supplements have been used for dieting for 40 years you dont see a doctor every visit but not sure youd want to pay for that anyway the first visit with brett and the weight loss team comes across as a well practiced monologue and includes a 20 minute instructional video they talk about everything youd expectthe really hard first days where you lose a bunch of water weight fast then the longer phase 2 with slower but still real loss and then the transition period kind of like every major diet book out there see nothing new brett is totally a friendly maybe salesmany personality and gives you a great go get em speech to pump you up gives you your appetite suppressants supplements and meal plan and sends you on your way the only thing missing was the this is a pound of musclethis is a pound of fat demonstration you could almost buy a 10 book for the same infoand im still giving it 5 stars why because brett really does seem to care hes passionate about this topic and it bleeds over into his staff who are fantastic they are honestly the most encouraging group of weight support people i have ever met and ive met a few and cost how about way less than all the ones you hear on the radio call around and checkyoull see what i meanheres the deal i know how i lose weightive successfully done it in the past on my own without any expensive doctor visits ive counted calories counted points analyzed different foods gone caveman low fat high fat tracked food and weight religiously and seen the pounds slip off over time ive done enough fad diets that i feel i have a pretty good understanding of calorie deficits how my body burns etc nevertheless i found myself now 6070lbs overweight and the heaviest ive been in my entire life i was borderline depressed about it and just couldnt motivate myself to get back into the pound per week habit over 812 months i would get 2 days back into it and give up because it just seemed sooo looog till id hit my goal i honestly felt like i had one more try in me and wanted to get it rightthis is why you go to new results if its your first time trying to lose weight then they will provide tons of good education eyeopening education but lets face itmost of us who are trying to lose are familiar with the drill what i lack what we lack is motivation to get over the hump when you go to new results you are not buying a magic pill or special home delivery meal plan you are buying a weight loss education and ideology that includes great coaching accountability and a few little tools that help smooth out the experience this is where brett and his staff shine you walk in and his staff actually greets you with a smileits like they are genuinely happy to see you bretts the first to tell you that their low sugar low carb nutrition plan is nothing new but he does explain why its a really great option for fast true healthy weight loss and helps you understand how to do it you get tools to make it more comfortable you get coaching and encouragement you get motivation to not eat that free cake and ice cream at work today because you have a weigh in coming upno you dont see a doctor much but you are initially seen by a real medical doctor who is accountable for making sure its safe for you to use the medicine checking your heart condition writing you the prescription and determining how you respond to it i have to assume that unless he wants sued hes monitoring things behind the scenes and not just writing blank checkser prescriptionsis the price a steal no but its not robbery either like i saidcall around i found it way cheaper than every other place out there with the almost identical plan and you are getting a doctor monitored weight loss planbottom line the speals at first seem a little rehearsed and the whole first visit seems pretty choreographed the medicine and techniques are nothing new butthe medicine and techniques work the staff is crazy friendly encouraging supportive and helpful and it sets them apart if you follow their plan you will lose weight faster than anything other than bariatric surgery but furthermore you will understand why you are losing weight and what lifestyle changes are needed to keep that skinny body they put it in your hands but they also give you all the tools you need to succeed now its up to youis it time then go visit new results,1.0

while on a trip to toronto we decided to stop in here and take a break my wife ordered the iced coffee and i just had an americano it came to 843 mostly due to the ice coffee as they charge over 5 bucks for that with tax after my wife decided to take a bathroom break the server came over and bussed our table i was done but before i had the chance to react she was pouring my wifes drink down the sink i could not understand what just happened my wife came back and said where is my drink i looked over at the server who was singing a song that was playing out loud like nothing just happened and said she took it this was the strangest feeling i would suggest if you order here you clearly tell the staff to not bus your table under after you leave,0.0

this was super overdue but we finally got a chance to go back to angry crab shack unlike our previous experience this one was absolutely amazing the estimated wait time given to us was about 40 minutes so i grabbed a margarita from the bar but it ended up only being about 20 or 25 minutes our waitress came by soon after to grab our order i got a pound of shrimp head off with 4 pieces of sausage in medium trifecta sauce and a piece of cornbread my boyfriend got a pound of the vegetables with 4 pieces of sausage in hot trifecta sauce and gumbo it didnt take too long for our order to come out everything was piping hot and looked absolutely deliciousmy shrimp was so so good id say that medium was just the right amount of spice for me  spicy but not too spicy with a lot of garlicky delicious flavor the sausage was kind of an afterthought and next time id probably skip it just because the shrimp was so much food surprisingly the vegetables were really good too the bag had an array of different kinds including broccoli bell peppers even some pineapple as well as ones that we actually didnt know what they were i love cornbread as it is and thought the one here was phenomenal it was more cakey than what ive had at other restaurants which was fine it was super moist and had a bit of sweetness my boyfriend who typically dislikes cornbread thought it was good too lastly the gumbo was super tasty it was thick and chunky with lots of little shrimp pieces of sausage etc etcthe prices here for a pound of seafood are pretty fair the next time i return though id most likely be inclined to order just a big bowl of gumbo and cornbreadour waitress was really attentive during our visit she made suggestions for food came by to check on us grabbed us refills and our check in a timely manner like i said previously this experience so great well definitely be back,1.0
this place is amazing probably the best sushi ive had in toronto and im the biggest sushi snob ever its not to be confused with food court quality sushi which you would automatically assume it is since it is underground in the financial district i would recommend ordering some of their specialty rolls diablo for the raw salmon lover black mamba and teriyaki bomb they make it for you on the spot ingredients are always fresh and the rice is on point i think the quality of the rice and how its cooked is so underrated in sushi its a bit pricey but worth every penny to treat yourself my coworkers are also obsessed with this place and we make a sushi run about once every 2 weeks,1.0

im not a huge fan of restaurants on the strip food is similar even across cuisines and its very over priced  picasso is an exception service is perfect polite helpful not too intrusive the space very nice  its not too dark well spaced and the art is beautiful  its not too loud and because it is well spaced you dont need to worry about others being part of your conversationi had the four course pre fixe first they were totally on board with my celiac disease restrictions  they said they would make anything aside from a couple of desserts gluten free  so no restrictions on what i could or could not get on the menu the amusebouche was refreshing and i usually dont like cold soups the pork belly and pea soup was smooth tangy and the pork belly added a nice pop the ruby shrimp was ok  i probably should have chosen the foie gras the veal chop was tender juicy and savory and the horseradish was very nice every third bite or so the flourless chocolate lava cake was delightful  rich and not too heavyalthough im not a huge fan of walking through the bellagio ill do it to come back to picasso,0.0

i had low expectations because the reviews werent amazing but i was really pleasantly surprised first of all i have to comment on the serviceamazing probably the best service ive had at a restaurant in a long time our waitress was extremely attentive but not invasive and never left us without a full drink in some tiny glasses we sat at the pizza bar and some of the chefs behind the bar checked on us as well and were interested as to whether we liked our food every person i encountered on the staff was extremely friendly and helpful now the food we started with the wedding soup which was very tasty and had lots of stuff in it which is great next was the mambo pizza and one more whose name i forget that had ricotta peruvian peppers and sausage both were delicious the crust was crispy on the outside and slightly charred and the inside was soft and doughy the toppings were plentiful and extremely fresh half a pie was enough for both of us finished a great meal with a piece of tiramisu which was delicious and was inhaled so quickly i cant comment on it much more i thought the m on top in powdered sugar was a cute touch the atmosphere inside was loud but in an energetic way just be wary if you prefer quiet dining because there was definitely not a quiet spot in the place i liked sitting at the pizza bar because we could watch the chefs work for two sodas soup two pizzas and dessert the bill came to 59,1.0
i was a five guys loyalist for a long time and kept hearing about uniburger as having a better burgeri finally got to go today and it did not disappoint the service was slow but the wait was worth itthe uniburger is perfection without bacon next time ill add baconi reminded me of shake shack in the us or the good burger in spain its perfect on every front the meat the bread the ingredients the sauce i dont know where to start it is without a doubt the best burger in montreal hands down,1.0
at least once a year i get a craving for taco bell i know gross right and so bad for you too i ordered the crunch wrap supreme once and it was so soggy and didnt taste like anything very bland the last time i remember going there i got hard tacos and again absolutely no flavour  had to use hot sauce packets and even then it just tasted like their hot sauce serves me right for going there i guess lol,0.0

ive found my new favorite steakhouse in vegas  i made reservations way in advance for a friends bachelorette party  we came on a saturday night at 730pm and were seated pretty quickly  our servers were awesome  everyone was super nice  i had bought a round of shots for the table and our server came back with a 2nd round on him  all of us ordered some form of steak and we thoroughly enjoyed every last bite  i topped my fillet with foie gras and it was heaven  im still very upset that ca banned it  we ordered sides to share creamed spinahc parmesan truffle fries mac  cheese mushroom pot pie and the special trio of mac  cheese  oh and i cant forget about their bread  it was topped with melted blue cheese and we ate it all  either were a bunch of pigs or all the food was delicious because there was nothing leftanother reason we loved the restaurant was the music  the dj was spinning hip hop and he had us dancing in our seats  even the table next to us was having a great time and danced as they got up to walk around  it does get pretty loud in the restaurant so dont go there expecting to have a quiet romantic dinner the only one bad thing i could even think of for stk was the single stall for the bathrooms  not very convenient  but everything else was superb,1.0
the service super slow the food took forever and the food itself was pretty mediocrei honestly used to like this restaurant a lot specially their brunch and i like how many options they have in the menu for vegan and vegetarians and gluten free etc however my hubby and i did enjoy our visit to insomnia this time super slow service a vegetable wrap half caesar salad and a huecos rancheros took longer than 35 mins and i dont mind waiting when the food its good buuut i wasnt what happened insomnia we are disappointed and we want to love you again,0.0

only reason we decided to eat brunch here instead of the tupelo honey cafe across the street is because of the 2 hour wait at tupelo my advice wait the two hours or simply skip brunch either option would be better than the liberty first of all the service was awful i would have liked to order a coffee or an order of the biscuits for the table but our server never gave us the opportunity when our food finally arrived it was another disappointment half of the food was cold and my breakfast sandwich was so saturated in grease it was inedible 1010 would not recommend and will never be returning,0.0
oreganos is an amazing place for being a chain pizza is good i get the thin crust the picasso salad is beyond amazing and big enough for two people prices are reasonable and you get a large amount of food only issue is they can get busy i order takeout and you have to call early as they have takeout windows that can be an hour or after you order,1.0
i recently attended the ces conference and was excited to find myself in the same hotel as chica i am admittedly a fan of chef lorena garcia so this restaurant was already on my bucket list to try since the opening last yearso of course my first order of business before any conferencerelated activities was a solo brunch they seated me quickly even though it was pretty busy already i was quickly offered the chance to order a drink by the awesome adrienne and went with a nice classic mimosa the menu is very simple just two pages but i asked for some suggestions from the staff before ordering adrienne brought me the guacamole appetizer with an assortment of accoutrements  tortilla chips plantain chips and mini arepas in different flavors the guacamole was delicious and i really loved the pairing with the plantain chips the arepas were excellent and i enjoyed their flavors so much i didnt bother dipping them in the guacamolei also ordered the grilled peruvian octopus which did not disappoint at all it was perfectly cooked amazing flavor from both the octopus and the shishito peppers and the crispy quinoa offered a nice light crunch absolutely recommend this appetizerfor the main course i settled on the chica burger which adrienne and manager michael recommended to me when i couldnt decide i had my heart set on tacos but im glad i went with their suggestion this burger is outstanding perfectly cooked to my preferred pink in the middle with a super flavorful meat blend and the kick of the chica sauce was nice as well its topped with bacon jalapeno jack cheese avocado crispy fried onions lettuce and tomato definitely a twohander and definitely recommendi didnt stop there i wanted one more drink and the bartender freddy served up a margarita called some like it hot its made with their housemade papaya habanero jam lime juice and espolon reposado tequila it has quite the quick and im told that the spice level can vary based on the batch of jam but if you like spicy youll love thislastly i dabbled in some dessert the pastry chef at chica recently won pastry chef of the year in las vegas httpwwweatinglvcom201712pastrychefyearsarasteelechica so of course i had to try some dessert her tres leches dulce de leche cake is absolutely incredible i would come back over and over just for that i can not sing the praises of this place any more than this if youre visiting vegas and you want to eat somewhere where the food is delicious the staff is wonderful and the atmosphere is great head over to chica,1.0
the only reason im rating 1 star is because 0negative stars is not an option  this place is a clip joint  went here april 15 for an oil change  almost as soon as i got out of my car louis started bothering me about using synthetic oil which is a 34 upgrade  when i told him i dont use synthetic oil in my 2005 pruis he looked at me in horror  he then led me to the office where he looked up the specs on my car  he pointed out on the monitor where it called for 5w30 grade oil api energy conserving  pretty much every oil produced is api energy conserving  he flat out lied to me and said that api energy conserving meant full synthetic oil  i told him it doesnt and he shut up after that  this place is crooked and running scams  i would never come here again  i wouldnt be surprised if they used cheaper oil than the semisynthetic i paid for since i saw him pour oil out of a large plastic jug  avoid these conartists,0.0

weve been going to this restaurant for about 2 years now as a little background story it is family owned and operated the family immigrated to the us but first spent some time in vietnam thus the vietnamese dished on the menu in addition to the chinese the place is indeed a bit antiquated in decor but it really makes up for it in foodflavor the best way to enjoy this place is to go there with a few people and eat the food familystyle sometimes you get to sit in the big booth table with the lazysusan the last time i was there i sat with a group of 7 people and each person ordered a different dish my favorites are the housechicken which is a lightly battered and fried and then they pour a light sweetsoy type sauce over it the hot and sour soup is also very tasty you can order it extra spicy if you want it has all kinds of veggies and shrimp pork and tofu as well another good choice is the fried rice they make pork or house fried rice are quite delicious oh and i almost forgot the walnut shrimp omg delicious my pregnant sister cant have enough of thatthe servers sometimes make fruit drinks that they hand out with crushed ice im not sure if we get those because they know us or just because we usually have water to drink so i cant comment on sodapricing the waiterswaitresses have accents because they were not born in the us some people should just get over that ive been telling other friends about this place and ill expect to go there again in the next few weeks,1.0

so went today and took my soon to be 5 year old went from 11am to 4pm first off you have to understand this review is when some schools are still in session and a tuesday after a holiday so crowds were small because of this we had a great time this is a great place for kids of all ages and adults now i understand why some people get upset and write reviews they do but more often than not its not the parks fault and if they just plan ahead theyll be fine heres some advice first off invest in some non slip water shoes itll make your feet feel great walking all over the hot pavement you can also just wear flip flops and leave them where ever you go but its kinda of a hassle i even saw people take them with them on rides but that seemed silly i doubt anyone is going to steal your 5 year old wrong size ugly thongs like mine are second people complain its expensive it was 5 for a snow cone 12 for a double cheesburger basket meal and so on not quite disneyland prices and not quite raising canes either lets solve this take a cooler pack a lunch they will let you reenter turn on your car ac and relax in the car and have lunch i did we thought it was a nice break entrance fee too much people said costco 27 tickets go between now and may 31 and upgrade to a season pass  the park get a gold one for just 35 bucks more includes free parking saves you 8 a trip 99 cent drink refills and a bunch of great stuff you can find on their website people complained about the leadership there yeah the kids are young and if you get out of line im sure there will be adults not real happy that someone half their age is telling them what to do you know how many kids are in  their water tonsthey are watching everyone with very good reason they have rules for a reason not just so you can feel butt hurt about being scolded by an 18 year old  also there are a ton of places to find shade and put your stuff you can leave it at your chair or rent a locker again buy a pass and save these are not requirements you dont have to spend the extra  but its there if you want to i didnt take my 15 month old and wife today but will next time there is even tons to do for them now remember i went on a tuesday in may if you go on a saturday during peak time expect peak crowds we walked on to every slide today but i am not foolish enough to think that is the norm have fun and play safe,1.0

this review is for the bcbg at town square yep its another dud of a store for customer service i found a top and a bag i really liked ready to purchase them but the associates were too busy in their conversation to get me another size i left the fitting room twice to go get my own sizes as they stood there watching me and continuing their conversation regarding the handbag i liked it was all scuffed up so i asked them to grab me another one they said it was the only one ok no problem i dont want to purchase the scuffed one but on my way out there was another one right by the window maybe if they werent so busy talking to each other about their car insurance they would know their merchandise better ughh ill just buy it at saks so they get the sale instead of these underachievers,0.0
this is the second time ive had the pleasure of eating here and a pleasure it is the big bloody mary is a meal in itself and very tasty the first time i was here i had the bangers and mash and my tummy was in heaven great texture and flavor in the sausage yumon this most recent trip i had the mini cheeseburger appetizer as i wasnt super hungry and it was perfect so often sliders are dry and puckish but these were incredible perfectly grilled to a nice juicy medium the generously sized  and delicious patty filled the tender brioche bun and was smothered in cheese and a crisscross of bacon yumthey also do a great job with their cocktails my friend is picky about her greyhound she likes just a splash of grapefruit juice and the bar got it right every timeour server afro was beyond excellent he made good suggestions knowing we werent starving and was a delight i would request his table again for sure love gordon ramsay and love the pub  grill,1.0

disclaimer i would give a 45 if i could falls ice cream is located in a quaint set back little town in downtown olmsted falls there is parking everywhere with signs telling where it is the ice cream shop is set back in the village and it is not visible from columbia however you will recognize and know the village if you look at one picture of falls ice creams storefront you can easily access the shop from 480 and 71 with about a 8 minute drive from the highway to the shop from both we got the nondairy cookies and cream and the nondairy mint chocolate chip they are amazing and the creamiest vegan ice cream i have ever had most vegan ice cream tastes like flavored ice this did not sadly we sampled some of the sorbets and they were freezer burnt i know that they just cannot sell enough of it but if it was fresh it would have been good there are plenty of places to sit tables at falls steps and porches park benches and even a large gazebo a minutes walk away if you bring children who are obsessed with trains there is a nonrunning two car train in the back to look at by the gazebo the only downside to falls is they way you get your ice cream scooped everybody crowds into the place and they serve whoever seems the most determined to get served you have to stomp your foot down and tell them you are ready so you are not waiting to order for hours some kind of system to the ordering maybe deli tickets would be nice also they are definitely understaffed they usually have about 3 people working when they should have at least 4 maybe 5 also they have plenty of toppings and syrups but they are not on display if you would like any on your ice cream 1 free each one after for a small fee just ask and see if they have it because they may i love the atmosphere there but they definitely may need to move to another unit if the serving process becomes more of a problem,0.0

well i wasnt expecting much from this place and i was right to i had the fusiadog basically a cheap hot dog straight out of the maple leaf package with some kimchi just some shredded cabbage and carrots hardly kimchi by any standard on top the whole experience cost over 7 bucks total rip off save your money and go to a hot dog vendor on the street at least you can get a sausage for under 4 bucksi dont see this place lasting long i would of paid at best 3 bucks for the fusiadog i could see this whole idea working if it was just a street cart and meals went for under 5 bucks but to expect people to pay north of 7 dollars for a cheap crappy hot dog is nuts i understand that the area is high rent but this place is going to offer a hell of a lot more if they want to stay afloatin short go to any number of the street vendors in the area if you want a hot dog,0.0

awful experience  1 they are overpriced and give zero discounts for multiple pets even when coming in during the same appointment  they charged me for an office visit for each of my pets even though they were all in one room and got barely any attention individually  the doctor was significantly late ever coming to the room and then had almost no answers to any of my questions  my hour appointment turned into a four hour  all afternoon endeavor  they wanted a follow up for the pets but again wanted to charge a 4050 visit fee for each dog for 1 follow up shot each  to make matters worse they flat lie  i had my grandparents dogs with me to get shots  i told them this  they assured me that they did not report animals to the county for licensing  we had just moved here and i didnt need that headache yet  low and behold a couple months later i get a notice from the county for not having the dogs licensed and now owe a penalty fee  i specifically asked if they report and they assured me they did not so i hadnt been in a big hurry  if you report be honest about it  there is nothing i despise more in a company than dishonesty,0.0

fucking horrible  being from both la and nyc  i think folks standards of food is way too low  like giving 5 stars to in and out burgerthis place is gross  i ordered 3 things in an attempt to not go wrong1 chicken wings2 chicken pad thai3 mooshoo shrimp all badthe chicken wings are battered in bisquik  why  what for  im not saying not to season fried chicken but no asian joint makes wings that come out looking like fried oreos from a carnival   the chicken pad thai  i hate when restaurants dont soak the noodles long enough so they come out undercooked  the sauce used tasted like mcdonlads bbq sauce and they breaded the chicken  so literally its like a rice based fettuccine with bbq sauce and chicken nuggetsinstead of traditional sprouts it came with iceberg lettuce and carrots  just wtfthe moo shoo  comes in beef chicken or shrimp  no pork which is traditionally what it should be was dripping wet with sauce and came with more sauce on the sidewe took two bites of everything and asked for the checki cant stand businesses who will ask you if you want a box to go but not ask you whats wrong if you choose to say no thanks with 80 full dishes   so i really dont give a rats ass if they gave me service with a smile  that smile is on auto pilot  if they really cared theyd ask me how come im wasting all this foodi actually thought the decor was rather nice and being there was other patrons i thought ot myself how bad could this place be   wrong  wrong wrongthere is a reason shitty places like these are not in china town because they wouldnt last a day against real competition   bottom line  if youre in the mood for anything asian get your butt to china town  otherwise youre better off getting pizza or chipotle across the street   holy hell this place was gross,0.0

this place is basically the definition of what you want from a local establishment first the product in this case gelato and pastries is both excellent and unique fried chicken and waffles gelato does that even make any sense who cares its awesome there is a constant rotation of weird and classic flavors you can tell the owners love what they do second the service is always super friendly and engaging were happy to go just to interact we probably stop in every month or so and they always remember my kids theyre just great this place is a real gem if youre looking for a case study on how to run a business just watch this place i cant say enough,1.0

stopped in this store for the first time last week  there was a nice selection of jewelry in silver brass goldfilled etc so at different price pointssomething for every budget  some pieces were made by the owner who is very nice and helpful by the way and others by other local artists i found a pretty delicate pair of earrings designed by a jewelry designer from montreal the store is located in the plateau area and definitely worth a visit lots of other boutiques to poke around too,1.0

what happened to this place i guess coming in at 6pm on a saturday and seeing it completely dead should be a sign for starters the food and drink prices seem ridiculously high from what i remember the staff is alright our waiter was pretty friendly this time around but with as slow as it was it took way too long for our food to come outi went with a new item they had on the menukorean steak tacos for 10 i expected a lot more the tacos were small and had barely any meat on them the tortillas were stale and im pretty sure the greens topping them were expired my wife had the wedge salad and boneless wings which were both okay they drench the wings in sauce so they are super soggy when they come out about the only thing we liked were the pretzel sticks which im guessing are a frozen thing so not too hard to get right anywaythe food and service might deserve 23 stars but the restaurant doesnt for letting a particular balloon man wander around i posted a picture of the guy so if you see him make sure to say no thanks on the balloon animals i dont get mad easily and joke around quite a bit but this dude was a complete dbag he was making inappropriate jokes being rude and just acting like a complete jackass in front of my family including my 4 year old who he was making the balloon for had i not been with family there would have been a problem with the way this guy was acting i wont be coming back to this particular tgi fridays anytime soon if ever just because of him,0.0
the bagels here are extremely fresh and soft the cream cheese is always flavorful and the texture is perfect beware they will sell out many times i have come here past 11 and most of the bagels have been sold if you want the full selection come early or on a week day its definitely worth the trip,1.0
i started coming here for crossfit and i really like it  yes ive been sore everyday since starting but i know im getting a good workout the people here are really nice ive been going to the 930 am crossfit session and so far its ranged anywhere from 48 people in the class its almost like personal training in a group setting so i really enjoy that i bought a one month deal from the npr auction but ill most likely continue coming here after that expires because i like it better than my current gym and since the groups tend to be smaller you feel a sense of accountability when you dont go currently ive been going every other day because ive been so sore but eventually id like to work that up to 45 times a week it is a bit expensive so it definitely makes you want to go more often to get your moneys worth i thoroughly enjoy this place and the trainers here,1.0

one of the best pho restaurants in uptown toronto  food is flavourful with different varieties portions are good price is very fair  service is very good very attentive its a must try  a party of 5 including a kid we ordered bo la lop 2xlarge pho tom yum pho ga nuong bunfor vermicelli  the soup bases are good the meat is nice has good texture  you can choose dried or fresh rice noodles  the food looks good we totally forgot to take any photos  we fully enjoyed the food very much and cleared the table in no time  there are much more food in the menu that is normally not found in most vietnamese restaurants unless you go to the west end  my kid who is a picky eater said she wants to come backthe only negatives i found tonight were it was a bit hot in the restaurant hot day and a bit noisy when they blended juices otherwise its just superb,1.0

the food quantity to price at halibut house makes this very very poor value  very very small fish portions the chips are not chips in the classic sense  they are processed somewhere else frozen then fried in the store  nothing special  coleslaw nothing special  not in house tartar  i think the very rapid expansion of this chain is showing increasing problems in quality and attention it doesnt really feel like a family run business  hate the dcor  if anyone remembers h salt fish and chips  i think halibut house will disappear too  we will stick with places like harbord johns kingsway a little too snooty and pricey tho  and a fav of ours in shelburne ont hyland fish and chips rather than ever return here  i think there is room for scaling up by good fish and chip businesses but not 18 stores in 15 years feels commoditized  again fish portions are skimpy chips are not good,0.0
numerous times the baggers have not bagged all of my items its real irritating when i drive 20 minutes home to find out that my main ingredient to my dinner is missing what makes it more irritating is that when i go back to the store the cashier was very rude and tells me that i need my receipt i just drove 20 minutes back in a rush so that i can make dinner for my family i complain and she rudely interrupts me mid rant and tells me to just go back to the butcher and get another one so i go back there and theyre now out of what i need ugh im so irritated my advice is to check your bags before you leave the store on a good note though the lady at the butcher shop was very very understanding and kind she was able to get me what i needed thank you cindy i return to the check out to let them know that i got another package of hamburger and the customer service manager bryson doesnt say a word to me doesnt apologize for their mistake nor does he say thank you when he hands me my receipt great customer service sarcasm,0.0

really enjoyed the bubble tea here  staff behind the counter were patient kind and affable as there wasnt a big lineup the young gentleman behind the counter who really knew all about the teas took his time explaining to us each one as well as his top recommendations  really recommend any of their drinks especially the dragonfruit tapioca and the coffeeesque one both were superb  this place is underrated and ill definitely be back,1.0
so i read the reviews and as usual i dont pay too much attention to them because i like to make my own judgment on a place based on my experience so with that said i went in to the restaurant at 940 pm which is 20 minutes till close but they had over 12 employees working at what seemed full throttle which is typical for young folks trying to get off and out on a friday night i have to add that chipotle is one of my favorite places to get food and having children and bills its almost a treat to have being that for only me and my girlfriend it was 21 dollars i got to the restaurant and there was a line usually a line for chipotle but always moves fast i ordered 2 burritos chicken for my girl and steak for me so as he was making my burrito i asked for half barbocoa and half steak he asked if i wanted double meat or just half and half and i said half and half well the barbocoa pan was full of meat so he gave me a tong full and the steak pan had less than a big spoon full literally 5 little pieces of steak and rather than get something fresh from what they were cooking behind him he passed my burrito off to the next stage of the burrito making phase and as i stood there looking at the 2 burritos with the meat on the rice my girls burrito had almost triple the meat mine had so rather than be a jerk and make a complaint i just asked for double meat which the guy from the next phase of the burrito making he grabbed a heaping cup full of meat the little cups they usually put the salsa or other sides in and it was what the amount was for being a single meat burrito i asked him to go light on the hot salsa because lets face it that stuff can melt the paint off of a car if you tried lol but the guy put a whole ladle full i just shook my head to which he didnt notice and started wrapping my burrito after placing the other ingredients i asked for in it so final stage of the transaction of the burrito making production line the cash register guy asked if i wanted some chips or anything else i love the lime salted chips and of course said yes i didnt notice the size of the chips till i got home and to a great disappointment the chips were hardly filled to the bottom of the letters of the bag where it says chipotle  which you get more if you buy a 149 bag from the store so very disappointing and to have payed 21 dollars for food that was poorly put together and skimped on for chips and meat  which i had to pay double just to get what i should have gotten for the single meat price mind you also the non existing bag of chips i will make sure they never get my hard earned money ever again how could such an amazing chain become so non amazing over the last few years for me i know that i wont be going back to this location or any of their locations which is terrible because of this experience and i truly hope my review reaches out and makes someone think twice before they go overpaying for poor food and poor service at chipotle smh,0.0

very disappointed with the customer service at the pharmacyafter my dr sent over a prescription i headed here to pick it up  the clerk informed me that the prescription would need preauthorization from the insurance company so they sent it back to my dr to get that  okay that happens  ive been through the preauthorization process before with a different pharmacy and they obviously cant do anything until then i went back the next day  different clerk  still not authorized  she gave me more explanation some differing from what i had been told the day before and some new info  the likely timeframe 35 business days  i pointed out at the time that what she told me differed from what the other clerk had told me the day beforewas driving by after the 5th business day so i stopped by to check  same clerk as the second visit  still not authorized  okay  but then she gave me the spiel about the authorization process again but with more changes  she also added that theyd call me when it was ready  i pointed out that was the first time they said theyd call me  obviously i wouldnt have stopped in if i knew i was waiting for a call from them  the first clerk offered to text me but i dont have a phone that accepts text messages and without her then offering to call me i verified that i could call them to check  and this clerk hadnt mentioned it during my second visit  but she became adamant that she told me that the previous visit  she could remember our entire conversation from 6 days earlier  pretty amazing memory if you ask me given all the customers she must have dealt withi asked to speak to the pharmacy manager which was a worthless exercise  she kept trying to turn it into a discussion re they cant do anything until they get confirmation of the authorization  duh  instead of the fact that in three visits i couldnt get consistent information from the clerks that she supervises on their process once they get authorizationthe manager wouldnt even assure me of them calling me when the prescription was ready citing reasons  including freaks of nature or she could get hit by a car and die tonight  again duh  and supremely weirdto cvs heres an idea on what to say pieced together from information gleaned over three visits to this pharmacywe had to send this prescription back to your doctor because he needs to get preauthorization from your insurance company  we cant do anything further with this until we are notified that it has been preauthorized  this could take 35 business days or longer  once we have it ready we will call or text you  until you will need to contact your doctor directly to check on the status of thisshort  sweet  to the point  and apparently accurate although i might have to change it if i were to go back a fourth time  it would have saved me two tripsmy only other experience with this pharmacy was last fall when i stopped by for a flu shot  there were no customers at all in the pharmacy area and almost none in the entire store  yet i was told id have to wait 40 minutes  i didnt waitim new to instore cvs pharmacy visits and this store in particular  the manager and her clerks simply make cvs look bad  and ineptfollow up  i should have waited to post this  when i checked with my drs office re the status of the prescription and the insurance company they had no record of having been contacted initially or followup by this cvs pharmacy to let them know the insurance company was requiring preauthorizationwe ended up switching brands of insulin pens and the prescription was ready the day before i was heading out of townthat evening when i opened it up i discovered that they did not include any instructions  once i found instructions online i discovered that i needed to buy needles sold separately in order to use the pens  these folks knew that i was new to this  i told them and it said so on the prescription  i didnt have time to deal with this before heading out of town first thing the next morning delaying my starting to use insulin by almost three weeks  not goodbefore getting a refill i transferred the prescription to a different cvs store  that new store did include instructions with the insulin pens  they asked me for contact information so that they could call me when the refill was necessary  they asked me if i had needles  all without any promptingthat just made the cvs pharmacy at 7285 s durango dr looking all the more incompetent and terribly managed  too bad as its more convenient than the store i transferred it to  but ill trade off some convenience to avoid this pharmacys disastrous socalled service,0.0

came here today to put new tires that i purchased online on my summer rims staff was very helpful  was told that the tires i brought might rub and that theyd try one first to check before doing the rest  price was good too  kaltire wanted 50 per tire to mount and balance 17 tires  guess its more expensive if you dont buy the tires from them since they asked me if i bought the tires from them  then i called xtreme to see how much they charged and was told 2750 per tire  went there and watched them do it at the window  i found out it wasnt as simple as removing the tire and replacing it as i experienced at other places  as i watched them do each tire i thought to myself that 2750tire was definitely worth it for the work that was done  job took about an hour to do  i will definitely go back,1.0

typically i find hotels to nearly be the same all around the world however the residence inn tempe has comfortable rooms with plenty of outlets for electronic devices  and easy to reach and access the front desk staff and hotel service is the best experience everyone is ultra friendly there is paid parking connected to the hotel which is connected to your room key the hotel is adjacent to mill avenue with plenty of restaurants within walking distance there is a pool gym and whirlpool on the 11th floor it has an amazing view and had towels by the pool so your dont have to lug around towels from your room there is laundry on the 2nd floor with state of the art washersdryers my room had a full kitchenette and full size refrigerator you could not ask for more prices are a bit high compared to other locations but perhaps worth the cost if you want a nicely kept property and convenience of nearby attractions,1.0

we frequent easy life boba anytime we are in the area andor really craving a delicious refreshing drink  i always get the same thing which is a peach slush they are great for hot summer days and nights here in vegas  i dont recommend hanging out there in the shop it is very hot in my opinion   maybe this is just due to the sweltering summer heatwho knows or by design to give extra incentive to get an ice cold drink once inside  either way dont let that persuade you not to try one  definitely a must try for all boba lovers out there,1.0

amazing nice ppl  car buying experience by far this place is seriously the antistereotypical dealership steve was extremely accomodating and easy going he gave me a way better deal than the 6 other places i went to the entire process was comfortable and the nice ambience and total attention made it actually feel like a special experience i was hesitant at first but the kudos to steve had me try it out he is the man full of integrity and has that pride and stake in the organization that makes you want to support local people rather than huge corporations dropped off car and paperwork during my lunch gave me a much better rate than the credit union ive paid off more than 8 cars with they run a lean operation no high overhead fees etc you owe it to yourself to make buying a car an easy rewarding experience thanks so much steve and co,1.0

so the last time i was here was july 2006 and now i know why  the place itself is cute in a very dated way  the service was very good but the food is nothing to rave about at all  we ordered a house salad that came out almost as a soup because of how much dressing was on it same went for the chicken marsala drowned in sauce you had to search for the chicken  ordered a side of penne with oil and garlic there was so much garlic you could keep vampires away for a lifetime deeming it inedible and the pasta was not cooked well either to boot  the others we dined with seemed to like their food but all complained about things drowning in sauces and lack of real flavors  with so many options in tempe and the surrounding area just go somewhere else for italian food,0.0
tot cafe closed downtemporarily so i found this place compared to tot cafe this cat cafe is cleaner and more comfortable the cats roam around the entire store you only need to order one drink 5 its a few dollars cheaper than tot the vanilla ice latte is good the cats only wanted my treats lol they seem to liven up and follow you when treats were involved but they seemed friendlier than the orphan cats at tot when i reach out to pet some of the tot cats they would do that flexible cat bending thing and slide these cats are owned by the store owners so maybe thats why theyre not as unfriendly beware of coco the fatty she kept begging for treats there was an interesting one with a grumpy face and snagged tooth it would watch you from far wanting a treat but then you approach and it runs away lol,0.0
ive heard so much about this place and im so mad that i havent had it and i literally drive by it everyday first time for me had the donair pizza but really wanted to try 1 of every pizza they had for pizza by the slice what more can i saybut go try it for yourself you will not be disappointedits really that good full of toppings and oh so much cheese i wish i wouldve got one more slice  all positives for megood job seniore,1.0
check out their website  they have a great selection and even more to choose from at their warehouse  the photos and descriptions on their website are realistic to what you will find at their warehouse  they are in an industrial area but still easy to find  great prices and terrific selection  they have seasonal items on special too  i should have bought that autumn wreath i saw on my way out the door ,1.0
they have multiple lifted trucks on their website which lead you to believe they are on sale with huge end of year discounts  however they said it was a misprint and that it would be another 840000 on top of the internet price  the sales rep antonio tried to appologize but really didnt say much more  frustrated with the incorrect information on the web as there were three of these trucks that they are saying are priced wrong i decided to test drive another truck  it took him 20 minutes to find the key and actually get the truck   after taking a look at the truck i decided i wanted to test drive  he gave push back when i asked for him to actually get a dealer test drive plate  once he got the plate we got on the freeway and the tires were out of balance in which the response was they just need air  this wasnt the worst part though while driving he received a call from another customer and spoke with him for the rest of the test drive  i must not be very important as you can see  we finally get back to the dealership in which i asked what the numbers would look like  i decided to stay outside to look over the truck further  after about 25 minutes we decided to go inside its hot out in august only to find out the sales agent was working on pulling details for the other client that he spoke with during the test drive  after this happened he decided to finally go and get me a numbers sheet  that took forever as well i was fed up and got up to leave  this is when i met keyon he was real with us and actually answered and helped me for a few minutes with a couple of questions i had  unfortunately we were still unable to make a deal  i love the fact that there is a chevy dealership down the road from my house now however id love to have more confidence in this dealership which will be difficult after my expereince tonight  i understand we all have off nights but this seemed more about the commission and the sale for antonio as opposed to working with the client and working with my needs,0.0
i should have read the reviews before going to this place  now im added to the victim list  they deserve 0 star  looks like its a problematic business for years  if you want to take care of your garments do not come to this place i experienced the same things the previous yelpers did  they ruined my all white burberry dry coat the following ways1 an abrasion on the left sleeve area the fabric has a obvious scratched line on it 2 the inner lining with the burberry brand label and signature pattern on it the colour is bleached out of the pattern the whole big area is damaged to a point that is nonreparable now the lining looks like its an old pairs of jeans that was washed over 100 times 3 got a new black stain on the right sleeve area it was not there when i brought it in it appeared after the first wash in may i saw this and agreed for a second wash as remedy then the stain spread after the second wash when i was asked to give a third chance to remove the stain i agreed with the condition that if there is any risk of damaging the coat it should not be washed and i shall be notified immediately i was not notified the coat was not ready for pick up twice after a given ready date today i found that during the delay pauline the staff made the call to inquire and was told that it was being soaked the label on the coat clearly stated specialist dry cleaning only soaking should not be taken place again if specialist dry cleaning were not possible at your plant i should be notified the coat should be returned untouched from the second wash like all others i was told to contact riz i emailed him i called and left messages he just ignored me  i reported this to the better business bureau recently and the next step will be bringing it to the small claim courtaccording to what they have promoted on their official business website after contacting them about the damage they will conduct a thorough and timely investigation sadly it was not my case i have been calling leaving messages in store and in voicemail and emailing for a week without a single respond it cannot be called timely they also promoted their level of customer care as attention to detail and care is paramount in ensuring the clients expectations are met and exceeded at the preeners custom fabricare a satisfied client is the foremost objective all strategies and efforts are geared to ensure that this happens again i experienced the opposite i have been trying to contact a manager i was told rees is the only manager who takes care of complains for more than a week i still receive no response by any meansthis company have issues with cleaning service customer service warranty promises and false advertisement on their website when i see all other victims having the same issue i would like all of you who are interested in pursuing justice to contact me  we have to be gathered together to have a voice  we have to do something to stop this preeners scam going on in our city and get back the compensation we deserve,0.0

my husband picked this place and i was nervous because i tend to like westernized japanese food you know those rolls with cream cheese and sweet sauce and while ive never been to japan yuzu seemed like it would be rather authentically japanese i was wrong to be nervous  everything we got was delicious we ate the homemade tofu fried version a bento box matts roll black sesame pudding he loved it i didnt and a strawberry mochi only one  i could have eaten 6 while i liked matts roll i wouldnt get it again in favor of trying something new based on our experience id guess everything at yuzu is good and id rather try things that are more subtle this was one of those overthetop sushi rolls that strike me as very american  i was happily surprised with yuzu and would love to go back,1.0

i went in to the store with one shoe in mind and left with another thats because the owner took his time to find out what it was i needed and  not what i wanted and with his knowledge of his product and the local job requirements etc he got me exactly the boot i needed sure these boots are expensive these are high quality made in the usa there are some made in china but they are less expensive built to last and backed by red wing try taking a pair of boots back to walmart to be oiled or for new laces both services are free at red wing theyll look at you crosseyed or try getting a pair of insert chinese made brand here boots resoled good luckall in all i was extremely pleased with the experience at the store and with the boots i was sold thats right i was sold a pair of boots by a knowledgeable salesman who took the time to fit me correctly and educate me about his product i didnt walk in to a big box store and get no service from underpaid inexperienced and untrained attendants if you can find one and buy a pair of boots at a bargain price only to have to go back in a few months to buy another pairthe boots i bought should last approximately 2 years or more multiply the number of bargain boots id go through in that time frame and the cost is the same if not cheaper and ive got a better boot with better foot and ankle support translate that to less or no foot pain after a long day on my feetif your looking for a quality boot this is the place to go but be prepared to get what you paid for,0.0

real estate agents and homeowners  buyer beware if your real estate agent gives you this company to consider for your home warranty i recommend picking anyone else this is my second horrible experience with these people for 2 separate pool related equipment issues my prior review on 10716 laid out how this company says on their website they wont be overreaching in their use of preexisting as a rejection reason but they will tell you that it isnt covered due to preexisting even if you had a home inspection done and paid the extra addon for the pool equipment the newest denied claim was on 51917 being under their warranty for nearly 7 months they couldnt use preexisting to deny this claim instead they said that it was their opinion that it was caused by poor maintenance they also claim on their website they are liberal on covering claims where prior homeowners maybe didnt maintain things as well as they should have that is a lie too i tried to work with dawn at one guard since she provided me a little assistance with the pool heater once i blasted them on yelp they gave half towards that repair even approaching them proactively did no good dawn said she would get back to me after having management review the claim again that followup never happened this issue was where a de filter for the pool developed cracks on the fiberglass shell then causing the other pool equipment to get flooded and trip the circuit breaker they blamed my weekly pool guy yes i have it professionally maintained on a weekly basis  that wasnt good enough for them either that he must have caused the filter to dead head however two separate professional pool repair people said that was false because it had a pressure value that prevents the system from blowing up since one guard wouldnt be professional and operate with integrity to cover this claim i had to quickly have others come in and fix my system since the pool was going green i spent over 1200 to repair everything and get the pool clear again i understand the policy has a 1000 limit maybe after seeing the scathing review they come to their senses and reimburse me the 1000 for something they should have fixed in the first place,0.0

last year my sweety bought me a spa day for xmas from this salon  i went for the treatment which included a facial a body wrap massage and mani pedi  the services were great and i became a fan of this place immediately  after checking on what other services they provide i came across the lash extention option  i have done this in the past with others service providers and was suprised to see that they offer the service at 150 for initial visit then 50 for upkeep appointments i had always been charged 250 and 100 so i took the chance and got the lashes  nancy is the lash girl and she is absolutely adorable reliable super accomadating and available and she does a very good job  i highly recommend this place for this service it is less expensive and she does a good job i have also used their services for a mise en plis and have been quite happyanother plus for this place is that they have these vip evenings for their clients every now and again to have an information session the event usually has some food and wine and prizes and gifts which is a really nice way to show their clients they carethis is a salonschool and you can choose the person pro or student which can mean saving some money  the salon is very bright and clean and in a great easy access location on prince arthur  if you or anyone you know is looking for some tlc spa services at an affordable price this should be your first stop,1.0
so good officially my favorite pho place in arizona  looks like a holeinthewall from the outside but those always end up being the most delicious places the coconut water came in an actual coconut that we ate and it was really tasty and fresh and it was very refreshing  for my pho i ordered off the menu with the better grade meat and got the one with everything in it and added oxtail  i tasted the broth before seasoning it and it was everything but bland you could really taste the flavor of the meats that were cooked in it and if i wasnt so addicted to sriracha i wouldve eaten it plain  i also asked for half noodles something i always do because i cant finish and for once i actually had 70 meat and 30 noodles bottom line this place does not skimp out on meat like most other places do i had so much meat that i barely finish it and that is rare for me  one thing that stood out the most to me and my friend who ordered the tendon and brisket pho was the quality if the tendon it was flavorful and had just the right texture so you know it was fresh and not overcooked to the point where it was mushy  the only thing i couldve done without was the oxtail because it was kind of a pain to eat with so many people around the place is big with plenty of seating and almost packed so we had to share a long table with another group so if youre not into that dont come on a weekend afternoon im definitely going to be frequenting this place even though it is 30 minutes from me and i cant wait try more items off their menu,1.0

my gf and i come here about once a month and we are never disappointed  the food is excellent  i usually get the sukiyaki and she gets the shabu shabu  if you get the sukiyaki i have some recommendations  first order the raw egg with the meal  crack the egg into the small bowl they give you with the egg then beat to mix the egg yoke and white together  when you pull a piece of cooked food out of the hot pot dip it in the egg then eat  when i dip a piece of the cooked meat in the egg then put it in my mouth it melts  so good and theres nothing else like it  i would also recommend that you order a side of mushrooms and udon noodles to add to your hot pot  check the web site for specials,1.0
first off id like to say i was prepared for a long wait because of other yelpers but thankfully i was out of baggage claim at 725 am and at the hotel before 8 am we prepaid for the shuttle online and instructions told us exactly where the supershuttle booth was upon arriving at the booth no one was there but thats ok because according to our confirmation if the terminal 3 booth was unoccupied a number was given to call the terminal 1 booth the first call went straight to voicemail so i called again and a lady picked up and put me on hold she was apparently helping another customer i was on hold for maybe 5 minutes or less not her fault i think she was the only worker as soon as i got off the phone within 3 minutes  a van pulled up the driver was pleasant and informed us of one more stop at terminal 1 we waited a few minutes at terminal 1 but i think the person we were picking up canceled i was watching his screen it should 3 pickups my boyfriend myself and the 3rd party but then the 3rd person disappeared the driver apologized and said i guess we came here for nothing and then we were on our way the driver dropped us off right in front of the check in doors grabbed our luggage for us and walked away without a tip but my boyfriend grabbed him before he left because he was good to us even providing tips about timeshare people and safety here,0.0

they called me in nov 2015 asking me to take the paper at a discount i agreed and after 4 weeks i called because i had not received the paper yet  they assured it would start but it never did i called again a few weeks later and asked for a refund and they basically begged me not to cancel and to give them one more chance very unprofessional and i refused several times and finally demanded a supervisor so i wouldnt have to keep repeating no please cancel and give me a refund they would not transfer me to a supervisor and promised to have one call back of course one never did i received refund mid january and of course it is for less than half the amount they charged me in nov remember i never received even one paper delivered  so i call again to a land far away where they cant understand what im saying and they say they will turn it over to some dept and in 57 days they will get back to me  i will never sign up againtheir customer service is outsourced and crappy and it is not worth the headache,0.0
i was at this tony romas on nov 21 2011 for there 1299 steak n lobster with family and three of us order the same special but i guess you get for what you pay my steak and  was so bad that it was full of fat hard to chew was so disappointed that even my sisters and my boyfriends was just as bad my sister mentioned to the server after he came to our table and asked us how everything was and as soon as my sister mentioned the steak was rubbery and he just ignored us and just walked away i will say that he also took a long time to bring us our check let alone never came back to collect the check after he dropped it off  i was so disappointed that i should have walked away without paying because no one seem to notice but of course im not a person to do that so i had to find someone to take my money so i went straight to there greeter   the one thing i will say is i did not leave a tip to our server this place already charged me enough for a rubbery full of fat no meat steak that the service did not deserve a tip i will never come to any of the tony romas since they are over priced anyways   so dont waste your money on the special,0.0

this buffet is worth the hype we lucked out by not having to wait as we went on a wednesday morning about 10 am so avoided the crowds the place was busy but not overrun the dcor was beautiful and tranquil keeping in line with everything else at cosmopolitan the only complaint was that if you dont read the directional signs you will get lost in the labyrinth of the hotel but thats to be expected in vegasnow to the foodone wordimpeccable every morsel of food shows the quality of choice ingredients and the pride of the culinary team the eggs benedict which are a challenge at any type of buffet were among the best ive ever had the angry mac and cheese was a unique bite the chicken breakfast sausages were delectable try the salmon caper pizza so different we shared all the little portions so that we could experience as much as possible but still couldnt try it all or even close toword to the wise save room for dessert ive never seen a selection like this and even though the portions are small and we shared them we still couldnt try all that we wanted to the gelato bar was terrific and the chef was willing to put tiny amounts in the dish so you wouldnt feel bad about trying multiple flavoursloved this buffet and wouldnt dream of going back to vegas and not making time for it,0.0

in a wordserenewhat can i say about the hyatt regency scottsdale resort and spa  gainey ranchit was our first trip to the phoenixscottsdale area and if you enjoy the simple luxuries of a shortrefreshing weekend to get away from it all this is the place to stay the property is secluded but yet a short drive to the main area of downtown scottsdale the service is wonderful there were checkin kiosks and plenty of receptionists it was a midafternoon checkin the rooms were clean modern and typical of business style hotel as most hyatts sheratons and other hotels of the sort what stood out to us was the setting the hotel as you drive up has a large fountain in the middle of square yes not circular driveway and the hotel is just plain open you can see the large sitting area where at night people gather to drink mingle and even roast marshmallows beyond that is what is a large pool area 1 adult only pool and a generallarge all ages pool area more about that in a minuteif you veer to the right of the pool area and behind it is this small yet peaceful garden and beyond that was a full golf course now the piece du resistance for me anyways is the expansive pool area the pool has the typical hottub poolside bar but beyond that it has small basketball hoop two volleyball nets a sandy beach section a couple of waterfalls and a 3 story water slide excellent now could it have been the weather was beautiful 80 degrees in late october combined with one of my favorite pluses to a hotel a large pool area honestly a pool area to either bathe in the sun sip a lovely beverage or dip in the pool to me thats a holiday even if it was a short weekend getaway holiday none the less right the pool being expansive yet it didnt feel too large or overwhelming with tons of other hotel guests doing the same because then i wouldve gone to the adult only you would expect the pool area to be popular rightfor checkout there are two major pluses 1 it has a computer with printer so you can print your boarding passes for your flight home and it has spots for rental care return as for the spa my girlfriends sister made use of its services and for me i stepped into the reception area for nor more than five minutes with the combination of near whispering of the staff the soft gentle music and the rock laden water fountain i wanted to sit in of the comfy chairs and fall asleepbut you dont have to take my word for it in essence if you stay in the phoenix scottsdale area whether for a short weekend or long holiday this has to be one of the choices to stay,0.0

mon ami no more  i loved this restaurant  seriously  with all my heart and souli loved the view the ambiance the waiters the food and the je ne se quoi sp and i had had a longstanding relationship with this restaurant visiting at least 23 times a year for the past 45 years  it was love at first bite and i never made a trip to vegas without visiting at least once  now im afraid to say im not likely to go back  on a recent visit near the end of december i was excited to bring 3 friends to mon ami  now while the restaurant is known as a steakhouse they offer many fish dishes on their menu  on the night we came in with an 8 pm reservation we were informed that they were out of all of them  the waitress quickly let us know very unapologetically that they were out of lobster mussels skate trout salmon scallops and any other fish on the menu that evening  we were hellbent on getting the mussels one of our favorite appetizer dishes at mon ami and one of our visitors had his heart set on lobster  when we asked why there was no fish available when clearly it was largely offered on the menu the waitress simply answered our fish truck didnt come today  now mistakes happen  the world is an imperfect place  fish trucks miss their deliveries  i am not a restaurateur though i know one in the henderson area but i would imagine that a restaurant of this size with the volume of business that mon ami does  would have a back up plan should a truck not arrive  if not might i suggest that there is a whole foods store less than 3 miles away where perhaps they might have gone to pick up some fish  after expressing our disappointment the waitress shared that she heard a rumor that some mussels had come in and she would bring them to us right away  she did we ate them they tasted gummy and fishy and we complained about them for the rest of our trip  after eating steaks con frites umm what else were we supposed to eat at that point we left disappointed with the restaurants lack of selection and poor planning but mostly with how their staff chose to handle the situationwithout any true apologies or sense of ownership    unacceptable for a longtime ami,0.0
have been here several times every time the same experience  extraordinarily rude owners who get simple orders wrong last time i ordered lox and cream cheese on a bagel  i got a bagel with lox and no cream cheese  today i ordered 2 bagels with lox and cream cheese  the owner reached for 1 bagel and began to weigh the lox i watched i spoke up again 2 bagels with lox and cream cheese please the owner kept working  she put the 1 bagel into a bag turned around and began to work the cash register  i said now for the 3rd time id like 2 bagels with lox and cream cheese please  she said that is exactly what i gave you a bagel with 2 slices of lox  you just cant make this up  the place is in the bagel business and they have zero idea how people eat bagels and what people want with their bagels when the owner finally made me the 2nd bagel with lox and cream cheese and after i had paid her she said the words that every person who orders lox and cream cheese on a bagel is waiting to here  those come with potato chips,0.0

we visited on a weekday morning and had the place completely to ourselves for about half an hour the employee gave great directions and showed us several examples and sample products she showed us where all the supplies were located and then left us to our projects this was my daughters first time at a pottery painting place and she loved it they have a wide variety of items to select with something to fit any budget speaking of budget we also learned that they have special days that they waive their fees or that you can get discounts on pottery you can find the calendar of specials as well as events in the store or on their website turn around time to pick up was 4 days for us we didnt need our items urgently but its worth keeping in mind that you wont be walking away with a finished product that same day plan ahead if youre making something as a gift and need it by a certain date we were very happy with the final appearance of our items it was also a lot of fun so well plan to return,1.0

this place was excellent while i was craving comfort food and went straight for their pepperoni pizza my dinner mates each ordered steaks for appetizers we had the meat and cheese platter and the spinach and artichoke dip one of my favorite appetizers so i get it almost everywhere this place gets first prize it was incredible three of us split two sides the creamed corn and the mac n cheese and it was enough for all of us to go with our wellportioned mealstheir motto is something like simple food done right and i truly cant agree with that statement more everything i tried from here was top notch and hands down one of the best things id ever tried but nothing was over complicatedfor dessert none of us could decide which one we wanted the most so we each got two overall at our table we had the orange bar the peanut butter cheesecake the panna cotta the smores the champagne shaved ice and the passion fruit mousse each one was delicious in its own way and the dessert portions were small enough to merit two desserts each my favorite ended up being the passion fruit mousse my only gripe was the server im not sure if this is a restaurantwide policy or if it was just our server who did this but any time we would ask about an item on the menu are the sides large enough to share how is the waygu beef aged she would answer our question and then list off her favorites from that section of the menu even though we never asked for suggestions and because we had questions about each major section i could walk in there right now and order an entire meal for her from start to finish she was very nice but that kind of information wasnt asked for nor was it relevant to anything we did ask,1.0

we went for a late dinner with some friends and when i say late i mean 45 minutes before closing the staff was so accommodating and friendly for the four of us we got 3 naans one order of nihari beef chunks in a stew haleem a dish made of slow cooked meat lentils and spices and a kashmiri tea the food portions were generous and we were quite stuffed nihari the beef was so tender and the flavor really penetrated the chunks with the naan soaking up all the delicious sauce haleem although we couldnt find it on the menu the waiter said they had it and it was better than expected the meat lentils and spices were cooked so long that they had blended into each other it was soooo good i would recommend asking for some fresh ginger cilantro and lime on the side to freshen it up a bit still quite delicious the waiters bring by chill is that are grilled and salted one of the 4 got a spicy one but they are generally jalapeo level of spice if youre ok with that there is a bottle of yoghurt sauce and tamarind sauce on the table that i would imagine goes well with biryani or samosas will go back,1.0

we decided to give this restaurant a try to celebrate my fathers 88th birthday we sat out on the magnificent terrace with heaters and had one of the most enjoyable dinning experiences in scottsdalewhere to begin our waiter tyler was so pleasant and professional he recommended a few dishes and we ended up trying 16 im total for 5 of us the quality of the ingredients the presentation and taste was faultless we all found the dishes to be reasonably priced and each one was absolute heaven we chose 5 vegetables and its the first time in az that the brussels have been cooked perfectly blanched and then grilled the bison carpaccio is so delicate the lamb tacos truly scrumptious the bass was a true highlight all is so fresh that it is hard to really have a winner the chicken flatbread was my mothers preferred choice she only eats chickenupon parking they asked the reason for the visit and one of the 5 desserts arrived with a personal birthday message wonderful touch to a truly magical evening thank you to everyone and especially the chef who took the time to come out and meet us i think she was truly impressed by the quantity of food we ordered shes worked under brinkley but i truly believe the food on offer tonight was far superior to her place of training,1.0
one of my favorite spots in pittsburgh certainly a hidden gem i of course have to comment on the absolute delicious wedding soup its hard to find good wedding soup in a restaurant its usually either bland or too salty but big jims gets it just right theyre other dishes are equally yummy and the portions are always huge love the pasta with white clam sauce  so many clams  have also eaten the gnocchi but ordered it with a marinara rather than the meat sauce they took a bit long to cook but were well worth the wait also all pasta dishes come with a yummy warm and buttery garlic toast have also tried steak sandwich and the premium grilled chicken sandwich which are both also good the bread is fabulous have never been hungry enough for dessert but im sure it would rock,1.0
we rented out the barrymore for our wedding in may of 2017 from day 1 the service was unmatched i had reached out to numerous places in vegas and most were unwilling to compromise andor had pushy sales people kuuipo at the barrymore was a godsend she was kind thoughtful and extremely helpful from the very first contact the venue is absolutely beautiful and the food is to die for we were treated like royalty by the entire staff ive never experienced service like that at any restaurant or venue and i work in that industry the cost is very reasonable for the level of service and quality of food we were truly blown away and our wedding went off perfectly they even sent us a thank you card and cookies from hawaii were we had our hooneymoon thank you to kuuipo and the entire barrymore staff for making our dreams a reality and supporting us along the way,1.0

wow amazingbusker fest brings buskers from all over the world and to entertain torontonians with their wide range of talentsbuskersmy favourite was definitely stuntdouble circushttpwwwstuntdoublecircuscomthey were acrobatics that were really entertaining their skit had 5 sections and there was audience interaction their show was very fast paced and kept wowing the audience  they nailed every act and were very gracious for donations given to themthey even gave a free tshirt for each 20 donation there are 4 guys and so they would have to split each donation 4 wayssome other buskers seemed to have a chip on their shoulder like the audience owed them something  i guess its difficult not knowing how much money people will donate and having your life depend on other peoples decisionswait a sec all jobs are like that to a degreefeeit was free and you could choose to donate to the event this year they were supporting epilepsyi think this notion of having the event free is better because then the audience feels more inclined to donate to the performers since they are not being paid by the festivalit was a very enjoyable evening and i will definitely go next year,1.0

beautiful decor and  crowd is mixed we had a reservation for 8 pm on a thursday night we arrived 10 minutes before and the hostess told us that our reservation was for 815 which was not true because i booked it and said 8 pm she said we can only sit in the lounge area where we can only have drinks no appetizers this was a completely wasted birthday dinner it was 823 pm we decided to leave since there was no signs of that table being available when the hostess realized that we are leaving she said she can offer us crackers  anyways the manager was there and saw the whole thing didnt say anything seemed he didnt care food might be good i cant say but service was horrible it on of those cool fancy looking places that you go in but the staff is cold and arrogant and you just want to get up and leave,0.0

i was completely skeptical about phoenix ranch market when my wife said we were going to go check it out last week so skeptical that i told her i didnt want to go in all honesty what could possibly be so good about a little grocery store in a not particularly good part of downtown phoenix after all everything prices lower than walmart the largest selection of 89 cent pastries ive ever seen several small restaurants full cows heads for only 4999 a vast selection of specialty items most grocery stores dont carry much of hispanic stuff fruits vegetables plus its probably the most clean grocery store ive ever been in while we dont live close enough to make this our goto grocery store i can guarantee youll see us here several times a month from now on five big fat ones for sure,0.0

ahwhere to beginsage is a treasure hubs and i were treated to a trip to vegas following our beautiful sonoma county wedding aka our honeymoon in november 2011 i did a lot of research beforehand and used trusty yelp to make my decision on where to dine for our fancy night out the word fancy always reminds me of squidward for some reasoni settled on sage after much research into price location menu and general yelp happiness i will say that their tasting menu and wine pairing were mostly what made me decide on this restaurant our close friends gave us a generous wedding gift certificate to aria to assist with the cost as well so needless to say we were well on our way to maximum enjoymentwe went early to expand our meal options since they offer another tasting menu for early diners we started with a few martinis grey goose dirty martini for me while we soaked up the atmosphere posh is how i would describe it and pleasantly lit we had forgotten to go grab our gift certificate from the front desk and the host went to grab it for us when my husband was getting up to grab it when hubs tried to tip him for the service he refused the tip and said just doing my job big score for sages staff thereour waiter was very nice and attentive which didnt change even when the restaurant got busier we ended up ordering the 79 tasting menu with wine pairing hubs and i each got something different off the tasting menu so we could get the full scope of the menu so happy that we didits been about 8 months so i cant remember everything but here were the highlights of the mealbread they had some bread that had bacon in it to die for even better though i know how does it get better than bacon was the butter it was lavender butter whipped and creamy and orgasmic i was a little buzzed so i though nothing of sticking my finger in the bowl and cleaning up the tidbits that remained i have never been so impressed with bread and butterwagyu beef tartare ive already used orgasmic so lets go with phenomenal on this seriously i still have dreams of finding something this good ever again a poached egg sits a top this yummy pile of raw meat and once pierced oozes its gooey goodness down into the rest of the goodness what a treatscallops i dont remember exactly how they were prepared the wine pairing is quite a doozy fair warning but i remember that they were really tasty and not overcooked  which is a huge gripe i have over the preparation of scallops48 hour pork belly again im going to blame this on the alcohol but i dont remember too much here but that it was excellent and we were getting very full hubs and i both ordered this one and yummed it all upand i honestly dont remember too much more than that but hey its vegas righteverything was paced well and the staff had great patience for our slow going our waiter even sent the sommelier over to chat with us once when we mentioned that we were from sonoma county and hubs worked at a boutique winery in russian river valleyoverall great experience staff and food the 400 price tag including tip was worth it,1.0

there are so many things to recommend this shop 1 the people who staff it are  kind fun helpful and enthusiastic 2 they encourage trying samples of everything 3 the flavours are gorgeous  so much of the time ice cream is too sweet and not flavourful enough that was not the case here 4 there are multiple vegan offerings and they go beyond simple overly sweet fruit sorbets 5 the ice creams are all made carefully and with great attention to flavour texture and ingredients we were delighted with our visit and we look forward to the next outing for icecream what a wonderful perfect treat highly recommend,1.0

we took a cheap cab ride to buffalo wild wings or bdubs as the locals call it it is kind of far from the strip and not worth walking to unless you are that bored  the great thing about bdubs are the sauces  they have about 20 different flavors  we ordered 24 boneless wings in spicy garlic and medium hot buffalo chips fried garlic shrooms and some fat tires to drink  it was waaaay too much food for two drunk people  my favorite thing that we ordered were the buffalo chips  they are not crispy but more like fries cut into little pieces of chiplike heaven  our bartender was really nice and made some great suggestions  she was also from the yay area  our meal was really cheap too  another reason to hit up bdubs on your next trip to vegas,1.0

i was sooo looking forward to it and i was sooo thouroughly disappointed you might think that you are going to get something at least approaching a smoked meat sandwich with that thinly shaved meaty salty nitrite filled goodness that you have come to expect from a smoked meat sandwich with the meat bursting out from under the rye toast but youd be horribly disappointingly infuriatingly wrongwhat you get instead is some disgustingly unappetizing days old thick cut something that consists at least 50 gristle connective tissue and uncooked whitish fat and you know beef fat isnt that appetizing to begin with  but that is what you got to contend withthe only redeeming part of this meal would be the crisp pickle or the option to throw it right back in the vendors face if that were legal which it should be in this casei would suggest that you stay clear of this truck and if you really have a hankering for street meat go look for one of those disgusting sausages at any corner hotdog vendor  believe me youll get better value for your 350 canadian there than you would here for three times the priceyouve been warned,0.0

this place is ridiculous  for the record the view is really nice and worth seeing but the food is atrocious  its not that the ideas for a particular dish arent interesting its that the meats cuts and vegetables are flavorless andor terrible  for a 35 salmon dish the salmon dish was farmed  farmed salmon at a restaurant like this  what are they trying to pass off on us  moreover the wine list was terrible  so the view may be good but if i remember correctly you go to restaurants for food  but apparently the restaurateurs who conceived the elements dont subscribe to this philosophy,0.0

i have to agree with everything wade f said the service was slow skimpy portions excessive sweet sauce applied to sushi you barely see the fish in the white tuna roll most of the fried dishes was over cooked and dry with the all you can eat pricing they werent too generous on their service you get more rice than fish after trying a few rolls i just couldnt eat anymore because of the sweet sauce they put in almost all the sushi rolls it was way too sweet for my taste i got a bad vibe from the wait staff when i wanted to order more food just got a funny look from him  kinda made me feel guilty for order more food trying this place once is enough for me,0.0
my delivery order was placed over the phone but i got their menu via allmenuscom i called at 312pm and was immediately asked if i could hold i agreed and then they set the phone down on the counter and i could hear everything three minutes later not too long he came back and i ordered our pizza along with cheese sticks i was given my total and told it would be there in 45 minutes because i got stuffed pizza and it takes a bit longer to cookone hour and 15 minutes later my fiance asks me again how long they said it would take and that is generally my cue to call them back and see whats up i call back am immediately again asked to hold i said well its just about the order i just placed im wondering where it is their response was let me get a manager five minutes later the manager gets on the phone and i let him know that theyre 30 mins late he apologizes doesnt offer to comp anything and tells me he should be there any minute10 minutes later a knock at the door the driver asks me if i have a pen that doesnt happen very often  very disorganized i sign and let him goi open up the cheese sticks and its a hoagie roll split in half with cheese and herbs on it it wasnt cut up at all and so not worth the 7 paid for itthe pizza was a buffalo chicken pizza i enjoy buffalo wings a lot and we generally enjoy buffalo chicken pizzas as well the buffalo sauce on this was so spicy that my fiance couldnt handle it honestly if you go to a place like buffalo wild wings id rank the sauce near their spiciest if youre going to use a sauce that spicy on a pizza there should be a warning or do something to cool it off by adding ranch dressing to the pizza as well glass nickel does this and its wonderfulin fact we promptly ordered 1 pizza from glass nickel and the pizza was here and hot in under 20 mins,0.0

terrible  dont waste your time  my husband called these guys to fix our dishwasher 3 days before a big dinner party  we both rushed home from work to meet the scheduled technician at 530 the tech never showed up  my husband called the company and someone who called himself a scheduling guy answered a cell phone super abrupt said he was too busy in the line at the bank to help coordinate the details and pretty much hung up on my husband  my husband thought they were disconnected called the guy back only to hear the guy call him rude for interrupting his time at the bank my husband apologized and they guy said it was too late and he was cancelling our appointment  seriously  your company noshows at a job insults customers and then cancels our appointment  wow,0.0
ive been to eat here twice now for lunch and every time im shocked that its not more crowded  there is a 10 lunch special featuring 6 or 7 different dishes that come with a spring roll and a drink  i ordered the drunken noodles this time which came out fast and looked great  they tasted as good as they looked especially with the house cilantro lime hot sauce which added some delightful acidity both my coworkers were equally pleased with their pad thai and namprik  there was so much food on the plate it was easily enough for two meals  we took boxes of leftovers home with us  for what we paid it feels like one of the best lunch specials in townthe wait staff is very attentive and helpful and our server even gave us drinks in to go cups at her suggestion  its in a bit of an out of the way corridor of noda near the construction but very much worth the trip for the price and value  there is parking in a lot out front which is very convenient  i would definitely make this a destination for lunch and dinner as well,1.0
we had an amazing evening at big rock brewery  we had a group of about 20 and they we toured through the facilities in two groups  so interesting and entertaining great tidbits of info all the way through  did some shopping in the gift store after  some wonderful gift ideas and did a bit of christmas shopping  the cost of the tour includes a big rock beer glass too  great idea for groups of any size  they are very accommodating,1.0
we had 25 hours till our flight and decided to eat here for breakfast we were seated quickly about ten minutes later we got our coffee and ordered our breakfast it was taking a while but we werent super rushed so it seemed fine 40 minutes later we still had not received our breakfast and noticed people who had come in after us were eating we asked our server to check on it for us but she brushed us off saying the food takes about 20 minutes we had already been waiting 40 and seen everyone else around us served the food so we were pissed that she dismissed us finally she came up and said she would check on it for us then the manager came up and said the kitchen lost our ticket we would have been ok with that had it been dealt with earlier but the fact that no one would even check was irritating then the food comes out one of the orders was incorrect but we ate it because at this point wed been waiting an hour check came quickly no discount for the inconvenience i was surprised at that we both wished we had seen the starbucks earlier and gotten a breakfast sandwich there i know its an airport but i dont really think that should be an excuse for such poor service and poor accountability for that poor service i would not recommend this place,0.0

very clean place friendly owners that seem to know everyone by first name and their order food is excellent we only regret not trying this place before today this is not a fast food establishment and seating is limited however take out is an option and well worth it i would highly recommend this place especially the green chili burrito and must try the rice and beans hands down the best we have tasted in az,1.0
got a coupon in the mail for delias cleaners and who doesnt love a coupon  it had 30 off on cleaning with the exception of certain items which did not pertain to my items  i entered and asked how much a blouse would be  the young lady said 525 and up  i had two blouses and one pair of pants  she looked at one blouse and said oh this is a premium blouse so this will be 710  i then showed her my coupon  i expected 30 off the quoted price wouldnt you  she goes to the register with my coupon punches in some numbers and says oh the premium blouse is 1025 but with the coupon its 710  i smelled scam all over the place  i said to her so before i showed you the coupon it was 710  after the coupon it was 710  does that sound right to you  with that i took my stuff and went back to my old dry cleaners which is further away but at least are honest about quoting prices  they dont do coupons but i would rather deal with honest people than people who send out coupons with no intentions of giving you a real price break  this is a convenient location since i shop at frys and big lots which is in the same shopping center  if delias had given me a real discount and had done a good job with the cleaning they would have gotten 100 of all my cleaning including quilts and bedspread which i usually dry clean before it gets colder  i just dont like the bait and switch or the maneuvering of pricing to make the public believe they are giving you a deal  everybody loves a deal but nobody likes a scam,0.0

ive been meaning to go here for over a year now and finally last week i made it in and am so glad i didthe restaurant itself has a nice cozy warm atmosphere the menu is what id describe as bistro style with plenty of french influence one of the nicest things though is they offer byow bring your own wine for just 10 corkage only 1 on tuesday i believe i ordered the mussels provenal 11 to start which had some great flavour they also brought us some bread which came with house churned butter that had been accented with honey delicious my wife had the baked eggplant 11 which she enjoyed alsofor the mains she ordered the duck confit 26 and i opted for the bonein veal chop 28 she let me try some of hers also which was fantastic especially the bread pudding but i think the veal was my favourite by a slight edge the parmesan risotto cake and brandy cream peppercorn sauce wowservice was also impeccable not once were our glasses empty with constant attention to the wine and wateri will definitely be returning and highly recommend making a visit one of the gems in south etobicoke,1.0

ordered for pick up and i have to say it was quite pretty darn good got the kilobyte burger byte size spicy poutine and chicken souvlaki for the cost of around 20  pretty cheap considering the size of each dish the burger and souvlaki comes with an abundant amount of toppings and the byte size poutine is huge  in regards to their poutine i got the spicy special that included bell peppers and 2 onion rings on top of an over flowing amount of fries and honestly even though i love spice i would recommend the regular poutine  the bell pepper marinade takes away from the taste of the gravy and cheese which i consider the whole point of getting a poutine it was still very delicious as was everything else but i think it would be even better without the spice addition  for the burger though the bell peppers added a nice kick to an already delicious package as i have stated many times already portions were large i could barely finish the burger and poutine so far my favourite burger joint to date,1.0

im just in shock by my experience here i had been in contact with stephanie who was very sweet and she got me to go in and check out the car we picked out i went in on wednesday and i spoke with mike super nice guy i really liked him i was interested in a 2015 camaro lt we test drove it and crunched some numbers i was approved with no money down or anything but it was just a little out of my price range so i went home to think about it i came back today on halloween and told mike that im ready to look for more cost affective options but still desired a camaro he handed me off to chris who tried selling me a 2013 for almost 200 more it was such a rip off and than he told me he could bring that car down to what the 2015 would be but if i could afford that to begin with why would i get the older model well that was absolutely insulting and instead of him trying to find me a car in my price range knowing what car i wanted and where i wanted to be he was concerned more with the commission hed be losing and made me seem crazy for the price i wanted to be at i work in customer service and that is not how you help your customers you find the best solution for them i will not be coming back here and i will probably buy a mustang instead beware fellow buyers,0.0

if you have never flown on frontier  dont bother  worst experience ive ever had  while yes they do offer a straight through flight from las vegas i regretted this purchase from the second we checked into the airport  if i could give zero stars  i would40 per bagmost uncomfortable seating everno drinks no snacks even water without an up charge incredibly rude stewardesses  beyond belieffirst  each person that got up to use the bathroom was told to go back and sit in their seats i cannot permit you to do that right now is what one stewardess told a young teenager who when asked what are you doing and he replied i have to go to the bathroom  second  a gentleman came rushing into the back of the plane when the same stewardess says  what do you think youre doing the fasten seatbelt sign is still on go sit down the man tried to explain that his son had just gotten sick and thrown up and all he wanted to do was clean him up and buy a ginger ale to settle his stomach  the woman again told the man to return to his seat  that the crew would take care of it when they could  i mean come on  the mans kids just threw up in the cabini dont care how fast or cheap this airline is  you get exactly what you pay for  and i will never fly this airline again,0.0

last on my agenda for restaurant week was fu at the hard rock hotel  lovely to look at outside the red footbridge that leads inside i also found this restaurant to serve colorful and very tasty cantonese food in a relaxed setting  diane and i were seated on a comfortable banquette and a chinesethemed chair behind a black lacquered tablethis was our best bargain of rw because for 3013 the first course for each person included an asian tapas sampler that consisted of a steamed shrimp dumpling with chili aioli pan fried pork potsticker and a spicy wonton the second course a choice of wok seared salmon with ginger basil sauce grilled bbq korean short ribs or honey walnut shrimp with lemon aioli and the third course a dessert trio of chocolate ganache lemongrass gelee with coconut tapioca and lychee mochi ice cream  none of the appetizers or desserts could be ordered in such combinations off the regular menu except to pay for each item separatelythe potsticker was excellent with ginger sauce  i didnt find the wonton to be spicy at all  and i quickly gobbled up the delicious steamed dumpling  since i was very hungry and wanted to thoroughly check this place out plus present a more comprehensive review i also ordered a bowl of spicy chicken hot  sour soup which was nicely hot and spicy as billed with morsels of chicken bamboo shoots wood ear mushrooms green onions and black and glass noodlesa fairly mild but still spicy goodsized serving for one dinerlucky for me diane had a hard rock hotel bogo coupon for fu from the night before when we had become introduced to culinary dropout so besides two entrees of honey walnut shrimp we were also presented with our ordered choice of kung pao chicken  diane got her walnut shrimp devegetablized but i enjoyed the cool cucumber slices that served to offset the warm and large battered shrimps  the lemon aioli on this dish was subtle the shrimps were succulent and the candied walnuts were neatly covered with sesame seeds  this entree was quite large in sizeindeed there is no noticeable portion control in operation here  the kung pao chicken that was plunked before me on a platter was easily enough to serve two even though i ate two entrees by myself  but im a big boy with a big appetite  lol  this was deadahead cantonese kung pao chicken just mildly spicy with slices of red and green bell pepper mostly whole peanuts and no visible chili peppers  the spice emanated from the brown sauce in which the large tender hunks of chicken and other ingredients were bathed  no filler like celery was present and no fat clung to the toptier chickenin the assemblage of desserts the tapioca tasted lemony and the mochi resembled the flavor of vanilla  the chocolate ganache with chocolate rabbit ears on top and cake underneath was fabulous  even the smooth and hot jasmine mist organic tea was great  and refilled ceramic pots just kept on coming for the extensive duration of our dinner  the meal lasted long because i was barely able to finish all of the fine cantonese food laid out before me  but eventually i didthumping music added to the otherwise serene ambiance  and service was friendly and excellent and so accommodating that when i asked for sweet  low although i found out that it is not normally served in the restaurant splenda and equal are a server on his own initiative left the restaurant to get some from room service and quickly returned with a large supply of pink packetsthis was a great way for us to bid goodbye to restaurant week just before we left for california  and we will surely be back for more of the wonderful cantonese food so graciously served at fu,1.0

terrible customer servicein the interest of full disclosure and fairness   i do fancy their biltong  that said a good product does not a good business make  the ownersworkers at this place are complete jerks  walked in a couple of weeks ago and was not greeted by either of the two persons working in a bedroom sized shop  when i asked about purchasing biltong in bulk the woman muttered something about internet pricing being different and when i asked a question attempting to clarify she blurted out its just too difficult to explain  and kept repeating 2299 a pound its 2299 a poundit makes perfect sense because their website is a complete piece of crap that is nearly impossible to navigate as for the cultural insensitivity one reviewer mentionedone neednt consider culture when there exists a lack of basic human decency  i have been in and out of southern africa for 3 decades and never been treated as poorly as i was in by south africans as i was in matthews north carolina  their laughable website alludes to the boers and voortrekkersthey should be in shame for invoking those names as they are an embarrassment to a people with a proud tradition of hospitalitykinda weird how yelp doesnt openly display the very critical reviews of this kak plek shit place  well see if they put this one in reviews not currently recommended,0.0
best vets office i have ever been to the staff are so helpful and caring the hospital is super clean comfortable and private  my little cat well little pudgy eugene had the unfortunate need for their services a few months back while on vacation and shortly after being checked on by some friends eugene decided to jump behind our washing machine where he remained for two days horrible right i still get sick even thinking the little guy was trapped for that long i assumed since he had food and water that he would be fine boy was i wrong learn from me and do not ever have your animals unchecked on for more than a day anyways we return and i find him and he is in horrible shape  after taking him to an er in avondale twice and was so disappointed in their care not to mention costs i found this amazing place they nurtured my little eugene back to health kept close tabs on his condition and kept him medicated well while he heeled the staff were just great and the prices were more than fair i have tons of faith in this great hospital and would refer them to anyone just hope you never have to deal with what eugene and my family had to,1.0

horrible horrible experience do not waste your money my girlfriend and i were stopped on the strip by a guy named luke i believe he was really nice and smooth with his words but dont believe anything they tell you they will tell you that youll receive free drinks and food absolutely no food was provided resulting in me feeling sick because i started slowly drinking on an empty stomach thinking i would be able to eat a meal with my drink first bar we went to we received one drink ticket the bartenders told us we could either get a beer or a well drink so we got 2 pineapple vodkas we were a little over half way done with our drinks and the bartender says they made a mistake and the ticket was only for a beer so we had to pay for our well drinks horrible miscommunication between the bar staff and the world crawl staff we headed to the next bar and there were lots of sugar filled shots laid out for us all which was the only decent thing they provided except half way through people grabbing shots they announce that its only 1 shot per person and anyone seen grabbing more than 1 would be kicked out theyre so cheap they scam thousands of people everyday the least they can do is provide more than 1 shot per person once we moved on to the next spot which was drais everyone split up and did theyre own thingoverall this was a waste of time and money youre better off talking to promoters throughout the strip and getting on guestlists,0.0

what a wonderful find this restaurant has a lot of character and personal laity  both times i went was during lunch and it wasnt that busy but bustling enough to create a wonderful ambience i love the customized approach to fish and chips that off the hook takes i ordered the rainbow trout with cajun batter and cajun fries and jalapeo ranch dipping sauce and vinegritte coleslawwhen it finally arrived it smelt like perfection and it was a concoction of perfectly blended spices well cooked fish with a gorgeous crust that was just ridiculously delicious with a lovely crispy texture the fries were mouth wateringly decadent and spicy as well the dip was the cherry on top as it just accentuated the whole dish to a level of culinary grandeur and the coleslaw worked well to balance the spices with its sweet and mild flavors the only problem was the quantity as it was an ordeal to finish the massive portions served all in all it made for a wonderful dining experience,1.0

not a professional establishment ive never had a chair break on me in a restaurant i realize that im larger than a standard person at 63 and 300lbs but if you serve something titled the big rig geared towards the types you see in a coppola film you should anticipate some above average size people accidents happen as a paramedic supervisor i understand that but a seemingly annoyed manager who does absolutely zero to offer some type of resolve other than a bag of ice or something has earned a permanent lost customer,0.0

the best place in vegas to stay is wynn  everything about the hotel room outdoes anything else on the strip  the down comforters the complimentary slippers the lcd hd screens and the bathroom tv  were my favorite features of my stay  the deli by the sports book makes great sandwiches and salads and the poker room is always run smoothly  next time you book your next trip to sin city makes this your home base,1.0
bmv is not the place to go if you have a specific book in mind it keeps cost down by not keeping a digital database and it is too huge to operate like an old school bookstore where the owner knows every single book instead it is like a well organized library with quality selection and inexpensive prices only complaint it seems that  the science section has been dumbed down by all the new age science books but they still accept used books i believe it is always fun to spend time in this bookstore and i spent a fortune here i hope time would not degenerate this store,0.0

when i wrote my first review of discount tire on e thomas rd i knew it was a stinging review also that it was valid as such i also sent my review to corporate headquarters the same day i recieved a call from ryan the manager of the e thomas rd store  his apology was warm and sincere  there were no buts or explaining away he asked what my main concern was and i told him about the issue with the spare tire he immediately saidbring it in ill look at your spare and if needed replace it free of charge turns out it was a donut tire but looked like it had been used several times it was replaced for free that was more then i expected but am quite pleased   the process was lengthy because the donut had to be ordered and because of my work schedule each time i went in tho i was given superior customer service when i went in to pick up the donut jim helped me and even tho by looking at my invoice he prolly knew who i was he was courteous and treated me like john q customer i appreciated that   i am giving discount tire on e thomas rd 5 stars because my issues were resolved with grace and dignity on both sides intact but more because i felt like my concerns had been heard thank you,0.0

my experience at this establishment was nothing short of horrible this was the 3rd time that i tried it and found that the  costumer care is lacking the first time the staff was rude to my self and my friend the second time i came in for a wax and the receptionist who is the owner told me to go to the room i waited for 10 min  when a staff finally arrived she asked me to leave the room do that she can serve a different client i left after that i then decided to try them one more time today the wax ok though i had to tell the girl that it was to hot but she still continued with out cooling it i finally had to be persistent regarding the hot wax the   pedicure was fine but not worth the money they charge  i then processed to get a full set of powder gel nails when i sat down i told the nail tech exactly what i wanted half way i noticed that my nails where different shapes and length i had to ask her multiple times to file them and fix them she became rude and argumentative with me and sent me to talk to the owner  who  told me to go somewhere else  if you want to be treated like trash then this is the place to go i then drove to zen nails on avenue road and received great service as well as they fixed my horrible looking nails,0.0
look i dont expect a whole lot out of albertsons i get that it is a mega chain and in general i really dont shop there  however i began to buy products from albertsons about a month ago because i became aware that they carried local sustainable shrimp and i wanted to support the cause  however albertons has disappointed me so badly i get the feeling i will be boycotting them for a very long time   i was playing around online one day and came across the website of blue oasis shrimp  much to my surprise blue oasis shrimp is a sustainable shrimp company in las vegas that farms environmentally friendly hormone free shrimp  even more surprising the albertons across the street from my home carried this shrimp  being from san francisco i was really excited that i could actually buy fresh shrimp from the grocery  so the next day i walk across the street to albertons to get my shrimp  first i was dismayed to learn that the shrimp apparently doesnt sell very well and from what i could tell really isnt promoted  one of the workers behind the counter offered that many people cant get past the fact that the heads are still on the shrimp  disappointing but i pledged that my boyfriend and i would be in every week to buy our pound of shrimp note that while we were there we also spent 50 bucks on other groceries money we wouldnt have spent at albertsons otherwise i wrote albertons customer service department to urge them to continue selling this product and was rewarded with an impersonal canned response that had clearly not been written by anyone who had taken the time to read my letter today my boyfriend went in the store to buy our usual order and noticed that the shrimp wasnt on display any longer he asked about the shrimp and was told that because the product doesnt sell the shrimp is now immediately frozen in 5 pound blocks and that they would need to go defrost some  so just to be clear the fresh shrimp that i am buying because it is fresh shrimp that came from down the street is now frozen upon arrival  which defeats the purpose of buying fresh shrimp  even more insulting they continued to charge him the full 1299 price per pound  to compare i believe the shrimp that is frozen deheaded and shipped from thailand is 999 a pound but i am paying 3 dollars more for shrimp that had to be trucked in from 5 miles down the road and then promptly ruined  and i also wonder how albertons expects to sell any shrimp if it is all sitting in a freezer in the back and not displayed in any way at the front counteragain i realize that albertons is a chain and that if their customers arent buying something they may not be particularly worried about little things like supporting local business or environmentally sustainable food  however sustainable shrimp in the desert is such a cool idea and albertons just doesnt appear to support care or respect the product it is lucky enough to carry  i do feel bad for the workers behind the counter who appear genuinely frustrated and agree that this shrimp is the best shrimp they have ever tasted  i will likely search to see if there is another store a different albertons or even better a different business that carries this shrimp and actually sells is fresh as is intended,0.0
came back to redeem my coupons the service is always great when i come here they are always very helpful in explaining their menu and are very quick at making my order everything is made to order so your food will be hot and fresh their menu changing so there arent any more meals except one which i think is worth it its also nice having a hot dog on a stick that isnt in a mall,1.0

second time going there and each time i went there i was disappointed this shop just opened up near my home and i was happy to see something similar to vs barbershop open up near me since i use to drive about 20 minutes to get to one few months later  i decided to stroll in for a haircut lady took me in  it wasnt busy at all  in fact it was empty  i told her i wanted a haircut and she went along cutting my hair which felt like something i can get at fantastics sams or supercuts i didnt feel at  it was a special mens grooming place at all  after my haircut i looked at it a few times and had to correct her on uneven sides and bulk hair leftover i mean cmon  you want us to pay big bucks and i have to correct your hair skills the second visit i figured id give them another shot but im usually that guy that you only get one shot to prove me youre good but since im a nice guy  i thought maybe id just get a shavetrim one lady in there nobody else in there and i have to make an appointment  i mean how long does it take to get a shavetrim  no where in their website says anything about making appointment so what gives you really cant spare another 2030 minutes to do a quick shavetrim people make appointments all the time and they still wait to get seen so even if you were 10 minutes late for your appointment it wouldnt matter you just made the company money and probably an extra tip for taking me in as a walk  in does this place hire dummies or what im not going back here again vs barbershop doesnt disappoint me never has  and they are worth far more better tips then this wannabe place,0.0

i have to give props to the fantastic staff at this hotel they are professional proactive and genuinely care about their guests  everything about our stay exceeded our expectations  except for one rouge guest who thought it would be a great idea to pull the fire alarm in the middle of the night despite the chaos and rightfully angry guests the staff took care of the situation quickly and tactfully i dont think i would have been able to handle the situation as well as they did this could have been one of the worst nights i have ever spent at a hotel but it all turned out well in the end we will definitely stay here again thank you stephanie and the night staff for all your hard work,1.0
i came here with a group of my friends for a going away dinner for one of them my friends were already waiting for me and as i sat down the waiter  anthony was at our table but i dont even think he noticed that i got there because he didnt asked if i wanted a drink or anything he stopped by our table every 20 minutes just to refill the water and barely even talked to us when it came to ordering food i asked if the lamb sliders were good and he said they were his favorite the lamb sliders came out and 50 of it was the bread so i took off the top bun and it was still disgusting the duck fat fries were alright the fries were very hard all in all i have no idea why this place has 4 stars the whole experience was awful and a waste of my money,0.0

i didnt even up buying my rx frames here but i have to take a couple off minuites of my precious lol time to review themi was here this morning sat 0428 to look around for a new first pair of rx frames my islander self loves wearing shorts and flipflops and i usually wear them everytime i go and buy something that i feel like i would get hustled from but today i was such a mess as i havent slept all night sick from pregnancy i looked so raggedy and felt i might get judged too much lol but all three ladies on duty were super duper sweet no judging hustling or anything that made me feel uncomfortable just top notch professionalism and friendliness they didnt have a huge variety as other larger retail stores but they deffinately had a very good collection not many other stores has i immediately fell in love with a pair of gucci i forgot what model unfortunately i didnt end up getting my pair form them i ended up going to lc boca park and found a pair of versace i have a funny right ear so fitting can be tricky for me it literally took me 4 months to finally get my glasses because the last time i looked i was disappointed as i never like what fits my ear properly i really loved the gucci from eyediology i was going to come back for it if i didnt find a perfect fitting one for me but i had to get the other  i knew eyediology didnt carry the brand i wish they did as i really wanted to give them my business since they were awesome not that lc was so bad i did feel a bit uncomfortable as i suspect they were working on commission since i entered the door one attendant over voiced the others greetings and had this energy that im hers a bit more uncomfortable during the transaction too im guessing because of the location anyway thats another review i talk too much lol anyway thank you ladies i wish shopping for anything is as a breeze and soothing as my experience today at eyediology,1.0

tried this for the first time yesterday  my husband and i shared food from the hot table  a beef meatballtype of thing covered in a nice gravy with onions  we chose to enjoy it with two cold salads coleslaw and potato salad  the beef was moist and juicy and the gravy with onions added a nice contrast to the meat  the coleslaw was nice and light  the potato salad was my favourite of the two salads  it tasted really fresh and the potatoes were cooked just rightwe asked for a cherry jam cookie and americano to finish our afternoon snack and the server added an almond sugar cookie to try  the cherry jam cookie was really good  the jam was really tasty and made me wish we had gotten a few more of these  the almond sugar cookie tasted like my motherinlaws christmas cookies which are very good but were even betteri like the fresh decor and the friendly staff  the food tastes fresh and is very well executednice addition to the neighbourhood  i cant wait to go back  id like to try one of their openfaced sandwiches or the brunch next time we go,1.0

the interior of this hotel looks great except for the fact that its under construction and we had to go through best western for hotel access the rooms are spacious and visually its a stunning hotel for their reservation price but let me tell you the story of how horrible this place is and no im not making this upmy friend booked this hotel one year in advance and when she checked to see if it was in the systemno record fine moving on the hotel gave the wrong room arrangement ie incorrect room number not to mention the manager stood my friend twice and did not show up to answer any of her questions did i mention that she was booking a presidential suite for her wedding cue in the important night we booked the room for four people and we were presented with 1 bed you know what perhaps you could have given us an extra bed a presidential suite with 1 bed for 4 people but we can forgive this since they told us its a surcharge per person to add extra beds the day my friend checked in a light bulb was broken and it took them 30 minutes to repair it great now its night time and we asked for more pillows the front desk staff had the nerve to ask us how many pillows we have in our room because they would only send us one one pillowwhat in the world next we had to remind them again that they forgot to send us that one pillow and blanket sheetsin no way am i pointing fingers at only the hotel manager name removed for confidentiality purposes and i am not asking for a compensation just trying to write down my experience and frustrations as a whole its not to say that the hotel didnt have positives and i truly feel that they accommodated us by setting up an earlier breakfast time i really really wanted to enjoy my stay here and the room itself was awesome  great place for a prewedding hang out it was unfortunate what transpired and hopefully no one has to go through this again,0.0

had great expectations for this restaurant and was highly disappointed  arrived early and sat in the lounge  my husband had to go to the bar to get drinks for us since the server was nowhere to be found and never acknowledged our presence  i had a mojito and there was no visible mint in my drink  wth  was seated at our table at the time of our reservation the server told us that we could not order an appetizer first that we must order our entire meal to include wine at one time end of discussion  okay we make our choices and order about 10 minutes later  still no bread  wait about 15 minutes for appetizers they are brought  then finally some bread is brought out  we ordered the bacon wrapped dates and the olives and they were meh  the warm bread was covered in salt so much so that my husband the sodium freak said it was too much for him  i had the shrimp with spaghetti while my spouse had the lamb  my pasta was clumpy and overcooked as were the two shrimp i received with it  my husbands lamb was ordered medium rare and was received as  well done  both appetizers lacked seasoning and we were not offered any  parmesan for the pasta or saltpepper for any of our food  on a side note the portions are incredibly  small  my sister lives in vicenza italy and i thave traveled there on a frequent basis for the past 30 years 34 times a year and this is not italian food or service  the waiter asked how we were enjoying our meal and we told him  no one from management approached us  we did not order dessert because the majority of it appeared dried out  my husband did order coffee for after dinner  this was a total waste of our time and money,0.0

had service with them for almost 3 years  horriblewould have changed but had no reasonable affordable alternative at the time  in the beginning there were no other options at the end there were no other options that did not have a longterm commitment which didnt work for us because we knew we were movingpaid for the fast internetbut it was painfully slowon demand literally never worked  it was horribly frustrating to pay for something we never gotdvr never worked right either  we might get a couple weeks of working right here and there but always it would go back to failure mode  we repeatedly changed boxes both through driving to the office and waiting in line great way to spend a day off by the way or having techs come out to the house  we had problems such as things not recording even when programed to record only half of the show recording erasing recordings for no reasons some boxes would erase  shows even though the box was only 14 full  however the most frustrating part was that our shows would tape often with visual disturbances cant watch or no sound at all as i said we repeatedly drove to the office to exchange boxes had techs come out to change them out too  each person told us a new reason for the difficulties  some would say we were given the wrong kind of box  interestingly they kept changing us back and forth between the same kind of boxeseach person telling us that we should have the other kind of box worked through the phone techs had repeated service callsnothing ever worked  they even ran a new cable line to our house but they were never able to get it working rightcustomer service was horrible  long wait times on the phone only to be treated rudely  one of the techs completely creepedoutscared  my kids and i but for the most part they were decent although ineffectivelooking back we should have closed our account long long agoeven if it meant paying the early termination feeoh i almost forgot to mentionthere were frequent billing errors that were almost impossible to get fixed  never high dollar amounts but enough to add up over the course of a year,0.0

we had an absolutely lovely two night stay at the dunhill the hotel is located right in the middle of all the action so we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go rooms and beds were on the smallish side but the beds were comfortable and the shower was roomy with good water pressure there was a refrigerator stocked with complimentary water and the complimentary breakfast got the job done what really made this a 5 star experience though was the staff everyone was so friendly and helpful take pete for example pete is the resident bartender and socialite extraordinaire 90 of the patrons greeted him with a hug and a kiss not only does pete make a great drink he makes great conversation he also introduced us to several locals who were able to give us insider information on what to check out around town plus he remembered our names and drink preferences its little details like that that make a big impression,1.0
this review is for the wrongfully accused and cabin rooms my friend and i are addicted to escape rooms and naturally we had to check out this place while in vegas i purchased a groupon for wrongfully accused and the process was really easy i was able to book the room the same day i purchase the groupon which i really appreciated since there was another room from another company who refused to do this the room was relatively easy and we were able to escape in 45 minutes we came back the following day to do the cabin and this room was definitely more challenging but we loved itoverall my friend and i really enjoyed our experience at lockdown and the customer service was amazing ,1.0

i stopped by this restaurant to grab a few drinks after a long day at work this restaurant is conveniently located close to the entrance of the grand canal shoppes in the venetian resort the restaurant is unique with it being one of only a few restaurants that offer seating along and prime views of the grand canal inside the resort we decided to sit at the bar i was addressed by the bartender in a way that i did not appreciate and was not politically correct for lack of better words the comment was based on my appearance even after standard business practices like checking a guests id to verify qualifications about someone like age the bartender continued to address me in a way that was obviously not accurate i was very embarrassed by this as i was put in a very awkward and uncomfortable position of deciding whether or not to address it or ignore it i was embarrassed as the company i was with definitely noticed and heard the comments i felt that the intention to incorrectly address me was not malicious but it was definitely ignorant and pretty much ruined my experience here its unfortunate because the cocktails were decent rare and impactful guest issues like this unfortunately leave little opportunity for guest recovery and needless to say i will not be returning nor recommending this restaurant to anyone in the future,0.0

ordered via phone for a lunch pickup the hostess was not the friendliest over the phone but despite that we decided to order the crab cakes and fish tacos i asked for salads for both orders and waited several minutes for the total i was told our food would be ready in 15 minutes i arrived 25 minutes later and was greeted by who i assume to be the manager he accepted my cash payment and proceeded to the back to retrieve my order heres where the lack of customer service becomes noticeably apparent the hostess who i assume took my order returns to the front for at least 5 minutes she did not greet me nor acknowledge me she didnt ask me if i was helped if i wanted to be seatednothing finally a cook who walked up from the back of the house kindly asked if ive been helped and i replied that i was being helped by the gentleman who retreated to the back the hostess however still couldnt be bothered to ask me anything anyway 10 minutes have now passed and the gentleman returns with my order he indicates that the bread isnt ready and i would have to wait 10 more minutes i told him that we would forgo it as i looked through the order i realized that 2 different salad sizes were provided  a very small container of just lettuceseriously and a larger container with tomatoes nuts etc i questioned why the sizes were different it was explained that the salad for the crab cakes was an upcharge i countered by stating i asked for salads as the sides for both meals and each meal comes with a side so they should be same his explanation was deficient as he stated with the crab cakes salad is an upcharge and again i didnt understand why an upcharge larger salad wasnt provided for the tacos additionally when i reviewed my receipt i didnt see an upcharge reflected for this meal furthermore the hostess did not indicate or explain any of this during the call the food was mediocre at best my fish was overcooked and while i asked all condiments to be on the side someone thought it made sense to place sour cream in the container with the hot food of course the salads were horrific mine was just a toddlers handful of lettuce whereas my sisters looked and tasted old she was scared to eat the cheese because it didnt look fresh crab cakes were ok  cold and falling apart but at least edible so it looks like we wont be dining here again because the standard to which we were accustomed to has significantly lowered since our last visit just sad,0.0

this is one of my favorite restaurants in charlotte  i have been here twice when traveling by myself for dinner and they are always welcoming and accommodating  they really have never made a big deal about if i want a table or the bar and leave it up to me to chose  their bread service is the best part of the meal  they serve warm crusty baked french bread with a white bean herb and olive oil dip  it is similar to hummus but way better   the first time at aria i had a seasonal scallop and gnocchi dish which i was sad that they had taken off of the menu this past time but it is great that they change their menu seasonal  this past visit i stuck with a classic  chicken parmigiana  the chicken was lightly pan friend and had fresh mozzarella on top  it is served with pasta sauce and spinach  i loved the addition of spinach into this dish  it was a huge meal two large pieces of chicken and i could only eat one  it would be great to split or great leftover if you arent traveling,1.0

lots of bad reviews on here thought id post my experiencei drive a classic truck do all the work myself  i had an axle seal fail ruining my rear brakes  i took the opportunity to replace everything on the rear myself which should have been no problem  well weeks later after extensive troubleshooting i still couldnt stop the rear brakes from locking up i spent a pretty penny on parts trying to fix this on my own and finally gave up  i took it into one shop that misdiagnosed a proportioning valve issue then couldnt find a replacement part then made me drive it home to make space in their driveway for a car show  i chose another shop that took the wheel off and said it all looks good to me and sent me packingi stopped in to just brakes and described the problem to gene and the guys  they were confident they could fix it but after having it on the rack for awhile gene could tell this wasnt an easy problem  i left it with them and gene spent many hours troubleshooting and diagnosing a very difficult problem that i likely would have never found myself  the fixed the truck and now it is running sweet  given the number of troubleshooting hours they had to put in i was worried about the cost but they gave me a damned reasonable bill basically charging me for a few parts and a minimal amount of labor thanks for getting my truck back on the road guys much appreciated,0.0
i honestly wanted to love this place however the only good thing about this restaurant was the charming ambiance we should have been tipped off by the restaurant being completely empty on a saturday night the food was horrendous possibly the worst restaurant meal i have ever had the salad dressing was literally olive oil and salta lot of salt the grilled peaches tasted like meat as they had clearly been cooked on the same grill the pasta sauce was terrible very bland except for the overwhelming flavour of onions given some of the good reviews on here i sincerely hope they were just having a bad night but i wont be back,0.0
if i had only one day in vegas i would make sure that this is one of my stops  the most visually pleasing malls ive ever been too  unlike any of the other casino malls this one has no shops that you can afford  its all high end  but i come for the wow factor the canals of venice disney clean and the italian square will just blow you away you will get an actual canal with gondoliers and italian singers  you get the feel you are outdoors but in a nice air conditioned comfortable indoor mall  the town square is cool with many street type performers  you may not shop but you will regret not coming here for that reason  from the artwork to the architecture this really is a cant miss place  put it on your must do list,0.0

top notch customer service i am a hilton honors member so i try to take advantage of the rewards program whenever i travel i paid for a nonrefundable reservation and ended up having to change it to a different day i was not able to change my reservation with hilton honors customer service so i called the hotel instead the hotel manager chuck was very accommodating and made the change for me right away without asking any questions then my car broke down on i10 in the middle of nowhere in benson az on a saturday i had to tow my car to tucson to get it fixed under such a stressful circumstance i didnt even know if i could make it to phoenix on the same day or not so i called the hotel again to inform them that i might not be able to stay that night seth was the one who picked up the phone he told me i could call back anytime to cancel my reservation he even called me later to touch base with me to see if my car was fixed finally i made it to the hotel around 10pm seth was there to greet me ms w i spoke with you on the phone im so glad youve made it suddenly i felt right at home my hotel stay was short but wonderful my room was clean and the breakfast was delicious when i requested a late check out at 1pm seth gladly accommodated my request without a charge the customer is indeed god at this hampton inn from several days prior to my arrival to the day i depart this hotel was there every step of the way to provide me the best customer service possible they went above and beyond to ensure i have a wonderful stay which i certainly did id like to thank seth and chuck 5 star all the way,0.0

so pissed after replacing all 4 tires at walter or fail my pa state inspection i only get to use them for 20k miles  thanks alot now i have to replace them again wtf  for the price charged on those tires it should have paid for some human honesty to tell me how crappy the tires that were going to be installed after more research on the tire brand used it seems like he just drove my car to pepboys and used their generic brand and charged me a shit load of money  i am so upset every time i think about my damn tire experienceif this place tells you new tires are needed to pass state inspection just go get them replaced elsewhere and go back to show them the new tires to pass  nobody can afford 4 tires replacement every 20k miles at least i definitely cant afford to pay in this manner,0.0

i got a great deal on groupon for 25 2 ppl for 1 hour of archery upon arrival check in was extremely easy the instructor had us watch a tutorial on safety and how to shot an arrow then we went to a room in the back where he already had our targets bow and arrows set up he did a quick lesson with us and explained the safety procedures once more and then let us shoot on our own while we practiced there were a few locals who were really nice and gave us some tips we were amazed at there super advanced bows and the distance they shot also the instructor was so nice he let us shoot for over a hour after 80 mins my friend and i decided to call it quits i would definitely recommend this place i felt total badass like i was shooting walkers on the walking dead,1.0
if there was one type of food that would best represent the united states of america i would vote for bbq whether youre a kc texas nc or memphis bbq fan the smoke pit is definitely a contender while im not the biggest fan of nc style bbq the smoke pit showcases the different elements of bbq in its entirety i saw all the rave reviews on yelp so i decided to take a trip with my family when we arrived the parking lot was full and there was a line almost to the door as we inched our way up the line we eventually saw the sign that listed what items were already sold out for the day as a result i ordered the three meat bbq combos which consisted of chicken quarters texas brisket and st louis style ribs while my two sides were the mac  cheese and pork baked beans the dining area is a large open room with various tables strewed about after waiting about 1015 mins our food was delivered on cafeteria style trays on top of red butcher paper personally i love it when my bbq is served on butcher paper because it reminds me of the good ole lone star all of the food was awesome because it correctly reflected the different regions of american bbq my only slight gripe was the white sauce on the chicken quarters while the white sauce did compliment the chicken there was a bit too much of it which kind of detracted from the natural taste of the chickenall in all the smoke pit is a must if youre ever down in the charlotteconcord area simplistic to its core the smoke pit proves that the delictable art of barbeque is alive and well at 796 pkwy n,1.0

very nice staff but theres so many hidden charges we went on for one thing and they always made us do additional blood work we took the money to pay for that visit and then had to pay extra for blood samples here and there we didnt have insurance so the prenatal care for us was going to be 355 a month plus extra for ultrasounds and additional lab work we spoke with the manager to explain to us the contract and we said we have to think about it she said that if we take too long we would have to pay extra for another contract compassionate care wheres the compassion anyways we went to another clinic that did accept sunny babies and the prenatal care was 150 a month all included the new doctor told us that some of the blood work done at compassionate care wasnt necessary for example the toxicology test was unnecessary we told him what they were charging and he laughed lol at first i was very happy and compassionate care because the staff was very nice and helpful especially the nurse maria she was great i lost interest in this place once they started with their hidden fees another good thing about this place is they attend you right away my final tip if you dont have insurance and you do decide to go here make sure you ask them exactly how much you have to pay i hope you have a healthy pregnancy and god bless your little one thanks for your time,0.0

another 5 star little spot in pittsburgh my brother found this place on yelp when they came to visit me and we went before the remodel it was a tiny place only seating was outside but it was well worth the cramped quarters i got the lomo filet sandwich and added some chimichuri sauce for a delish finish the sandwich itself was a ton of meat cooked to perfection and the chimichuri was a nice spicyfresh finish a on the sandwich loved the ambiance of the small place too menu written on the chalkboard loud cooks and a friendly guy taking my order i recently went back and found that they were remodeling i didnt know and was disappointed that i didnt get to fulfill my argentinian steakhouse sandwich needs for that day but i went back and love love love what they did with the place they moved right next door into the vacant building that was next to them i think it may have been another restaurant at some point the decorations are adorable very latin americanretro they have expanded their menu to include salads appetizers veggies and other items including breakfast there was already a line at 11 on sunday when they were getting ready to open we were first in line and i couldnt help myself and had to get the carne con pan so steak bread onions red peppers and chimichurri i had the filet again and my partner had the ribeye both were delish and spot on i also ordered some grilled corn which was also spot on cant say enough good things about this place will continue to frequent and hope their business thrives they deserve it,0.0

this is one of my favorite places to stop on my way home ive tried their tacos and burritos both were very good each time ive went in theyve been very friendly the only complaint was my husband ordered nachos and the sauce was so hot it was almost inedible might just be the way they make things but he didnt ask for any salsa on them otherwise all my experiences here have been wonderful,1.0

as someone who knows the middle east and especially lebanon i find the meals in this establishment to be as near as i can possible think to beirut cooking and dining the ingredients are fresh healthy and plentiful the bread baked there and the dishes have the perfect delicate flavors you can only expect to get in the country i go there to eat often since i sit and take myself back to beirut and to the beautiful country please try the place i personally recommend it which is something that i would never do otherwise the family run place and the wonderful atmosphere always finds its way to your appetite through the wonderful intro to zaatar as a taste introduction to the flavors dipping pita bread in the olive oil infused with zaatar spices is indeed a heavenly experience i know i am going overboard but please do go try for your self and see what i mean this is again form someone who lived and tried all of the meals served there again with a family running the place and a lebanese chef in the kitchen who comes with beirut experience you cant go wrong eating there is like sitting on the kornish in beirut enjoy,1.0

ive given this place too many chances and i officially am no longer a customer they took away the ability to use your card online you can order online but they only accept cash when they deliver no checks i never have cash and shouldnt have to scramble this is 2017 not 1990 last weekend i called at 8pm to place an order and was immediately put on hold i waited the background noise was ridiculous when talking to the order taker and if they are going to force people to call in who use debit or credit cards then at least have a decent quiet spot for people to answer the phone i placed my order of 2 salads and a cheese pizza the girl said it would be here within the hour okay fine its late so whats an hourso we waited and waited and waited finally at 930 i called and the driver answered the phone and told me he had been trying to call me but i wouldnt answer my phone and that the address i gave didnt exist okayso he repeated back to me what the girl wrote down and she had my phone number and street name wrongi shouldnt have to think to ask them to verify the address and number she wrote down because any other pizza delivery allows you to order and pay online so if i make a mistake then thats on me the manager got on the phone and said hed make a new pizza and have it deliveredfinally 2 hours and 15 minutes later our food camehere is where i feel horriblei feel horrible for the employees who work for the irresponsible owner of this establishment because they take the brunt of peoples frustration i feel horrible because the poor kid who delivered my pizza got no tip because the manager said it was on the house yes that was nice but now there was no slip to sign and i had no cash to hand this kid he said he didnt need the tip and i apologized profusely to him i told him to please tell his management staff to send the message to allow folks to pay online if the driver sees this contact me please because i owe you a tipim not a fan of the pizza here in az because we had many great ny style pizza places in fl but i did like the taste of genos pizza and their salads are really good but it doesnt make up for the frustration  i dont even have the energy to type everything that happened the time before but bless the driver again for having patience while he sat at my door for 10 minutes trying to help me pay with my card over the phone since they refuse checks no more bye genos i am breaking up with you for the last time i dont like yoyo relationships please improve for the sake of your customers who keep your lights on,0.0

exactly the kind of bike shop you dream of and so rarely find  go and enjoy extremely nice very friendly and happy staff very competitive prices cheapest quote i got for a major service quick turnaround quoted time was a quick turnaround and they finished even earlier and called to tell me it was ready for pickup very capable mechanics they do complicated services like fork work inhouse honest and gracious they taught me how to disassemble my full suspension bike for travelas a free courtesy  and theyd never met me before a quick piece of work but one that would have taken me ages on my own and might have resulted in damaging my bike they like bikes and ride happy to schmooze about trails bikes and life high end equipment shop lowend shops often fail to do good work on highend equipment due to lack of care or unfamiliarity with it highend shops do great work on high endequipment and that extends to lowend equipmentworth a drive across town  the kind of place you patronize with a smile  great service great price  highly recommended  ive been patronizing bike shops for almost 20 years and have only found one other shop in this league,1.0
aweful experience the sales people stretch the truth lie and advertise cars falsely be careful going in if you find one on the internet we went in with the vin  and they showed us a car with more accessories on it than was on the same car on the internet and shrugged it off spent three hours there and the salesperson asked me my name over 5 times and wouldnt listen to what i wanted went to another dealership and got a better car cheaper more options and the guy asked me my name once  over all i dont feel they listen to their customers and ill never shop there again terrible experience,0.0

i am so sorry to say that we had a terrible meal and service at the pines tavern last night  we sat at the bar and its hard to imagine bad service at the bar but this server basically disappeared and only after we asked for some attention from one of the other servers did this woman reappear   the meal was described as perch over potatoes and warm brussels sprout salad with a swiss chard pesto  this brownish green covered fishnot perch appeared and sat over cold hard unseasoned fingerlings with black spots throughout and tasteless mushy brussels sprouts  the most disturbing thing was the color of the pesto in no way did it look like food it was truly gross  since our waitress never checked on us i just picked at it but it was not edible  the pines always has had an overly ambitious menu they need to stick to basics and try to master simple fresh food  its so disappointing because its a convenient location,0.0

i love the cozy feel of roaring fork but whats even better than the atmosphere is their incredible happy hour menu i think they have one of the best happy hours in town especially when they start their allnight happy hour during the summer months thats right i said all night happy hour their happy hour menu includes their signatures items including the pork stew fish tacos and the big ass burgerand yes friends its truly a big ass burger keep an eye on their updates because a little birdie told me that the all night happy hour is coming to town very soon,1.0
to be honest i used to live off the best menu item which was the juicy portabella mushroom burger i would pick it up for lunch at least 3x per week in addition to going there for dinnera total addiction until they took it off the menu thats ok i needed a change i love the thai lettuce wraps with peanut dressing thats another serious addiction the sweet hawaiian salad tastes like candy all of the salads are among the best salads you can get anywhere the chicken marsala is fantastic the simple four cheese pasta is crack oh the salmon rice dish with a light lemon sauce will fill you up yet youll feel good those suggested pasta dishes are really good steak and ribs was ok yet i order that at a stake house fish and chips yummy burgers are fantastic the size of the burrito reminds you of your first born child so again ill admit when i lived down the street at the biltmore estates i went here for dinner at least 4x per week at my sons request but its always nice and quiet easy to have great conversations  consistent quality food tons of variety to satisfy everyones  tastes esp great when you dont feel like doing dishes the appetizers are all very good as well,1.0

we ordered the lamb shawarma plates for a mere 895 each tonight for takeout after my brother recommended this place  the man on the phone who i am guessing was the owner was so kind  good start  the food was ready when my husband picked it up  he also ordered a rice pudding to go and the owner was worried that moving the pudding to a takeout dish would ruin the presentation so he let my husband take the pudding in the glass dish it was in asking us to bring it back some time  this kind of friendly service is nearly extinct  our shawarma plates were delicious with tender lamb fresh salad moist rice and a surprise garnish of cucumber yogurt sauce  additionally it came with a generous side of hummus and pita which we were actually too full to eat until later  the owner threw in two ice cold cans of pepsi as well for no extra charge  it is a bit of a drive for us but i think we will make this a regular takeout treat because the food service and prices are simply outstanding  ps  i am from southeastern mi originally and this quality and value made me feel like i was in dearborn again where this type of food has much competition and is always delicious and cheap  this was the highlight of our weekend,1.0
delicious comfort food and the best customer servicethe owners of this restaurant are some of the most genuine humble and sweetest people ive met in my life they welcomed my husband and i the moment we arrived and we quickly had a great wholesome conversation its hard to come by genuine people like this nowadays were new to the area and they truly made us feel like we were familymy husband grew up in the detroit suburbs and is a proud michigander so anything that represents or has some detroit elements to it makes him happy i came across this restaurant was surprised at the name and knew we had to check it outfood  great comfort food definitely true to detroit flavors my husband had the ribs and coney dog and loved it  he felt like he was back homecustomer service  amazing like i mentioned its a family owned restaurant led by a husband and wife team and theyre so sweet and friendlyinterior  humble little fast food restaurant what really matters is the food and customer service and those two are on parnothing like a sweet family owned restauranttheres a lot of heart in this business and we appreciate it so much we loved our experience and will definitely be back,1.0
for a place that specializes in seafood the food was terrible we had the seafood platter for two and everything was over cooked the mussels lobster crab shrimp all over done and dry the calamari was nonexistent we basically were given fried batter we also ordered oysters and they were bland when the oysters were initially brought to us no condiments were given only lemon if you are that confident in your oyster quality why the heck do they suck for the prices this place was charging you would expect better quality i do not recommend this place if you are looking for good seafood,0.0

been here a number of times now and one word to describe nori sushi is wonderful this is my new favorite sushi place in phoenix  stumbled upon it a few months ago and been back frequently  the toro melts in your mouth so good  ive tried 3 or 4 of their specialty rolls and my absolute favorite is the sakana trio roll  it is mouthwatering and has soft citrus filled boba on top  so unique  could tell the fish was fresh and top quality from the first bite  quality has been superb every time  everything is good from the fish to the service to the cleanliness to the location to the patio and the desserts  i dont drink sake but i saw they have a huge selection too thank you nori for bringing yummy sushi to our neighborhood  always pleasant,1.0
i kept seeing pictures of their waffle cones on instagram and after going bang bang definitely lived up to the hype definitely a 55 for the atmosphere of the store quality of the dessert and service the waffle is just like any regular waffle you can get anywhere however with the combination of their icecream it was fantastic the best part about eating the waffle cone is at the end when youre pretty much done with the icecream and wishing you had more but then realizing that the waffle has been soaking up the melting icecreamtheir london fog icecream is probably one of the best icecreams ive ever had the totaro taro was good too but ive had good taro flavoured icecream at other places before i hear their avocado flavour is another great one to get so ill probably try it next time i go  the service was great but a little slow there was only one customer in front of us so we didnt have to wait too long but i can see the waiting times increasing exponentially when there are more people the server was super nice to us and split our waffle cone into two servings we didnt know that this was an option until we heard the girls in front of us getting it essentially they cut the waffle into two and put each piece into a little cup you have the choice of putting one full scoop of icecream in each cup or two half scoops of each flavour this is great for sharing with your friends or when first trying out their flavours,1.0

hidden costs  i was exhausted after the plane trip and knew theyd put a hold on my account for more than the rental but i didnt see the total until the hold came off my credit card  i was wondering whyhow the charge got up so much from a rate of 18 a day for four days it was up nearly 100 dollars and i didnt purchase insurance  hey hertz why you gotta hert people with junk fees  watch out for daily facilities fees  why why do i have a facility fee of 600 a day  the car wasnt in your facility while i was renting itso why am i paying this i purchased a full tank in advance dont do this the clerk told me their gas was less expensive so i fell for it the car had a 10 gallon tank i found gas for 255 hertz hert me with a 3 charge per gallon looked at my receipt picture for all the other confusing charges concession fee recovery hertz operatingmaintenance fee receiving  energy fee  really and tax  1530 dont know if the tax is coming from the state or what but omg  so hertz why not just call it what it is if you want to charge me to cover so much overhead go ahead just dont lie about it  dont tell people you have a great rate like you did me at 18 a day when after everything the rates really going to be closer to 30 a day  thats not counting the huge tax assessment or the tank of gas i over paid for i might have been fine with this cost 30 isnt a bad rate but its upsetting to feel like youve been lied to about what you were paying it feels crappy to find out at the rental desk when youre there to pick up a rental car that theres going to stupid petty little charges like facility and energy and maintenance    be more transparent,0.0
my favorite restaurant in calgary and maybe in the world the service is always excellent menu adventurous i fell in love with this restaurant when i tried their lobster cappuccino at a wine and food tasting years ago i have been back for many different occasions you can taste the fresh ingredients and the sophistication of this world ranked restaurant only if i could afford to go there all the time  ,1.0
one star because i cant give zero  or maybe a star for the server  after her initial bitchiness i got the feeling that she felt sorry for my hungry ass  why  because it took about an hour for me to get my food  and when it came it wasnt worth the wait  heres the deal  i walked in alone and asked to be seated outside the restaurant was crowded and the music really loud   when i sat down a seemingly nice server came over took my drink order hot green tea and brought it over pretty quickly  i had already decided what to have  im a creature of habit when it comes to sushi so i placed the order sat back and relaxed to enjoy reading my book  about 15 minutes later the server comes over to say that the sushi bar is slammed and that it will take 30 more minutes for my food to prepared  when i communicated to her that i wasnt really happy about this she told me that shed understand if i left  but where am i going  by the time i get up and walk over to another restaurant wait for a table and be served it would take longer so i decide to stay   what a mistake  after half an hour comes and goes i turn around to look inside and theres nobody sitting at the sushi bar  i was pissed  why am i waiting  apparently there were two large tables that ordered a lot of food but wtf  im one person who only ordered a few pieces of sushi for gods sake  i finally say to the girl   hey  can they at least send me a portion of my order  so she comes back with half the order and about 10 minutes later the rest   i take a bite and am gobsmacked to find the rice practically crunchy  it was actually hard   so i picked away most of the rice ate the fish and asked for the check  a manager came over and offered me a drink coupon for my next visit  did she not notice that i was drinking tea   i told her that i dont live in the area and asked that she take something off the bill  which she did  but nothing would inspire me to go to this restaurant again  i mean really  its a large place that seats tons of people  youd think that theyd be prepared to feed the amount of people who occupy the place in a somewhat timely manner  while it was crowded it wasnt like there was a wait out the door and every seat filled  talk about poor management  find your sushi elsewhere in scottsdale,0.0

i really liked this guy  i brought my 9 year old stepson in for a new prescription and both he and his office assistant were very personable knowledgeable and fastbeing in a walmart really concerns me  so much that i refuse to eat at the subway or mcdonalds that is in a walmart but dr roter is the exception to the rule  he was very thorough with my stepson and took the time to talk to him and explain everything that he was doingmy vision is fine but if i ever need an optometrist i am coming here and will definitely return with the kid  safe bet for good swift service,1.0
so this is an official checkin and update to my original review the pv location is a different vibe from the others and a lot of the clientele seem to be folks who are now parents but still want to feel like they have a social life i get it having said that those that are seeking a kidlite atmosphere might be happiest here on sunday afternoons when the kidadult ratio is a little lower on our third visit we found that sunday afternoon is our sweet spot id like to give props to our server gage who was awesome he was very knowledgeable about the menu and was able to make great recommendations he was also genuinely friendly attentive and on tops of things that food was great and the beer was cold couldnt ask for a better experience,1.0

came out here to celebrate my birthday like everyone else in the world lol this time around i wanted to stay in the center of the strip instead of circus circus very cheap hotel i was so happy with my whole experience and decision to stay here and for many reasons whyi was able to check in very early around 1pm with no early fee added and most places wont let you do that without adding a fee on top of my checking in experience the front desk agent noticed on my id that my birthday was just around the corner and she suprisingly upgraded my room to a suite im talking about the second to top level on the mardi gras tower and ive never stepped foot into any suite since coming to vegas so this was such an unbelievable treat added to my mini vacationharrahs was already hitting the right notes with me and i felt nothing could go wrongi liked the fact they got a decent food court in the hotel and its also next to other restaurants and a walgreens so i can save a little bit more when lady luck is not on my sideoverall this hotelcasino is definitely worth checking out especially if you dont have a car to drive up and down the strip because this hotel is connected to a monorail that makes stops all the way north and south of the strip i cant think of any other place to stay at after the type of treatment and experience i had i honestly am ready to book another trip to stay here in the next few months hopefully this time i can actually come out winning from the tables lol,1.0

arizona catering was our caterer of choice for our reception at portico weddings  portico recommends we use one of their two caterers but it isnt mandatory  we tried both of them and arizona catering won us over with their hospitable tasting event right at portico and individual conversations with couples who were there sampling the menu  i loved the tasting nights everything we tried was fantasticwe ended up with the same spinach strawberry poppyseed salad that heather described in her review and i concur that it was phenomenal  we had rosemary chicken that was so tender it could have been cut with a spoon  the garlic mashed potatoes and hawaiian sweet rolls topped it all off  it was so good i wish i hadnt been such a nervous bride unable to eat much  everyone i talked to commented on how good the food was and i heard several times it was the best wedding food some had ever had  i have zero frame of reference on that but it was awesome  the servers kept things moving and were very friendly  they cut and served our cake and got the tables cleared in a timely manner  im so happy with the whole thing and really glad we chose arizona catering,1.0

if i could leave no stars i would i went to pravda with a girl friend on friday around 1030 there was a line up which we got in and started to queue as we inched closer to the front we over heard the bouncer with a sad man bun say that he could not let anyone in until 25 ppl leave the venue understandable for safety reasons and as my friend and i were next in line he continued to say we could not go in yet yet 2 girls who jumped the line and chatted the bouncer up saying they didnt have reservations but would love to go in  he let them in when it was my friend and i who should have been next we continue to wait for an hour another lady comes to the front of the line from the side and chatted up the bouncer explaining that the wait was long but she really wanted to try the place he also let her and her friends in when we called him out on it he said it was his childhood friend first of all that is irrelevant had it been true because we were still next in line and there would have still been a safety hazard 25 ppl oversecondly we overheard their entire conversation and know that she did not know him before then interestingly all the ladies who were let in were all caucasian my friend and i were ethnic minorities and im not racially sensitive as we live in toronto for god sakes but never had i experienced such rude behaviour at any establishment even worse clubs when my friend expressed her issue and asked why other were let in who clearly jumped the line the man bun bouncer said i dont tell you how to do your job so dont tell me how to do mine obviously i decided not to give my money to pravda and had a wonderful evening elsewhere will definitely never go back there,0.0

ill start by saying that ive flown allegiant about 10 times and have never had any significant delays or cancelations on any of those flightsthat being said everyone else i know whos flown allegiant has horror stories of sitting in airports if youre lucky for 8 hours only to have the flight cancelled  the phone line is a joke under an hour wait is unheardof and many times youll be hung up on by the system  the app is worse than facebook on androidi actually just took a friend to catch a flight at phoenixmesa airport and the ticket people told us that the flight was cancelled delayed and on time 3 seperate ticket employees standing within ten feet of each other all 3 at the same time  nobody seems to know anything and they definitely arent going to refund you or make you feel like you have any other option then to suck itheres the deal  allegiant books more flights than they can keep planes in the air and in functioning condition  thats the simple fact why your plane was delayed for no apparent reason  they had a plane for your flight lets assume and it didnt pass inspection  that means they have to reroute another plane to come pick you up  that plane could be fairly close pass inspection itself and you might get delayed an hour or two  on several occasions however things dont go quite so smooth  the plane has to come from far away and its already full of other people it doesnt pass inspection either and any number of issues  this means your flight could be delayed 8 hours and at some point the flight crew that was gonna fly you to wherever is going home and theres nobody left to fly flight cancelledyou need to do a costbenefit analysis that takes into account the risks of flying airlines like this  if you need to be there on time fly a more reputable airline and pay the extra    if you have the time and money to waste at the airport bar  gril fly allegiant and accept the fate that chance deals you  i suggest driving theres a lot to see and experience  around this country and you get to keep your belt and shoes on  additionally youll most likely have to smell less of other peoples farts,0.0

wow im very impressed by the food from this truck im usually not overly impressed with food truck food the portions are usually a little small for the price and the food usually isnt amazing this is not the case for burgh bites though i got the rastafarian and was blown away by the amount of flavor in the wrap the jerk chicken had a great flavor and was cooked perfect they used chicken thighs which really helped the corn mango salsa was perfect as well and the pepper aioli had a nice kick and added a nice creaminess to the sandwich the price wasnt bad and the wrap was big and filled me up it also came with a few of their homemade tortilla chips which very different good different though and a pickle which also tasted homemade the other dishes i saw from people looked delicious as well i highly recommend this place,1.0
if i could give them no stars i would i bought their groupon and called them several times to schedule an appointment they never returned my calls then when i finally got an appointment scheduled they cancelled it the day of only two hours before the appointment time the only day that they could do it was the day before we were moving out of state they came did the car i tipped him 20 and then i never looked inside until after my car got shipped to wa when i saw the job he did i was furious it was disgusting the interior that he had wiped down had soap scum he hadnt moved any of the seats to clean around them or under them and the cup holders were filthy we had just bought this vehicle from someone off cl which is why i wanted it detailed in the first place when i called the owner to ask for a partial refund he was curt and said that we should have inspected it and he wasnt responsible i told him that i thought that it was ridiculous that he as a professional detailer and business owner should have to be told how to do their job he said that i was just bitching over dirty cup holders and insinuated that i was just being cheap long story short the job was terrible and the customer service was even worse luckily groupon refunded my account for it i have a feeling though that karma is going to hurt this company save your time and money and do not use this company they have an f rating with the bbb and their own website has typos on it wish i would have done my research first,0.0

im not sure if im lucky or if its super dangerous but mastrionis is a few blocks from our new house and after seeing it on yelp weve been anxious to try it out decided to go on a whim for my mothers birthday after she asked for hole in the wall italian well theres nothing hole in the wall about mastrionis its a classy little joint in a nondescript strip mall on hualapai we have a two year old which is the main reason we havent been here sooner since its not really a kidfriendly spot  but i figured a wednesday night would probably be slow and safe not so much by 7 oclock this place was jam packed thankfully the little criminal behaved wonderfully and we got to enjoy one of the better italian dinners weve had in a long time we had calamari and crab cakes for appetizers calamari was good but the crab cakes were excellent mom had the bone in ribeye hubs had the seafood linguine and i had linguine and clams this is your tried and true italian better than probably any other ive had in vegas and would rival any of my favorite spots in california id say its more like  but they are very generous with the portionsseafood dessert was excellent as well and service was on point we will definitely be back and will probably become our new date night spot,1.0

one of the gems in the city it would make my top 10 places to visit in torontoeveryday they have a beautiful and great garden centre that is open we buy our heirloom tomatoes there every springsummer they also have a good variety of succulents and pots at xmas they have a huge variety of xmas trees but ive never bought one there they arent cheap and i havent graduated to a real tree yet probably next yearon the weekend they have a very large farmers market the saturday one is bigger and the different days have different vendors if you are there on a saturday i recommend the breakfast crepe from the food court its a staple for us on any visit to the farmers market another staple is starting the visit at cafe belong inside for coffee and either one of there delicious biscuits or one of the other baked goods you wont want to miss theseif you wonder around or attend some of the ticketed events they hold cask days food truck awards etc youll eventually find some old brick ovens in that same area is where theyve had the winter village as well they also make a little skating loop right beside it though one of the best parts about brickworks is the back where the old quarry was that is converted into a park with ponds filled with turtles and fish and pathways you can stroll around onthe only downfall to this place is you have to pay to park and if you come for the farmers market around 10am forget about finding a spot come earlier or later though if you are coming from the east side you can easily bike there now though watch out for the scary hill on pottery rd ,1.0
happy to see a new restaurant open up in the neighbourhood it is much bigger than what i thought and great for families or large groups i loved the decor and my fianc appreciated that he could ignore me to watch the blue jays on one of the multiple screens in the restaurant we ordereda caprese salad calamari and pizza rolls to start all were delicious in particular the shrimp and calamari were perfectly cooked and were not overly battered the pizza via mercanti  double decker was delicious the service was fantastic from start to finish we will definitely be back,1.0

i loved this place the music was awesome man that dj was good the crowd was moving and the staff was the friendliest ive encountered in las vegas we reserved a table here for saturday night and couldnt have asked for a better time i made my reservation via freevegaspassescom the club was crowded but there was still enough space to dance i mean it looked like everyone was having a good time the decor is sexy and slick unfortunately we had to leave a little early  because our friend had too much to drink but even when they were kicking us out their staff was gracious and apologetic definitely not the typical bouncer attitude in vegas if youre looking for an ultra lounge where you can dance the night away the cathouse is the place to go,0.0

we visited this place during our family trip to las vegas after a long day we were very hungry and were looking forward to eating good indian food  the place had almost closed for an event next day but the owner was very accommodating   he agreed to provide togo food as most servers had left  the place has simple ambiance friendly staff and good quality food  we ordered vegetarian dishes and they were tasty  one of them had excess oil but it could be due to last minute rush in the kitchen as the other dish mixed veg was good this place has unique desserts and are worth tryingwith unique name good service and tasty food i expect  this business will be one of the most popular indian restaurants in las vegas and recommend it,1.0
terrible experience it literally took our server 15 minutes to greet us there was only 3 tables sat so no excuse after she said she would give us a minute to look over the menu she took an additional 15 minutes to come back they brought our food out at completely different times so my wife got her meal first 10 minutes before i got mine they forgot to ring in one of our orders so it didnt come out at all they gave me a rare burger when i asked for well done i will never go back oh and it was our anniversary so it totally ruined our lunch date,0.0

i had breakfast at the chompies at the mercado del rancho center and it pains me to write that this breakfast stands out as the worst breakfast i have ever had ever if you think about it you really have to go out of your way to screw up breakfast but they managedwe knew we were off to a bad start when we stood at the entrance for about 5 minutes please wait to be seated for someone to seat us in a 12 empty dining room the waiter was attentive so no problems there the problems started when the food arrived 3 of us had menu variations of cornbeef hash and poached eggs the cornbeef had the look and texture of road kill and the eggs were hard boiled 2 of us requested that the eggs be redone but only one of us received it after assurances from the wait staff that it was on its way the food was also more or less room temp when it arrivedto be fair there are a lot of chompies and maybe this was a bad day at a singe location the menu is extensive and i did see other customers orders that looked more appetizing it would appear that they have good food but the execution was the problem we might try it again and order something different,0.0
bottom line tech geeks wet dream ftw this place has the best components at the best prices though their customer loyalty program is laughably badthis is the only store i go to for computer equipment simply because it has the best selection of quality components at the best prices i have no idea why theyve moved 4 or 5 times in the past 10 years within the same 1block radius but its current location has been their largestwhile the store can be a bit intimidating if youre a tech n00b i think their customer service has really improved over the years so that you actually get good advice if all you want is a new laptop at the very least the staff have way better knowledge than staff from the big box stores but for those who enjoy building their own system be it a gaming station home computer or a home media centre you will have access to quality components hdds cables network storages cases and enclosures etc ive stopped by on a few occasions to discuss potential setups and the staff have always made some great recommendations perhaps of more comedic value than anything else is their customer loyalty program whereby you can collect points to purchase shitty prizes like water bottles toy robots and garish clocks time warped from the 80s its like getting first dibs to the garbage dump from the comfort of your own home cant wait to redeem my water bottle after spending 200 on computer parts  it will be mine w00t,1.0

my daughter took me here for mothers day and we were both disappointed as it was our first time here  when we walked in there were a few people waiting so we checked in with hostess she asked how many and said it will be 15 minutes  and i said do you need our name  she said no  i have it under control  about 15 minutes later  she comes out to the lobby and asks us if were next  how the hell do we know thats your job  we didnt actually say that  but thinking it ok so once we were seated we literally waited 10 min before someone took our drink order   i ordered the asiago peppercorn sirloin which looked delicious on the photo when it came out  you could see the cheese slices on the meat they werent even melted the whole experience was very disappointing we wont be going back,0.0
was totally dissapointed in this spa  i went in for a 75 minute massage which ended up being about 60 minutes as she apparently took the 15 minutes she tried to upgrade me on product into the total time slot  i did fall for the coconut oil which sounded great as my skin is really sensitive and i though this would help  i think any normal person would expect a small upgrade in oil to run maybe 510 bucks at most but nope  it was 20  are you kidding me  i realized this at the counter of course because she failed to mention that  stupid me for not recognizing a scammer and asking ahead of time  the massage was just ok  nothing amazing  this place is definitely overpiced  i would rather head to a resort and take the amenities that actually come along with the higher price  like a comfy robe a locker a sauna pool etc,1.0
customer service is key first time going to gen korean bbq house and was recommended by my brother i was under the impression kids age 510 was 10 but i was surprised when they measured my son to see if he was going to be full price they said its new so right off the bat got a little upset because my 8 year old son who is now paying full price hardly eats as much as an adult not their fault but i wish kids price was still in effect barely no wait time on a saturday so with a doubtful attitude we began to order terry our server definitely changed the night always checking our drinks were filled and recommending what to try at no time did we feel rushed to eat and leave like many all you can eat restaurants the manager stood out to me as well because he was constantly walking around and even picked up some plates at our table what what manager does that nowadays overall 5 stars and will be a great spot to try for those who have not,1.0

we went in a small group  two families with 3 kids on thanksgiving monday place was less than busy for lunch and that made our 40 minute wait for food completely unexplainable the waitress was incredibly rude and indifferent after 30 minutes of waiting with all the kids crying for their food we asked how much longer it would take and she shrugged indifferently it took ten more minutes to get our order one fish and chips three sandwiches two kiddie grilled cheese sandwiches and one kids chicken fingers hardly gourmet fare that takes a while to cook at no point during this time did anyone ask us how we are doing or whether we want anything my fish and chips was burned on the outside and raw inside left it after two bites my sons chicken fingers at 10 a childs meal were three frozen shaped pieces of chicken that is sold for 299 a box in every supermarket freezer and a bunch of soggy fries absolutely appalling he is not a big eater but after he gulped down that pitiful portion he asked where is the rest i had to feed him again when we got home to top it all off we had to wait another 20 minutes for our bill until another server took pity on us and produced it absolutely the worst dining experience in oakvile ever maybe if all you want is beer on a friday night this is a decent place but i would suggest to any family to go nearby burloak and try one of the restaurants there  you will eat better and spend less,0.0

in a word amazing the food was fantastic service was on point without hovering the menu selection was incredible with lots of what you would expect for italian but with a unique twist of an unexpected flavor every item was perfection a little disappointed by the small wine selection we friend a lot of different items and the price was very good for the strip will go back again and will definitely treat friends when they come in town to visit,1.0
the service was fine until we showed our waitress the groupon after that we waited a half an hour after we finished our meal before we got any attention we had planned on ordering a dessert but ran out of time the pesto pasta was decent the risotto was watery and had very little flavor i would not return at full price if you purchase the groupon make sure to hide it until the last moment i am a frequent grouponer and this was unfortunately one of the very few less than satisfactory experiences i have had,0.0

bad i had to take my car to get fixed and my new puppy needed food so i called clean air cab to take me to pet co i was quoted 25 minutes maximum and 30 minutes later i called back to see where my can was because it hadnt arrived nor did i get a call with an eta the person i spoke with said they would have the driver contact me i called back again because i hadnt recieved a call the girl on the phone told me the driver tried to call and since i didnt answer he left i had no missed calls and when i asked them to verify my number to see if my contact information was correct it was all right hmm so i asked another cab to be sent out and got quoted another 30 minutes this is not the first time this has happened either i only use clean air because theyre cheap but if you need to be somewhere on time stick to discount cab theyre pretty realiable and the fare is decent youll save yourself a lot of hassle,0.0
maybe other sam woo bbq restaurants are better but we just had a terrible experience at the one in vegas last night  we ordered the 2 item combo that had roasted duck and roasted pork 3 flavor chow mein and chinese broccoli  the chow mein and broccoli came out pretty quick but then we waited for 15 min or longer but the duck and pork still had not arrived  we saw another table get a big plate of duck too  wtf  we finally asked our waiter where our duck and pork is and he said oh were out of duck and pork  im sorry i forgot to tell you  are you fucking kidding me  you forgot to tell us  then my friend asked do you have duck  the guy said no but then when we asked again he said that they have duck  omg  we got the plate which is 920 for 2 pieces of duck  theres 3 size servings for duck  whole half and plate  when we got the bill they charged us 1495 for the 2 pieces of duck  we didnt really question it at first and the paid  as we walked out i said fuck that theres not way that duck was 1495 and i went back inside to look  the menu  they never took off the charge of the 2 item of duck and pork that we never got  they gave us the 625 that was due back to us  yeah not going back here again  always scrutinize the bill when eating out and dont be afraid of questioning the bill if you see something wrong,0.0

congratulations dave and payton  delivering a concept scottsdale has been thirsting for pun intended  we were there yesterday for lunch during the unexpected downpour and the place was packed everyone inside avoiding the rain and the vibe was great  i can imagine how wonderful it is going to be sitting outside on a warm evening  ill be back for that  we ordered the fries homemade pretzel a regular beer brat with sauerkraut and the spicy brat  the homemade pretzel is a standout  perfectly cooked  a yummy cloud of floury heaven with a chewy crust and the perfect amount of salt on top  a very simple item but almost impossible to prepare perfectly and the brat haus did it i paired it with the nonalcoholic ginger beer which is a must try  both the brats were great served on a really fresh bun and presented on a cool tray with a small side of paytons pickled cauliflower lots of sauces available on the table which up the fun factor  curry ketchup anyone  the fries werent as hot as i would have liked but chalk that up to an incredibly busy kitchen trying to keep up with the demand on the opening week    my only complaint the flavors are so yummy and seductive i wanted more   more please  and next time with the nutella milkshake spiked with a dram of whiskey     thanks brat haus for delivering a fun and flavorful alternative to the ohso boring wine bars,1.0
found about this place while looking for mothers day deals and saw they were giving away a lemonade with purchase i convinced one of my kids to go with me since the store would be closing soon and i wanted to try out this place especially after reading the yelp reviews plus im a sucker for deals  with just five minutes until closing time i ordered and the staff was so nice and friendly after getting my order i can understand why it might be called wow wow hawaiian lemonade especially since it was my first time trying an acai bowl and i picked the haupia bowl my first acai bowl and now im hooked  the fruit was really fresh and the frozen acai base combined with everything else just made it a delicious treat the portions are so large that i saved half the next day since the rest of my family didnt want to share and it was just as good the next day i also got the strawberry pineapple lemonade but planning on trying more flavors of both the lemonade and the bowls in the future,1.0

this place is so reminiscent of a new york joint that i was having deja vu the brick wall and the narrowness of the bar make me feel like im in a nice bar in brooklyn there is more space in the back by the wood burning oven but i actually liked sitting right next to the bar on the tables next to the brick you can see where the mortar has crumbled away in the brick wall and where theyve stuck a few wood chips to keep out the draft charming the rustic outer surface is decked with various signs of harley davidson and moosehead fame but still they have this almost posh vibe from hanging chandeliers and the beer tap backlight with several shiny gold tilesthe mixed drinks are delicious and unique the hey lucy specifically ive never had alcohol soaked gummy bears before but omg theyre the most amazing things ever something about leaving those gummy bears in the bottom of your glass until the end makes the flavor just pop in your mouth im tempted to try it at home verythe food was also excellent we had sweet potato fries which were served with some sort of aoli type sauce the grilled vegetable panini is delicious and ive never seen so many options to eat goat cheese my obsession as per cheeses currently the quatro formigiani is a great flavorful pasta although its very heavy and thick with cream sauceif i could id go back here on a regular basis,1.0
we came to vegas in our rv and ended up staying a few days because of an engine problem after picking up parts at the cummins dealership i did a search for organic restaurants and found this place not far out of our way its in an industrial area and not that easy to spotdrove by the first time and had to turn around once inside this cozy little place we were pleasantly surprised we have a lot of dietary preferences and rarely eat in restaurants  we are also totally unfamiliar with caribbean food the owner was happy to answer all our questions as we deliberated over the menu options the food was delicious with an interesting combination of seasonings we especially enjoyed the cheesecake dessertnext time we pass through vegas we will definitely stop in againhighly recommend this place,1.0
this place is definitely five stars i love the way their menu is organized and the philosophy behind their restaurant all of the plates are made to share so as a party you can share twice the number of plates that you could get by yourself a restaurant that encourages sharing thats already a win in my bookmoving on to the food everything i had here was amazing we started with the duck fat fries which were absolutely heavenly you would think that fries can only be so good but these are some of the best that i had we had the duck liver agnolotti which was amazing as well id highly recommend you share it amongst two people since after eating about 2 pieces it was definitely hard to handle it was very rich and flavorful absolutely heavenly the grilled octopus was decent the flavor was great but i think the octopus may have been slightly overcookedfor our main course we had an entree of seared scallops they were cooked to perfection and the pork belly on the top definitely accentuated the flavor i would highly recommend getting this dish i have nothing to complain about the service was amazing nothing much else to say about it waiters were all very friendly and attentive all around just an amazing place will definitely be coming back,1.0

always hesitant to give a place five stars but oh man the food here is so goodwe had two of the specials clams and cauliflower in cream sauce and bone marrow with caviar both were freakin delicious the clams were fresh and perfectly cooked the bone marrow was decadent i wasnt sure i would like it with the caviar but the flavors were perfect togetheralso had the foie gras forgot which one but it had maple syrup in it and fries made with duck fat yum yum yumwe figured that we should order the pied de cochon i mean the restaurant is named for it so it had to be good it was however our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and by the time we got the pig we were stuffed stuffed we had to get it wrapped up to go and we ate it for lunch the next day it kept very well note the mashed potatoes that accompanied it were amazingthe service was ok our server was really warm and welcoming and he really knew his stuff and he was super handsome but it was a pretty busy saturday night so it was difficult to catch his attention at timesa few final things make reservations weeks in advance the floor is slippery i will definitely be back if i ever find myself in montreal again,1.0
the one star refers to sales associate michelle  i requested alterations for an ankle length pant that was a bit too long  michelle was sent to the dressing rooms to assist with this and immediately projected a negative attitude and rude tone  instead of assisting politely and patiently to determine the length of the pant she asked another customer if she needed help  i had to wait for her to finish with the other customer  she insisted that she couldnt assist with determining the length of the pant due to my socks being on  she did inform me that the pant came in a short length and that shed have to make a call  after making the call she informed me that indeed the pants come in a short length in all colors  i stated that i wouldnt be able to try them on and she abruptly shouted they fit the same  when i voiced my concern with the manager she informed me that they dont actually fit the same the short length is a bit shorter in the rise  without saying a word about my thoughts of michelle my daughter said shes an angry elf  michelles tone and attitude was not the same with the other customer  she showed her patience and a calm demeanor  maybe this michelle is prejudice towards japanese women,0.0

this is the absolute best chinese cuisine in the area  whether it is the pork chicken or beef you can taste the freshness in every dish  the atmosphere of the restaurant is quiet and peaceful  it doesnt matter if you decide to dine in  or you are driving by and decide to order a takeout  or my favorite lazy way of preparing dinner  delivery  mmmm every dish is freshly made  the only negative comment i would make would be the price  for a single meal includes signature dish served w white rice meals are 1222  other than that excellent experience,1.0

stayed in the salon suite in the tower suites area of encore it was an incredible experience the room was huge with a dining area massage room living room bar area large bedroom and an amazing bathroom the checkin desk was in a private and elegant area we were served bottled water while we waited an additional hotel rep came to greet us personally and we were given her business card if we needed anything during our stayour room came with inroom breakfast every morning at night we would call in our order from a preselected menu  items such as french toast oatmeal omelet eggsbacon croissant sandwich etc as well as coffeetea  in the evenings we would get turndown service slippers were set out the lights dimmed chocolates next to the bed and fresh bottles of water set next to the bed for us it was wonderfulduring our stay we used the salon and barber shop and spa as well as the golf course saw le reve every employee was wonderfully accommodating and so polite the hotel is so much quieter than the wynn and feels much more intimately classy and it smells so good i bought the scented oils sold in the home store so that i could experience it at homeif you cant decide between the encore and wynn you cant lose either way i personally liked the encore more for the fact that it was quieter and more intimate however most of all the attractions shows golf course shops sports book etc are at the wynn so we did a lot of walking the wynn is just as beautiful the rooms are large and gorgeous and it is convenient to every want and need you may havebut if i had another choice it would be encore hope to see you soon,1.0

you know its bad when the malls owners let the bank take it over  losing macys was a massive blow and they owned that robinsonsmay building too so no rent  theyve been struggling for a very long time now but the surrounding area just isnt rebounding enough to support a regional malli remember when they lured best buy from across the street borders was supposed to have the other floor good thing they got dicks instead and several chain stores express new york and co used the low rent to expand and remodel while the mall did a refresh yanked out second floor carpet for tile  so many storefronts are closed now  its really sad to remember how crazy busy this place used to be during the holidaysthere will never again be the plantlined courts where sam goody and music land were built on top each other next to the wellstocked everyoneshopshere sears no overpriced but unique suncoast across the ways and no surprisingly good buffet at kings table  wizards of the coast the music box and beanie baby shop cookies and corn dogs and mozzarella sticks from the neonlit food courtat least we have the memoriesdont be surprised if you are asked for money by people in the parking lot or they try to sell you something  avoid the ridiculously rude survey people in front of dillards if theyre still there,0.0
tldr recommended for your ramen itch broths are well crafty with balance and flavor in mind orders are done on order cards to the cooks relatively speedy deliver of ramen to your mouth in about 6 minutes depending on the complexity of your orders wont hurt your piggy bank do you remember the first time you tore open a 10 cent pack of ramen paying careful attention to pour the exact required of water to cook hopefully not just the noodles but also warm up the soup base to eat at an adequate temperature maybe cut up some spam and sauteing it so to give it a little char crunch maybe even fried up an egg for extra protein well this place is the more adult version of that instead of tearing up a pack of ramen you instead sit at the counter with other ramen compatriots and place your orders through an order card so any mistakes is probably made by your hands literally if you have any questions or need a recommendation a cook is promptly ready by to answer your needs a far cry from your youth but the smell the sight the taste the textures and the soup will bring it all back to youi had the chicken paitan which is the special for that evening its a thicker creamier style chicken broth were used to but it is hearty and meaty in the broth you can smell the good quality bones alliums and aromatics i elected for char siu for the extra protein it was moist slightly smokey from the braise with an extra touch of burnt flavor from the blow torch they use to warm it up behind the counter nice generous size on the order of char siu the crisp from the char portions of the meat is a welcoming addition the green onions bring a refreshing pungent presence like your cousin gary when he came out at your last family reunion the ramen is surprisingly springy think of al dente and soft on the palate its really well balanced between the subtle flavor of the flour and kansaiall in all the experience is speedy but not rushed affordable but doesnt leave you feeling you relapsed into the package style ramen i highly recommend this ramen shop for its shop cooking ability and simplicity of which it delivers nostalgia albeit a little more ramped up and tastier,1.0

just got a letter from the epic owner brent which was very nice and rather surprising how often do you hear from owners of companies brent addressed my concerns viewable below and even sent us a 16 check to make up for our lack of a discount its very impressive that a company pays attention to its reviews yelp or otherwise and tries to address those concerns as i mentioned in my first review below i would have definitely used epic in the future but after brents thoughtful and polite letter to us i plan on using epic sooner than i planned and i have gone out of my way to mention this company to coworkers and friends in fact people havent believed me that an owner of a company actually apologized so i have to show them the letter excellent customer serviceand just to confirm i honestly did not even have a problem with epic cleaners when it came to the actual cleaning they did an absolutely fantastic job with no upsell and they got the icky pet smell out of our carpet like pros epic is the antithesis of a shady company brent truly cares about his customers and even as a cynical city girl i really appreciate brents dedication to his business and customers there is absolutely no reason not to use epic carpet  tile care and now that you know the owner truly cares about his customers this should be the only carpet and tile care place you use,0.0

ive been coming here off and on since drs howie and joy opened their practice off and on not because of issues but because of insurance reasons  they bring a whole new meaning to dentistry i really dont know anybody that truly enjoys going  to the dentist but they do a gentle touch technique that makes it very pleasant afterwards  dentistry has changed so much and the drs and their staff are just great   they really do take their time with you and take a conservative approach to their profession they arent quick to refer to oral surgeons or doing drastic procedures they make great notes and look at the notes the next time to check for changes  i love this ive had dentists in years sat just want to jump in and go to extremes rather than taking a watchful eye to a situation i highly recommend them if youre new to the area of looking for a new dentist to come to even my daughter doesnt fight me when i tell her she has an appointment   its a non event for her,1.0

under new ownership  the old place was scary  the new owners are cheery and nice  great prices 2000 for mani etc  they have about 65 of the 85 new shellac manicure colors  great new massage chairs  ask for michelle or tiffany  the great thing is that the music isnt horrible still going to be adult contemporary stuff but at least no bolton and the products are good  they dont sit around and talk about you always my annoyance at the nail salons and the massages are great  they also do brow waxes but i havent tried that yet  parking is weird there is plenty of it but virtually none in front  they are speedy and efficient which is always nice  especially if you are in a rush  the great thing too is that they have a tendency to stay late past their normal closing hours so if its a true nail emergency you know you have a chance at getting in even if youre ten minutes after closing,1.0

i wish we could give zero stars because that is what they deserve this company uses very aggressive and dishonest sales tactics to get people to buy points for a vacation rental they dont tell you that the number of points required for a weeks vacation will increase over time we joined 8 years ago and were able to use the points for a one week vacation in sedona now those points dont get a week we now get a lower quality room for fewer days the rooms are dirty smelly poorly located and not upgraded this past vacation we had to change rooms three times before we could find one that was habitable but certainly not luxurious the rooms that are renovated and have views are too expensive now and unavailable when we bought the points i asked if inflation was possible and they lied to us telling us the points needed would never change the other problem is that the good locations are never available any more for example we can never find availability in hawaii its impossible to sell the points once youve purchased them we are stuck paying the constantly rising yearly maintenance fee until the day we die stay away from this company,0.0

my cousin had recommended me to go to taz for brazilian waxing ive had nothing but negative experiences with other salons so why not give this place a try right its a home salon and located in the basement its currently under renovations but i can already see that it will be a gorgeous salon i arrived at 1130am and met the lovely taz she is a very very sweet woman i instantly felt very comfortable with her she reminds me of my own mama xd we began talking as she prepared me for the waxing she could tell i was nervous usually it takes about 1020 minutes for the aesthetician to wax but took taz only 6 minutes i was surprised at how fast and gentle she was i was so so impressed and was so happy i was completely relaxed 3 minutes in and it was already over 3 minutes after that she is an amazing woman she made sure i felt comfortable and relaxed and it didnt hurt as much as it usually does im so happy i met her a sweet woman with years of experience its probably the best waxing experience i ever had thank you so much again taz,1.0

beyond the fact that these people are scam artists ill review my entire experience at this place in case the fact that theyre handing out stock images isnt enough regardless of if you believe its an honest mistake or not they obviously dont know how to do their job if they can touch up and print the same photo this many times without noticingit was very clear that the woman providing the ultrasound had absolutely no idea what she was doing she was regularly scanning over my hip bone and kept shaking and lightly hitting my belly  the majority of the ultrasound was in 2d once she finally flipped into 3d i was so disappointed it was so blurry and difficult to see anything she had to point everything out to me and i had to take her word for it on what i was seeing  she reassured me that the pictures would be clearer once printed i was skeptical but who am i to question i was asked to wait in the waiting room a few minutes when she emerged she gave me 2 clear photos i was so impressed that she was so capable of touching up these photos so well well turns out i have 2 of the stock photos    i would strictly give this place a bad review based just on the blurry ultrasound video the fact that i know 5 women right now who got the wrong gender and that she handled my belly so roughly during the ultrasound  i have since gone for another 3d ultrasound elsewhere and saw her take screenshots at the time of the ultrasound those were the pictures i actually received what i saw on the screen was what i got and when baby was in the wrong position i was asked to roll over no one touched my belly without permission,0.0

i love this placewe eat here fairly often i am a big fan of the spring rolls the vermicelli and the rice roll  grilled pork r05 on their menu my only complaint is that the person who does the rice paper steam rolls does not work about 50 of the time and we love these so it is a bit of a disappointment when they are not availabledelivery is fast and so is takeout they seem to do more take out than dinein so the place is generally fairly empty inside which i prefer i have always gotten friendly service herei dont like cold rolls so i cant comment on them but my boyfriend had the chicken curry and it was also quite good,1.0

this was my first visit to any of thomas kellers restaurants and i cant wait to try the others we had to catch a show so we ate an early dinner right when they opened at 5pm it seems like a lot of people also go here from brunch so i cant wait to try that next time he ordered the special artichoke appetizer and the chicken the artichoke hearts were lightly breaded and fried the batter was very light and was not oily at all there was a pimentel aioli to dip and tiny slivers of olives as well the watercress on the top was a nice touch too the chicken was probably the best roast chicken weve ever had the skin was crispy and the meat was extremely juicy the jus was so flavorful and i could not resist dipping my bread into it the server informed us that the chicken was in a brine and then left to rest for 24 hours before being roasted it was served over having eaten a late lunch only a couple hours before i ordered the house salad and the special crab appetizer so adventurous i know i wish i ordered more but did not want to feel the guilt of wasting food that took so long and so much care to prepare the house salad was full of fresh mixed greens topped with a round of herb goat cheese and tossed with a red wine vinaigrette with shallots it was amazingly light and very generously portioned the crab appetizer was a cold platter with a large claw and leg it was served with lemon and 3 sauces 2 of which we were sure were the same they tasted almost exactly the same one was a mustard and the other was your typical marinara sauce the dessert was the absolute best part of the meal it was the special of the day the bottom layer was thomas kellers own oreo cookie topped with a mintinfused bavarian cream full of chocolate crunch balls then there was some sort of spongelike layer over the whole thing it was to die for there was a mint streak on the plate and a double chocolate ice cream as well this was a euphoric moment to have this with a cup of strong black coffee,1.0

the security guards attacked my cousin and left him unconscious they caught him with a flask and when they asked him to leave being a sweet guy that he is he was completely compliant  my family and i saw them drag him to the elevator and choke him till the point of unconsciousness  we will never forget his face it was so traumatizing please do not go to marquee it is not safe this happened to us and it can happen to anybody else this place is dangerous,0.0
my boyfriend and i came here a few days ago for our 1 year i had no idea what to expect but good lord was i in for a treat our server was nate and he was extremely knowledgeable in all of the steaks and different types of wine well worth the price ive never had better steak we ordered sides of artichoke and brussel sprouts and both were also to die for our waiter knew we were celebrating and gave us complimentary sauces for our steaks and a desert where they wrote happy anniversary ps their butter cake is legitimately the best thing you will ever put in your mouth at one point the owner came by our table at least i think it was the owner or at least a manager to make sure our meal was ok and we couldnt praise enough so thanks arrowhead grill and nate for making our night so wonderful we tried to track down the guy who stopped by our table to sing praises on our server and couldnt find him so i hope this reaches someone i recommend this place to anyone and everyone wanting to splurge on a romantic and delicious meal,1.0
this place takes the typical pub food but takes it to culinary genious the pretzels and fondue are amazing all the food is pretty good and the prices are what you would expect for a higher class establishment valet parking is free which is a nice perk they also have games inside come on down and enjoy where the hipsters hangout they know good food when they see it,1.0
i dont usually take the time to write reviews but i couldnt be happier with the service that these guys provided so im making an extra effort to write this review if you own a bmw like me the first thing you are overly worried about is how much is it going to cost to fix after the warranty runs out well my warranty ran out and i had a problem im incredibly happy to have found sw bimmers after recently having a suspension problem that was not a very apparent fix they spent the time to diagnosis the real problem before just changing out a bunch of parts they replaced my rear spring and my car was back in order i have found sw bimmers to be honest experienced and provided me with a great service experience i highly recommend them to anyone needing bmw service and repairs in las vegas and i agree with everyone else who has written reviews here im never going back to desert bmw again,1.0
horrible service  thank god ahs assigned me another company  argued with me about a leak and claimed they fixed it  i paid for over 5 lbs of refrigerant to refill my unit    a few months later my ac stops working again  they sent out french who came with an attitude  all the refrigerant gone out of my unit again a  r complete service corp  is probably the least professional company in town if you need hvacrefrigeration is the worst  service  experience  according to french  the  senior tecnitian  that was assigned   he verified previous techs diagnosis all and all we had five different visits for the same unit  this last visit he was offensively impolite and one of the worst  and negative experiences i had with any company  i would never recommend this company ,0.0

let it be known this review has nothing to do with the personelle at this place  they were all great and were the only reason we stayed there for the few moments we didhowever if the very basic requirements for any establishment housing people are not met  we have a serious problemour pyramid deluxe room was moist musky and upon further inspection riddled with black mold didnt find that out though until the morning after we stayed when both my fiance and i woke up sweaty dizzy and nautioussure they comped the resort fees and hotelscom refunded the entire stay  but i would have honestly paid any sum of money to leave that place as soon as humanly possible i have no idea about the quality of the other rooms or if the luxury suite they offered us is any better all i know is that if anywhere in this day and age knowingly allows these types of conditions to exist and worse allows people to sleep there with their loved ones  than they are setting a dangerous precedent for an utter lack of regard for human safety i wont step foot near this place again everand would advise you all to do the same,0.0
i dont usually rate clubs  same reason i dont usually allow photos after a certain hour or certain number of drinks  but this place wow  if you want to live like a rock star this is the spoti wont tell stories but yeah a good spot well worth going  go big or go home cmon youre in vegasi read  bunch of other reviews of this place so just a quick note for anyone not getting it  you get what you pay for  i didnt wait more than 4 minutes to get in  treated like a celebrity and surrounded by some by the way this place rocked,0.0

atmospheregreat place to go with your friendscustomer servicegreat staff i dont know if its a hipster thing but all their staff are younger and super positive seems like the type of place i would love to work atfood i love the sunday sundae i guess they change it up every week and honestly the presentation of all their dishes are awesome also you have a choice to go healthy or not so healthy so its a great place to go if you have a vegetarian or vegan friend cause they have a lot of vegetarian dishes and for the most part you can modify a dish to make it vegetarianprice for the quality and amount of food that you receive its inexpensiveoverall experienceoverall awesome great job guys few places i can say this about but i could actually eat at skinnyfats every meal of the day every day,1.0
what i really dont like about living in this place is that whenever i go to office and ask maintenance to do some work into my apartment the front office have always said that they will put in a work order and that they will be coming by tomorrow or the next day but guess what that work order i put in was about 7 months ago when we moved in here and yet the only thing maintenance have done was take out my screens n checked out my dryer and that was it and they said that they will come back tomorrow because they didnt have any screens on them so that was 7 months ago and yet none of the work orders ive put in still havent gotten done whatsoever and this was the first day i moved in which was in july now its february and yet still nothing i actually just gave up on maintenance around here so i basically started doing every maintenance my damn self and said screw the staff here but what pissed me off most about was when my neighbor moved in they automatically have maintenance fixing everything in their place and yet i was just like wtf dude what happened to them coming here but oh well were moving out anyway once the contract ends so i dont have to deal with the constant empty promises given by the front office staff,0.0

good times to be had i saw my first ever live ufc event here  the venue was pretty niceeasily accessible i hate venues that dont have enough entrancesexitsbut mandalay is well laid out i swear theres not a bad seat in the place we had the up top section  and since mandalay is not that big compared to arenas like honda center and staples you still get a great view i could hear the leg kicks and smell the sweat from our seats nice seating was not overly cramped either like you might expect from a smaller venue  ahhhhgood times for sure,1.0
ok here i go againthis is a fantastic place wonderful wonderful wonderful service seriously they are all so nice in here and the foodso fresh and so amazing portions are the right size and healthy i have had the grilled chicken energy bowl  it was great seasoned chicken and vegetables the 5k salad  this is truly an amazing salad i cant do it justice with my words just go try itnow and the flatbread chicken avocado melt  um yummy the hybrid punch is really tasty too sometimes the wait can be a bit long so do yourself a favor and order ahead if you are on a lunch break but do not ever let that stop you from coming here prices are a bit more than you are going to pay at some places but hands down  it is worth it when you want really good food that is good for yougo here,1.0

admittedly im a poke box addict i go here at least once a week and the super friendly staff now knows my order its great that i can walk in and smile and watch as the soft sushi rice base is thrown into its brown cardboard chalice its followed with a delicate yet necessary spray of seaweed flakes before being passed down the proverbial pokessembly line where two generous clumps of red and white crab salad are lowered into the lair then the magic happens cucumber edamame onions and jalapeos accompany soft and succulent morsels of salmon sashimi as a waterfall of spicy mayo and unagi sauce drowns the ingredients in a marriage of culinary delights the mixture is gently spooned into the box and topped with an optional drizzle of unagi essence now at the end of the line crispy fried shallots and wasabi peas dust the box as if to place the cherry on what would have already been a perfect sundae,1.0

holy cow chicken and pork hands down the best bbq in phoenix everything is well prepared and filling best go with an appetite and best get there early because they can sell out of things really fast im normally not a big fan of creamed corn but these guys have converted me and im hooked definitely will be back for more good job guys,1.0
lets see where to start got the fried mac n cheese bites that just happened to be filled with boxed mac n cheese definitely not home made and the baked beans canned pork ribs were extremely over cooked as was the beef brisket the brisket looked like days old pot roast completely grey in color and dry as a tube sock no smoke rings no moisture at all it clearly won the bbq championships fifteen years ago because it wouldnt win third place at the local retirement home with what they serve now if you want consistently good bbq go to dickeys,0.0
i love everything about this place the staff decor food the owner all of it the servers bussers and runners are all friendly and all have awesome personalities the head honcho though is kick ass hes hilarious and always takes good care of us every time we come in ive tried almost all the pancakes they have but my all time favorites are the lips red velvet with strawberries and the always november which is pumpkin pancakes with whipped cream and cream cheese the only bad thing i have to say is that the location is small hopefully in the future they can knock down some of the walls and make the place bigger because it is a little cramped aside from thatprompt serviceawesome staffbomb foodwhat more do you need there wont be a sunday that i dont have breakfast here,1.0
it disheartens me to rank them so low they were once a favourite for my wife and i to visit but our last two times here have been very disappointing the quality of food was once upon a time among the elite of whitby but now falls in line with what i would expect to get at jack astors dont worry though they still charge you premium fine dining priceslets not forget about the service the waitress was aloof and seemed to really not care too much for her career choice maybe im just a snob but when youre clearing all the tables and preparing them for the next days breakfast ie removing the table clothes and putting out jams it really gives whats priced to be a fine dining experience a real ghetto feel maybe thats their new niche though ghetto fine diningneedless to say unless they can go back to their ways of old i wont be going back again,0.0

this is the most unprofessional office i have ever been to  i made an appointment for a potentially life threatening situation   i arrived at the office and filled out 5 pages of forms  when the nurse called back she began asking questions  i mentioned that i had seen a gi doctor early in 2017  she said oh i need those records before dr haikal will see you  i am on a new job and still on probation  i cannot take off just because  she refused to let me see the doctor  i was very upset  no bedside manner whatsoever and certainly no compassion  needless to say i got the records and my husband took them over to their office  i had written a letter to them telling them that if they need additional blood work to let me know so i could do that prior to my visit so i am not taking so much time off work  i received a call from the nurse stating that dr haikal refused to see me as a patient but she did not know why  that is total bull she knew exactly why  what an unprofessional cruel thing to do to someone who is very scared and concerned  the whole staff is rude and very much lacking in patient care skills  when it is all said and done it is probably for the best as he sounds like a total jerk  i will be seeing a different doctor next week  patient beware  you cant be too careful in this town   i wouldnt recommend a sick rat to this place,0.0

i understand this is a new concept to the area phenomenal idea the mangonadas are not traditional which i understand everything has become more americanized the wait time is always outrageous i would not recommend especially if you are in a rush or even on a lunch break it is also about 95 degrees in the building so i would recommend waiting outside for your order but dont do that or lose your receipt with you order number because the extremely rude staff will not give you your order and will also accuse you of trying to steal someone elses order would not recommend many other great places of the same concept just have to travel about 15 min west of the location of this place,1.0

we went to las vegas for my wifes birthday and spent the weekend at the venetian hotel we are not big on gambling but love the night life and excitement that vegas has to offer this place is absolutely beautiful and has such wonderful atmosphere with great italian renaissance elements everywhere our room was upgraded free to beautiful suite with all the amenities you would expect in a five star resort we walked around the strip and found it to be not as exciting as it used to about 10 years ago the strip is dirty and full of people trying to sell you stupid things and not family oriented but we took a walk for the experience and to take in the lights and excitement we quickly decided to return to the venetian to have dinner inside the resort i will strongly recommend this hotel for vegas you will not regret it and of course we plan on coming back soon,1.0

walked in about 745 on first friday and were seated right away  we managed to squeak right in between the post work crowd and the later diners but the place was 90 fullservice was fast and friendly the waiter took his time making sure we understood the menu and explaining everything to usi had the bavette al cedro and my friend tried the gnocchi alla lupa and we shared the lamb side  honestly the pasta alone was good enough that i could have passed on the side but im so glad i didnt  not sure how they prepare the lamb beyond the slow roasting but it was tender and very moist  i think i detected among the garlic and sea salt a nice touch of saffronmy pasta was cooked just right at first bite i was taken aback by how lemony it was but quickly realized that the flavors were just perfect  they balanced out in all the areas of taste  i tried my friends gnocchi as well and it was also just right the serving sizes were just perfect not overwhelming but not skimpy either i walked away glad i didnt eat more and able to pass on dessertwe each had a four peaks i had the 8th street and he the kiltlifter and my only complaint there was that they were bottled and not draft the whole meal was surprisingly quick and the service was spot on  i would love to go back and try a few more items off of their menu,1.0

i dont know where to begin  as of today we have been without internet service for 6 days  we finally got someone out today to fix our service  well see if it lasts  it started last monday its now saturday when we had intermittent connections  i called tech and after a long long menu finally got connected  he ran me through 30 minutes i kid you not of fixes and i finally got so frustrated i threw the phone down  my husband took over for another 15 minutes or so  we were then connected for about an hour  then we went to the brick and mortar store and were greeted by a very rude associate who just wanted to sell us another modem when we already had 3 in a year and a half period of time  we walked out frustrated again  finally i got ahold of betti a gal who has been there a long time  by then it was thursday with intermittent service the whole time  more off than on  she scheduled a tech to come to our home on friday  we waited the 4 hour period on friday finally called to see where he was and was told they didnt have an order for our house  today we were scheduled again for a time period of 91  he arrived at our house at 400  im very very unhappy with century link as a whole  i feel for 6 days basically without service we should get a reduction in our bill  i wonder how long we will wait for that  our contract is up in august and i think we will be looking for another service,0.0

if i could give it zero stars i would clustered mess from the time we walked in to the time we left our only saving grace was stephanie the only person who seemed to try to help us checked in at 4 with the thought of having two rooms both with king sized beds being we made reservation directly through marriott got two rooms with two double beds not a huge deal but keys didnt work to the room this happened two more times before they sent someone to fix it did i mention the phones didnt work either we had to wait and exorbitant amount of time for the elevators every time been a fan of marriotts forever even am a elite reward member would never stay here again,0.0
fan of the loving hut not this one very disappointed i ordered a tofu dish with vegetables and the amount of vegetables was embarrassing how few were included in the dish small tiny pea like size pieces cut up in amounts that i would guessestimate would barely fill up a few tablespoons i looked at the plate in disbelief how stingy the vegetable portion was the other dish ordered was a dish we ordered many times at a phoenix loving hut and this one in comparison had little in the way of flavor and was a noticeably smaller portion both of us also came away not filled up we wont be back at this loving hut and will continue to give our business to other loving huts,0.0
do not even get me started with this joke of a restaurant let me just start off by saying just because you are coming in with a groupon does not mean you need to give mediocre service the reason i gave you a shot was because you advertised a good deal and i paid more than my share even after the groupon value it took two hours from start to finish for our dinner service 15 hours of it was just waiting for the food because the kitchen was backed up they were pushing out other peoples food that came after us so how is the kitchen backed up waitress mexican girl with the attitude never asked us if we wanted refills on our drinks is it sad that our four year old had to ask for a refill on her drink they ran out of beer so we had to get a margarita which is fine now heres the kicker our waitress came by to finally take our order mid ordering she just leaves no excuse me just up and walks away she literally walked away to give someone their food an drinks and then decided 6 minutes later to come back and finish taking our order now im not sure if chips and salsa are given complimentary but we certainly did not receive it i would not go back and highly recommend anyone who is thinking about coming not to either there are plenty of other small business owned restaurants in mesa to give business to just do not to ritas,0.0

we have tried this place numerous times attempting to give them a second chance after reopening  our last try was a disaster  the service has always been mediocre and the food has declined greatly supporting small businesses in gilbert has always been priority to myself and my family and i will always give them a second try but after a third try with this place  its done our server richelle provided us with less than mediocre service she introduced herself and mentioned she would have someone shadowing her we asked for water cocktails and an appetizer the chips and salsa that they charge you for were delivered to the table immediately about ten minutes later our cocktails were delivered along with our water i would think it would be much easier to bring water to our table immediately since the restaurant was empty the chips are paper thin and the green salsa is sweet and the red tastes like its out of a jar theres no flavor whatsoever when our appetizer nachos arrived they were very soggy due to the thin chips we asked for a spicier sauce that was supposedly hot according to our waitress it too turned out to be mediocre after that we decided to go home and door dash some better options for more authentic mexican food our waitress only appeared at the table three times once to take our order once asking about our food and delivering our spicybland sauce and finally to deliver our check she seemed too busy gossiping about other restaurants and their lack of customer service as mentioned earlier we will not be returning to this restaurant due to mediocre service and tasteless food if youre looking for better mexican food options look elsewhere because this is not the place for you,0.0
i would say that this outlet has a lot of the premium brand outlets that most people would be looking for although i thought this place was total crapthe common areas of this mall are all outside so each business has doors to go in its like a giant strip mall for people not familar with the stores names you have no idea whats inside so many of the window displays were hard to see so we didnt end up going in many stores this is probably the first mall ive went to in my life and not bought a thing lots of stuff here youll find at other malls,0.0
what a total waste of time to save a few   rude clerks to boot  i booked a car on southwests website for pick up at the airport in vegas and as everyone else experienced it took literally 1 hour to get thru the line and their was only like 15 or 20 people in it  i mean for like 2 a day more you can book another company and save grey hairs and hours of your life  i dont know about you but an hour of my time and stress is worth more than 2how hard could it be to staff more clerks when its going to be busy  the most frusterating part is that they know it will be busy because they have 90 of their reservations ahead of time  i swear the management here must be complete idiots of not really give a crap about their customers or the future success of their business  who ever is staffing this place should be fired immidately and replaced with anyone  i think the any drive thru clerk at macdonalds could do a better job ,0.0
visited pittsburgh this past weekend and went to sienna since we heard there was a beer garden lol arrived at 730 and put our name down on the first floor  aaand the wait was an hr n a half long tt so we just proceeded to the 3rd fl rooftop bar and got some beers to start wow the rooftop is just beautiful the place was packed on a sat evening most of the tables were taken and even the balcony was packed thankfully we were able to get a table for our group of 5 i was starving and wanted to get some appetizer to start but apparently the menus are different on every floor the beer list was quite extenisve but appetizers were not too appealing so we decided to wait it outfinally after some time our table downstairs was ready at last thank god for that refreshing watermelon beer to keep my mind off of the hunger lol the menu on the 1st fl was all about them balls of meat  it is exactly like the meatball shop in nyc which i absolutely adore so we knew exactly how this was going to go down pick a type of ball a sauce and a side  i got the saucey balls which is a set of 4 and i picked the traditional beef meat balls with pesto on top  i was also ecstatic to see a menu for poutine my o my i got my tater tots fix alright  added some bacon to it and had a side of chicken gravy for dipping  i wasnt big on the chicken gravy but surprisingly the tots tasted fantastic with the pesto sauce from my bowl of meatballs so huh how bout that tater tots with pesto i definitely struggled to finish all the things in front of me everything was delicious including their special sausage meatballs and boy was this hearty meal fulfilling and satisfying watch out meatball shop in nyc sienna mercato is right up in your alley lol i would not b surprised if sienna mercato makes its way to the east coast the variations offered at sienna is a huge game changer  plus tots im sold  sry mbs youre gonna have to step up your game to win me back p,0.0

this isnt one of those hipster we drip coffee through 18 different chilled funnels before we put it in your cup types of places  the coffee isnt the best ive ever had and theres probably way too much sugar in the syrups that i add to my peppermint mochas  ill likely end up with diabetes by the time im 40  however this peets still gets a 5 star review from me since every time i come in to grab a morning drink and sometimes an afternoon and evening one depending on the day im greeted by a genuine friendly smile and sometimes multiple of them depending on the time of day they seem to have increased staffing at busy times of day to catch up with the hoards of zombified nurses and doctors who drag themselves up to the counter at 745 am  there is no hipster im better than you air here just actual nice people  chatting with the baristas at peets is a great way to start and end a shifti only wish they were open on sundays and holidays but ill take what i can get,1.0

in the beginning 2004 we bought a new sienna minivan from a toyota dealership in minnesota three years later we traded it in for a lease on another new sienna we did the same three years later again in minnesota when we moved to arizona in 2013 we werent sure what to expect from the local dealerships not knowing any better we went to the closest dealership to our house  bell road toyota that turned out poorly high pressure sales people and lots of tacked on upsells when it came time to talk to the business manager we were determined not to repeat our mistake about a year ago we helped our daughter buy a used corolla at autonation toyota in tempe and the experience was much better so we decided to give them a shot for our own vehicle when our highlander lease was up it also helped that autonation has a great selection of in stock vehicles compared to the other dealerships around the valley i started by browsing their web site and once i found what i wanted i started an online chat i asked the agent to put me in touch with the fleet manager at autonation and within a half hour elijah eli owen gave me a call back he confirmed the vehicle i liked was in stock and we set up an appointment to come see it the next morning from the moment we arrived it was clear we came to the right place the difference was night and day where the bell road salesperson immediately started in on his slick schmoozy sales pitch the second he saw us eli did more listening then talking he answered our questions and we never felt rushed or like he was trying to steer us toward something we didnt want the paperwork went relatively quickly and we were in and out in 25 hours  much better than the seven hours at bell road and actually faster than any other dealership weve boughtleased from so far they do have a business office person charles in our case and they will try to sell you on extended warranties gap insurance etc but that is pretty common for most dealerships you can always say no and id recommend saying no at least at first  they will usually cut the price if you do we ended up getting gap insurance and a little extra coverage on the battery and tires but it only raised our monthly payment by 13 dollars from what we had discussed out on the floor thats a lot better than bell road when our payment went up around 150 during that stage of the negotiation so far the van has been great we had one question which eli was able to clear up via a very quick phone call it was worth driving an extra half hour to come to this dealership and i have no doubt we will be back in three years when were finished with this lease one more thing about bell road toyota  watch out for 5 star reviews they actually offered to give us a free dash mat if we left a 5 start yelp review sorry not gonna happen you have to earn that like autonation toyota in tempe did,1.0

my bro was the one who found out about this place and i gotta say im very glad he did its another korean restaurant i can go to when im craving for something quick authentic and freshservice was awesome and the staff was great i didnt catch our servers name but she was really nice the restaurant itself is a casual sit down not fancy at all it is very clean and pretty spacious throughout as for their menu it is very simple and theres not much you can customize i know some people prefer a more vast menu but dont let a selective menu fool you what i love about places with a very specific menu is that you know they are the best at making just those items  in most cases they are chef specialtiesi have tried their spicy noodle bowl spicy tofu soup kimchi fried rice and several other dishes a musttry is their fried dumplings they are homemade and you can tell by the flavor and quality you do have the option of ordering them steamed but the fried one seems to be more popularive became a regular here for good reason i love authentic asian food because being asian myself i am pretty picky about how certain foods will live up to my expectations so if you are looking to have a casual meal that has authenticity freshness and flavor i highly recommend this place ,1.0
after over a year of hearing all of my stores clients tell me how wonderful this salon is i finally went wow it has to be the best hair salon in scottsdale not just because it is the most beautiful because my hair color and cut is amazing if you are even thinking about going there it is a must you wont regret it,1.0

this review is a long time past due but as they say better late than neveri purchased a beautyrest katherine mattress a hybrid of memory foam on individual coils  from bedrooms today back in november the salesman david was very helpful and patient in helping me choose the right mattress additionally a few days later when my measurements showed that the combination of the new mattress i had chosen along with the box springs would sit up too high they came to the rescue with a solution replacing the box springs with a bunkie boardin spite of my good experience so far when my bed was first delivered it was so much stiffer than the one i had tested in the showroom i was immediately concerned david at the store advised me that it would take a while to break it in so i decided to give it some time a month passed and the mattress still wasnt comfortable to me i woke up frequently with sore joints and a sore back again david advised me that it sometimes takes up to three months to adjust to this type of mattress well as hard as it was for me to believe and as frustrated as i became he was exactly right by the end of three months the mattress was and still is so comfortable that i dont want to get out of bed in the morningill admit i was beyond skeptical but i came to find out that david was as good as his word i would definitely recommend that you give bedrooms today a try if youre in the market for a new mattress its too bad that mattresses such as this require such a long breakin period but my patience though i lost it a few times was certainly rewarded,1.0
ive been meaning to review ifocus vision center for a while now  i dont have any major eye issues so my experience with them is just a few appointments over the last two years but all my experiences have been greateveryone on staff is knowledgeable and makes sure to personalize everything they do with you to you  they are very digitally focused and make it easy to receive receipts and prescriptions  they are able to find my file and my information immediately when i have questionsi have not dealt with glasses here only contacts and vision testing and pretesting for lasikthey have some of the best most advanced vision testing tools and their prices are very reasonable  the office staff is also very familiar with most insurances and have no problem calling them for you  they are also great at following up with you when they need to go find some information  the doctor is also great remembers people and spends as much time with you as you needbecause medical care can be such a hassle with insurance and paperwork and receipts its really important to me to take care of these needs in an office which really seems to put the patient first  i am met with frustrations and disorganization with staff at almost every medical office i visit in las vegas with the exception of ifocus vision center  however they are doing it they should serve as a model for other local medical offices,1.0

i am very disappointed with my experience here this was our my husband daughter and myself 3rd visit and while not impressed our previous times today was a disaster the hostess was extremely rude the service was non existent and the food was cold the table next to us got their food ate and left before we got our order with no apologies or explanations we had brought a guest with us and frankly i was embarrassed because the location was my choice i dont see how this place rates the rave reviews i have heard i am not sure if its because we have a small child and they are targeting the hipster crowd but we felt very unwelcomed and unwanted there very sad and we will not be going back,0.0
we recently discovered this place through ubereats  so weve only ever had it via delivery so i cant rate the actual location  itself but i can rate the food even by delivery were blown away by how delicious the food is every time and using such simple dishesingredients weve tried a variety of their sandwiches marinated chicken  chourico and bifanapork and their side dishes potatoes and rice i cant even pick a favourite sandwich because theyre all delicious the meat inside is always juicy and packs such big flavour and the bread is always sooo sooo fresh  you can also choose to have the spicy sauce on the side the rice and potatoes are also very tasty and well prepared with great seasoning they take such simple dishes and simple ingredients and make them shine and at really great pricesive had homemade portuguese dishes which i loved and this place really has that home cooked prepared with love flavour  im craving it right now as im writing this  definitely ordering from here again and again ,1.0
most unprofessional establishment ive ever dealt withkeller williams put up a post for a property on trulia and within a couple of hours we tried to respond to it they completely ignored our calls and emails for days it took 4 days of calling for the property manager joni villalobos to finally pick up the phoneshe proceeded to give us some spiel about how she couldnt rent the house to us right now because she needed to talk to the tenant which i gather was a total lie we conceded but asked that we be first in line when the property is available which she agreed toof course whenever we would call to check on the status of the home she completely ignored us for a week she never responded once we tried to go through someone else at keller williams multiple times but everybody just said that there was nothing they could do we needed to talk to joni finally much to our surprise she picked up the phone what did she have to say they had rented the house to someone else 3 days agoit was a carnival of unprofessional behavior i asked to speak with her manager after we found out that she gave the home away of course the manager wasnt in they said that heshe would call us the next day never heard from themdont bother giving keller williams the time of day they dont deserve it we were treated like trash blatantly lied to constantly ignored and generally disrespected it amazes me that this place is still operating,0.0

i never knew this little sandwich gem existed next to my office its walking distance from our building so its very convenient especially if you got a precious parking spot that you are not willing to lose they have both hot and cold sandwiches you order at the counter and take a number they bring the food to your table i tried the philly cheese steak sandwich without cheese unfortunately and a side of potato salad the order came out pretty quick the food was hot and delicious the potato salad was fresh and was done exactly right even though my sandwich did not have cheese in it it was about one of the best steak sandwiches ive had the portion size was also pretty big i could have easily packed half my sandwich for dinner but it was so good i decided to just go ahead and finish it embarrassing i know prices are average so its definitely a spot you wouldnt mind visiting often im so glad my tl shared this place with me he has tried pretty much every sandwich they have and i probably will be doing the same soon excellent find,1.0

seasoned flyer here and beside myself in disbelief with aai have to say that all of the employees i dealt with were great my issue is with the operations of check in process in 2003 and 2004 i flew over 106000 miles on this airline what the hell happened to this company i couldnt check in online called and there were 5 aisle seats as well as others but they told me the airport had control of the seating and i couldnt obtain a seat even if i wanted to pay for the premium one i had to get my seat when i check in get to check in and they tell me i have to get my seat at the gate get to the gate and nobody is there wait 20 minutes and the gate attendant who was very nice walks up and turns everything on and tells me the flight is full and she cannot assign me a seat i told her that i called yesterday and their were 5 aisle seats available she said there arent any seats available at all and she was going to be calling for volunteers to give up their seats and take a later flight she said she would call people up to assign seats what a completely inefficient and painful process why do they make it soooo painful to use their airlinetake a lesson from southwest and think about the customer experience and cater your operations for them,0.0

my florist cafe is misunderstood  by nearly everyone living in phoenix you get used to how things are if you own a food spot its either a coffee shop a bar or restaurant much like the clear zoning lines between residential and commercial phoenix food spots are either this or that and rarely allowed to be anything else  it would be too confusingso while the complaints about my florist cover a variety of subjects from the lousy menu the lousy food and the lousy service its only compounded by the fact that when you enter my florist youre expecting to enter an actual restaurant someplace you can get hot food drinks and listen to jazz music while sitting there pretending youre in a completely different city one thats more metropolitan one thats more urban and cool one that doesnt shut down at 10 oclockmy florist cafe fails consistently and miserably oddly years of bad service bad food and surprisingly boring bread havent stopped people from giving this place a chance over and over againsure they have one of the best jazz pianists in all of phoenix at least that you can find easily without having to be in any sort of music circles but is that really enough with the servers dressed up disappearing regularly and delivering plates full of hard nearly unedible bread while having no knowledge at all about any of the wines theyre suggesting why do people continue to frequent this placei think our expectations are too high take away the bad service dont expect too much out of the food disregard any of the servers suggestions regarding wine and what do you have probably one of the more unique atmospheres you can find in phoenix for the price and the location there really isnt anything like the ambiance youll get at my florist cafewith an upscale decor enough tables to comfortably fit a small group the jazz piano in the background and the hum of coversation filling the room i would dare say that there isnt anything like this anywhere else in phoenix sure there are different places to go such as chez nous but comparing the two would be wrong where chez nous is a great dark soulful rb lounge my florists is excellently open and brighthowever in the end my florist cafe has spent years and years unchanged you can only say a restaurant could be so much more for so long after a while you decide to give up on it you decide that it really wont change you decide that for some unknown reason the servers are different every week and so are their managers  but at least the woman playing piano can generally be counted onmy advice try my florist once a year dont order any food and definitely dont order any bread bring some friends order a bottle of wine of your own choosing not the servers suggestions and have a great time in one of phoenixs few unique cafes,1.0
the reason why i give this place 5 stars is because our server was amazing she was very sweet nice and understanding not only was she checking in on us frequently she even gave the best suggestions for the food as well we got the meatballs tomato basil soup and the new york pizza her name was naz i believe very kinda and beautiful i will go here again and again if you continue to have people just like her thank you again naz,1.0

five stars dont cut it for this restaurant this place is crack they lure you in with their amazingly cheap prices and you get the biggest trip of your lifei tend to walk around my chair when i get a dish that is tasty well here i walked around the bar twicei went for lunch and they have this great deal for a prixfix for 25 choice of three appetizers 3 entrees and 2 dessert the fact that im writing this review after the entree means that i know dessert is going to be stellari started with the prosciutto which was accompanied with a burrata which was to die for very creamy served at the right temperaturethe entree i went for basil ravioli i dont know what it was filled with but i do know that i cleaned my plate the sauce the filling everything was just greatnow i just did my third lap around the bar after i tasted my tiramisu light and delicious perfectly balanceddid i mention everything is dirt cheap compared to other good restaurants in vegas prosecco for 9 all entrees below 30sherlynn was a great bartender easy to talk to sweet and on pointfor a moment you think your no longer in a mall but it brings your senses to italy they should change the interior and music a little to match the italian lifestyle,1.0

i was stuck in the drive through today for 20 minutes unacceptable ive been to this location 5 times and every time the service was extremely slow as well as having errors with my order i know this is an entry level job but i feel this location needs to fire everyone and start from scratch with people that have the experience and ability to handle the flow of customers this location happens to have a starbucks right across the street that easily does the same amount of business if not more and doesnt have any issues with speed or efficiency its pretty bad when you cant get a cup of coffee right it goes beyond screwing the pooch to the level of effing the whole pound,0.0

oh my oh my  delicious 21 year old bushmills is just the beginning of this foray into this authentic irish pub located in mandalay place which is the only drawback since you have to brave the lv strip to go there  my wife and i chose seats at the authentic wooden bar and she had stella and i had a perfectly poured guiness from bartender and irishman junior  everyone was friendly and irish in this joint and the smell of the food was mouth watering  i had the lambrosemary burger and bygum it was one of the tastiest burgers ever  lei enjoyed the fish and chips which were hands down the best i have ever had  the 21 year old whisky was the icing on this beautiful cake and i will return there in the very near future  expensive and a bit touristy for my normal fare but outstanding food and drink take up the slack  oh and it probably isnt very expensive if you skip the 21 year old booze   5 stars,1.0
i didnt use these guys for my care through pregnancy as i was planning a home birth but things didnt go as hoped and i ended up being transferred to banner del webb hospital to be induced yvonne downs the midwife that works here and at the hospital was amazing through it all she was so kind and compassionate and i truly think her hard work saved me from a csection when my little dudes heart rate started dropping during contractions she was sympathetic towards the fact that i had planned to have him at home and made me as comfortable as possible with the transition even though im pretty sure i said man youre bossy when it came time to push and she kept making me change positions to help the babys heart rate she was amazing and made the whole experience as good as it possibly could have been i dont know about the rest of staff here but i would definitely consider seeing yvonne in the future if i have another one,1.0

waste of time coming here for lunch  came in with three coworkers on our lunch break and service was horrific  we immediately asked for extra bean dip  our waitress stephanie took our drink order and said shed be back to take our food orders even tho we were ready to order right then  she proceeded to go behind the bar and make some drinks and ring some orders and check on other customers  she finally came back with our drinks but no bean dip  we waited and waited and waited for her to come take our orders and finally had to ask to get someone else to serve us  this turned out to be the manager  we had ordered four lunch specials and one to go  after waiting some more she came back and said we could get the to go order only at full price so we declined  we finally got more chips and salsa from our original waitress who brought two of everything even attitude  by this time we had been waiting for at least 30 min since the manager had supposedly put our order in  we got up and asked for the manager again since at this point we were running late for work  shes nowhere to be found until we get up to leave  she comes out with our food as were half way out the door saying they tried their best  no apology  she offered to box it up but for what full price since the special is full price to go no thanks cuz they probably spit in it anyway,0.0

bluf try it for dessert its a neat experience sit at the bar and take it all inthis was my first time trying a fancy dessert place i was a little hesitant seeing the prices but decided to try it anyway its advertised as a an enjoyable japanesefrench style dessert place and it definitely deliverstheres not much parking here but we found a spot quickly the area doesnt look like it would house such a fancy place but i guess thats where the hidden in hidden gem comes fromwe waited for 23 minutes to be seated and sat at the bar seating was a bit tight it takes a little while for someone to come by and take your order but we just watched the desserts being made this is was honestly a big part of why i liked this place so much it was fascinating to watch everything being made and all the steps that went into each dessert foodi got the raspberry sorbet and ichigo the raspberry sorbet was so packed full of flavor it was amazing the ichigo was delicious and is something i would gladly get again pricethe desserts are on the pricey side though i think you do get your moneys worth for the experience along with the food they do have a one main dessert per person minimum so be mindful of this if youre thinking of coming serviceeveryone was really nice and very courteous they observe some traditional japanese customs greetings and things they say when they leave a room which created a nice fun environment,1.0

oh my god i am craving this right now as i write this review as my extent of knowledge about canada goes which is very little nothing is more canadian than poutine right i definitely had to try this place out before i left canada even though poutineville was only half a mile away from our hotel i was seriously considering if it was worth it having to walk 10 minutes in a snow storm to eat here i may have gotten a little bit sick but all i have to say is that i have no regrets i was never ever a fan of carbs of cheese or anything that this place would stand for but somehow poutineville converted me i opted for the makeyourownpoutine menu since i was all about having it my own way it starts at 89 dollars and you work your way up depending on how much stuff you decide to put in your poutine from what i can recall i added mushrooms hot dog bell peppers gravy runny egg and some other options that i dont even remember i ended up with about 10 additional items on top which totaled up to about 19 just for that one dish that sounds like a lot but when the dish was served to us it all made sense it was huge  it was like 2 days worth of food for me and my boyfriend no way i would be able to finish that in one sitting after eating through 14 of it we decided to pack it up and enjoy it lateri wish i was able to explain how good my customized poutine was yeah the flavors didnt really match but i devoured it nevertheless i especially enjoyed the cheese curds and im not even a fan of cheese the service was quick and the drink selection was adequate if i ever find myself in montreal again you can almost guarantee that this will be the first place i will stop by at,0.0

i got to dannys on highland at 9am on a saturday in february 2013 and they were already super busy if you are crunched for time dont go to dannys its like going to walmart its a time warp i wanted  a wash and detail i figured id spend about 5075 however the salesman suggested i get my yellowed hazy headlight housing cleaned up which is desperately needed exterior wash wax interior shampoo and detailing both inside and out he said that getting the works all at once would be more cost effective for everyone than paying for everything a la carte according to their advertised pricing thats accurate then he gave me a discount on this package i then asked him how much this deal would cost me he replied 250 my jaw hit the parking lot yikes id gotten the same quote from toyota for the same service sans headlights i honestly figured dannys would be cheaper since its an assembly line and not a toyota dealership i was wrong i guess customers are paying for convenience since toyota told me id have to drop it off early in the morning for all dang day and come back late afternoon or evening for pickup that was without the headlights figure din then i asked how long it would take the estimate was 3 hours well choot i thought when will i ever get a full exterior  interior detail with headlight housing restoration so i did it i broke down and signed away 250 for the workswhich included without my full blessing cleaning under the hood my car hadnt been cleaned in 17 months and it sure needed it the 3 hour estimate was accurate and i simply walked across the street to the shopping plaza to entertain myself with window shopping and an early lunch when dannys called my cell i walked over and paid unfortunately you cant leave a tip on the card and i had no cash for the attendant i dont even know how many people worked on my car or if it was just one person hustling for the tip  my only complaint is that the tree sap on my car never came off in my experience you have to use rubbing alcohol to get the crap off even though it is supposedly bad for your paint i wish i had removed the sap myself before going to dannys but if you recall i was only preparing for a simple wash and detail i definitely got upsold but my car needed it and i consented so i cant complain my car looked and smelled so much better when i left its been 3 months and it still looks great,0.0

going to applebees after work for happy hour seemed like a good decision i remember loving the orlando location by my former university i came here with the intentions of a 1 to 2 hour meal with a few coworkers however this turned into closer to a 3 hour experience due to slow service i got the boneless hot wings and the wanton chicken tacos i am pretty sure the hot wings were straight from a freezer because of the texture of the breading the quality of the food i had from the happy hour menu was not too great and thankfully i only paid happy hour prices my happy hour margarita was just okay the worst part was the service the waiter stopped by our table only occasionally and walked off a few different times before taking the entire partys order      at the end when it came time for me to cash out the waiter brought our checks out with the orders not separated right this wouldnt be a problem if the following did not occur the waiter went to go make the needed corrections but then she comes back 15 minutes later and tells us to use the touch pad to pay on the table there is a touchpad available but noone explains how to use it at this point other than to bring the food the wait staff would be better replaced by the touch pad anyways     will i come back only if its my coworkers birthday and they choose to go to this place however i would never choose to come here when the decision is solely in my hand,0.0

since recently moving into the downtowncentral phoenix area my boyfriend and i have been trying new restaurants every chance we get there are so many great places around here but i felt like we hadnt been anywhere super impressive until we came to the parlor  a friend of a friend had recommended this spot as one of their favorites and im so glad we took that advice as we dont choose italianpizza restaurants as often as others for an appetizer we ordered the fritto misto crispy calamari  shrimp and it was delicious perfectly cooked and a great portion size as well we also ordered the pepperoni pizza for dinner and it was one of the best pizzas ive had in forever huge pepperonis and yummy chunks of mozzarella all over i wish i had photos but i was trying to play it cool lolin addition to the food i thought the atmosphere was great the parlor is a very pretty restaurant we sat on the patio and i loved it our waiter was great as well he even brought me a sample of a beer he thought i would like when the one i asked for turned out to be no longer available my one piece of advice would maybe be to skip the drinks all together though  i thought the food was well priced but drinks were very expensive so we could have cut our bill in half by just sticking to food,1.0

where to start i went to a big box store because they advertised free installation free stairs free free free got the quote back and it was over 11000 we have a big house feeling slightly defeated i went into brandi carpet chris was amazing he really knows his carpet i picked out one i liked and he scheduled the measurement just as chris thought the big box overmeasured by 30 square yards which added up to about 1k before taxes got an estimate back from chris that was more than 3000 less he scheduled me told me who would install the carpet and when they just finished yesterday and the house looks amazing the installers were so awesome i couldnt be more happy with the outcome and im ridiculously happy that i supported small business vs a big corporation thanks chris,1.0
i thought i was going to love this hoteland it has been a disaster of a trip to say the least  for starters they didnt give us the room we asked for they put us a coupleinto 2 queen beds but the water pressure in the room didnt work and neither did the tv we ordered room service a couple times and couldnt even get a hot mealor ever what we ordered and it got to the point that a simple waffle was too much for them on friday i called down to have the tv fixed and the water pressure fixed and by sunday afternoon nothing had been done i then went to the front desk where a manager  named sara and i user the term manager loosely proceeded to tell me that after all that we are going to comp the food the food that i couldnt eat because it wasnt cooked or i can give you a 50 credit  she was extremely condescending and i explained to her you are charging me 270 a night and i have even extended my stay and all you can do is give me a 50 credit and still not fix anything  she basically told me to take and moved me on my way i was willing to give this hotel a second try until i met sara and her condescending attitude and i think establishments especially in las vegas need to understand that customer service should be the foremost important thing sadly this weekend in las vegas at the aria dealing with sara it wasnt the case i guess i will be headed back to the wynn or the venetian next time i am here  disappointed aria very disappointed,0.0
the shvitz is a jewish tradition in cleveland that has been discovered by guys of all stripes  its greatyears ago they had a ladies night once a week but in this day and age no woman would step inside  the place has been there forever and looks it  i understand that now days you get a lock to use that is private  it used to be that one communal key opened all the locks on the lockers  they also have an armed guard in the parking lot and plenty of cops as customersmy routine was to take a shvitz and a playtzeh in the steam room  it is not a sauna  it is very wet heat  when i came out i avoided the pool of ice water because i think its the same water my grandfather dipped in  talk about a gene pool  that water hasnt been changed since bentske yornafter a shower i retire to the cots wrapped in a sheet in the darkened locker room  my buddies and i all grab a beer  cincy cream ale is best  and kibitz on the cots in hushed tones for a while  some may catch a few zzzz  its also this time when a massage is a good ideaafter a nice rest its time to go into the kitchen for supper  a juicy rib steak served on a wood plank and covered in garlic  add to that fresh rye bread with butter and a slice of pickled red pepper  you want salad  you get a nice slice of onion  the appetizer is a slice of matjes herring  an acquired taste but one that i acquired as a small childback in the days when gay solomon owned the shvitz it always seemed to cost 28 no matter what i got  dont forget to tip the playtzeh or the masseurthe shvitz is hard to find but its a great trip back in time to 1920 or so  try it,1.0
if you want real korean food this place is not the place  service was poor and quality was poor  agree with some that other korean bbq places wirh korean people there eating is a good sign of good korean food at a restuant  no korean people present except myself at this placethey charged us 18 tip atomic ally for 4 people  a diet coke was 6 and one half corn was 4   not worth it at all  go to a real korean bbq restaurant if u want authentic tic food and dont waste your time herebeen to la new york and atlanta to name a fewand this was not even comparable to those restuarants  if you are ok with eating over priced non authentic korean food and being charged for 6 dollars for a diet coke and getting bad food and service  this is definitely your place,0.0

we had tickets to the michael jackson immortal tour on sunday night  we arrived in a sea of people went downstairs to will call and then back upstairs to get a drink  then we waited in a cattle call to get through three metal detectors  there were thousands of people attempting to do this  what a joke the planning of this event was awful  they didnt inform folks that there was food and drink inside  as well when the event was over the las vegas marathon ended right at the exit we had to take to get out of the event center and to and through a narrow walkway in the casino  there were 44000 persons added to the already 20000 plus who were exiting the show  if there had been an emergency there would have been no way to help a soul  they are really lucky that nobody from the marathon was so tired that they passed out  i am very disappointed in this terrible planning  it took us an hour to get to the front door of the casinohotel  and then we had to take an overcrowded tram to another hotel  it certainly is not designed for 50 people but up to 50 were jam packed in  we are lucky we didnt roll off the track  what idiots,0.0
i love the bacon bar this bar has excellent service amazing food and a great atmosphere my husband and i typically go on sundays to watch our detroit lions games and eat breakfast right when you walk up to the door you can look at a map of the bar and see which games are on which tv theres no guess work or having to walk up to the bar and ask where your game is going to be this last time we were at the bacon bar they had raffles each quarter and you could win prizes who doesnt love prizes,1.0
i was going to write a very mean review of this company because i felt lied to and almost duped i came very close to believing what they were saying and giving them some of my hardearned money after further consideration i realized that it isnt their fault that they are just confused and dont know the true meaning of the word free  it all started like thisi received several calls from a lady asking if i could attend a presentation which in exchange i would receive a free 2000 travel voucher for just attending  still suspicious i asked the nice lady on the phone several times how long the presentation would last what we were required to take and what we my fianc and i would receive she stuck to her story of it costing us nothing we could leave after the 90 minute presentation and that the gifts were ours to keep with no ties involved there was some discussion between my fianc and i about when could go we decided to attend their saturday midmorning presentation ok i know i sounded too good to be true and i should have been wiser im sorry for being optimistic i often think that humans have good intentionswell we showed up 15 minutes early for our appointment on the 3rd floor of the jockey club as instructed 30 minutes later an older gentleman led us to room where we were shown an infomercial and given a kind of motivational speech about how geo holidays does not have pressure salesmen the main speaker scribbled many numbers on a white board in no particular order we listened to the speech and watched the film then were led to some rooms that are just like what you would be investing in from there we were led to an open room with several round tables the older gentleman called over a decent guy named jim jim asked if we were ready to invest when we said it was too much for us at the moment he offered us a special low price for locals the way it was presented it was kind of appealing but we stuck to our selfmade prepresentation goal not to buy anything so again we said we werent ready to purchase anything at that time jim left us so we could talk about his added bonus of a free four day three night stay in disneyland which he would include only if we invested today  then he returned with a property that was just put up for sale at a bargain price because the previous owner was in the navy and was relocated out of the country again said very politely said  no thanks we arent ready to invest today jim left saying he was going to get the guy to give us our gift this time a gentleman of few words named jonny showed up and in broken english and even worse writing and number scribbling tried one last time to sell us whatever they were sellingby this point we were annoyed frustrated and tired of sitting listening to people talk to us and not listening to what we were saying when i asked about our free gift jonny said ill go get it and be right back  we watched jonny walk away and sit at a different table queue vinny im going to refer to this poorly nutritioned highly tattooed man as vinny because he didnt have a name badge and did not introduce himself to us kindness was not his forte rudeness and shortness were two character traits which he possessed quite a bit of  vinny again wrote some numbers mumbled some stuff about something and then offered us our free gift this free 2000 travel voucher requires you to pay 199 per person and travel tuesday through sunday of certain weeks you can choose a cruise a hotel in hawaii or some time in disneyland airfare taxes and reservation fees were not includedthe free tickets were to shows that required at least a two drink minimum so you can walk in and sit for no money but to stay you must give someone moneyin conclusion obviously the geo holidays people dont know what free means you cant be upset at someone if they are confused or werent taught correctly but if they were taught correctly and they do know what free actually means then those people are liars and untrustworthyfellow yelpers you have been warned talk to them at your own risk and for your information thefreedictionarycom which i paid nothing to use defines free as acosting nothing gratuitousgeo holidays i hope that you learned what free means from me for free,0.0
lack of service from the short hair bartender tonight at around 1115pm she even yelled at 2 customers for not tipping to her likening as they were exiting the barso originally i was at buffalo wild wings to catch some sports when i became hungry and decided to not have their wings but to come to bar and enjoy their wings instead because theyre amazing once we arrived we were immediately greeted by the bartender and served our 1st round of beers and then it was left at that the place wasnt busy at all but the bartender made sure to pay attention to certain players she never showed equal service to all of her guests and we were never able to put any food order in or even a 2nd round of drinks so we decided to leave and take our gaming business elsewherei have a lot of respect for bar as their ambiance is great and their food menu is outstanding but the service definitely lacks in my 18 year hospitality experience if the customer service fails to even meet minimum requirements then they represent the company in a poor way a little good service can go a long way or better service can keep the business in a 5 star rating,0.0

roughly the same menu as babbo in nyc which is one of my favorite restaurants  i didnt find it particularly loud or salty or rude as some of the previous reviewers mentioned  i dined at the bar though  the chef  sommelier were also eating at the bar it was late and they offered me a few bites of random things  was nice  i had the mint love letters with lamb ragu  excellent as always  and the fennel dusted sweetbreads w onion jam and duck bacon  also excellent,1.0

we went here based on all the positive reviews i should have lowered my expectations we ordered chips  guac and several 99 cent tacos fish beef  chicken the tacos had a hard shell which i actually like and were topped with a ton of shredded lettuce and shredded cheddar cheese i mistakenly thought this food would resemble authentic mexican it did not cheddar cheese does not belong in the kitchen of any mexican restaurantthe beef tacos were 80 lettuce 10 cheddar cheese and 10 meat seriously wheres the beef they give you more meat on the chicken taco i decided not to eat my remaining beef taco instead i gave it to my husband who ditched the lettuce cheese and shell and added the beef to his already skimpy taco the food was along the same line as taco bell i dont dislike taco bell i just prefer real mexican foodthe guac was not bad it was also covered in cheddar cheese,0.0

i was almost scared off by all the negative experiences reported by others but since the price was half what alamo or enterprise quoted and ive used advantage in other locations with no problems i decided to risk it maybe i just arrived at a good time a tuesday evening in may but there was no line at the checkout and 3 or 4 clerks on duty so i only waited a couple of minutes the clerk was very friendly and did not pressure me at all to take their insurance extras or prepay for gas so i was on my way to the car in about 10 minutes no wait at the pickup desk either the only hitch being that the car had a lot of cosmetic damage on the body so i had to fill out the form they gave me and turn it in before leaving they made a copy and let me keep the original despite its scruffy appearance the car was pretty nice for a managers choice special being a kia soul with a backup camera climate and cruise control plus the gas tank was full and interior was clean when i returned the car checkin was very quick and the attendant confirmed that i would not be charged anything extra and emailed me a receipt on the spot bottom line it is possible to have a good rental experience with advantage maybe just avoid busy times and have reasonable expectations for a discount rental company,0.0

hello bistro has been on my short list of places to try when traveling to pittsburgh for business   i ventured there at around noon on a thursday afternoon  the place was packed  most tables where occupied and there was a line for food but the line moved very quickly  i approached the register ordered the salad bar 795 add chicken for an additional 2 and quickly took my place in line to have an employee prepare my salad to my liking  i love the idea of a salad bar where the employees prepare the food  no germy customers touching the items   the options are endless   lots of healthy options starting with your choice of greens  i chose the kalespinach mix but there was also spring greens and romaine to choose from  i topped my salad with quinoa yum chickpeas and lots of other fresh veggies  there were raw options and roasted options in addition there were 3 options for chicken tandoor fajita or saltpeppergarlic  i opted for the latter  my selection was then passed on to the next station where it was chopped topped i chose pepitas and dressed  i really enjoyed my salad the portion and value was spot on  ill definitely go back,1.0

i love coffee and i love starbucks i go everyday many times to multiple locations this location has nothing wrong with it if you like to have the most annoying flamboyant young man working there he sings in an annoying voice at the top of his lungs thrusts his flamboyant personality upon everyone in the coffee shop and is a constant distraction with his antics as i sit here trying to compose this email he is making it difficult to even think because he is singing disney soundtracks a couple of other customers have commented on how distracting it is because his annoying and shrill voice breaks into every conversation thats being had it makes this starbucks dreadful when he is working i understand having fun at work and having a personality but he is infringing on people that come here to have conversations conduct business and even study he is a nuisance i wish him terminated,0.0

5stars all the way petlandca  as soon as i walked in i was acknowledged by a staff member  nothing huge just a nod to indicate a hello i know youre here  i like thati walked around looking for a new aquarium to replace my small cracked one  i was interested in the new modern looking design of the fluval edge  i was concerned about the design and how to clean them  the staff member saw i had a question asked if i needed help and proceeded to tell me everything he knew about the unit  i was impressed and i was on the fence about getting it but because of his help i was convinced it was the right decisionthey were about 30 more expensive than the local competitor so i asked if they would be willing to match the price  the staff member took the time to check their website and when the price wasnt listed online he took the liberty to call the store directly  thats great customer service because it showed he was willing to go out of his way to help  i usually dont ask for price matches but i thought a 30 difference was quite substantialif you ever need any advice on fish or aquariums go to the sunridge petland and talk to tim  hell be able to help you outps  i have to note that this petland is very well laid out and is one of the only pet stores that i dont have air quality issues with  i have asthma and am allergic to a lot of animals  when i walk into most pet stores i have difficulty breathing  not at this store  good job sunridge petland,1.0

i was here during the las vegas marathon with my girlfriend and some friends  this was hands down the best steak house experience ive ever hadthe atmosphere of this restaurant is completely different than what im used to  it caters towards a younger and trendier crowd it is las vegas after all which is something not often seen in chicago  with that being said the quality of the food did not suffer one biti forget what everyone else had that day but i ordered the 18 oz bonein ribeye cooked to perfection at medium rareand surprisingly the part of the meal that stood out the most was the truffled mac and cheesei know what your thinking how good could mac and cheese possibly be  thats what i was thinking too  i was actually leaning towards something more expensive as my side dish but the waiter kept insisting i get the cheaper mac and cheese  wise choicekudos all around to the chefs and the outstanding service  i will definitely make this a regular stop every time i come to las vegas,1.0

like the accidental tourist and many other people we happened into this place after dropping a boat load of cash on two glasses of wine at postinos after getting the car from the valet we started to drive away from postinos and spied aiellos  after a quick tour around the block once again passing the valet who shot us a confused look we turned in to what has become one of our favorite haunts for a quick glass of wine and some fantastic new york italian fare the ambiance is subtle and not over the top but who doesnt like a huge christmas wreath over the bar all year round  the wine selection here is minimal but good with a house chianti that was better when we first started going but has been replaced with one that is almost as good  but i prefer the sangiovese mostly because i like to hear angela one of the servers say sangiovese in her romainian accentfairly sexy so much that  to my wifes chagrin i began calling her sangiovese girl i digressbread is an important part of the meal for me especially when splurging  the bread here is over the top good dense and flavorful  they import special peppers for the oil that they serve with the bread which is slightly spicy and a must when you eat here  the peppers do make a difference as when they ran out and had to temporarily use other peppers it was not as good  every dish that we have tried has been fantastic with favorites that revolve around the special ravioli of the day the veal and the mushroom are best to me joes famous spaghetti and meatballs and the tortelloni  my wife is especially fond of the fried artichoke hearts  all in all i have not had a bad meal here and have had many over the top meals leaving me fatter and happier and ready for a nap  the owners joe and myra go out of their way to make people feel at home with an atmosphere that is very family oriented  soon they will sell pizzas out the back doorgood deal i cant wait and if i can convince them pizzas at the bar easier said then done to convince them  all in all a good staple italian restaurant that makes my heart warm and my tummy full,1.0

i met dr athari in 2011 because of a sensitive side tooth decay i had ever since then i have referred my mother and father and sister to him as well as some of my friends i needed extensive fillings because of large decayed teeth he fixed them all over a short period of several visits and i see him regularly to prevent any more headaches for myself what i love about him is the fact that he takes so many pictures from whatever it is that he is doing in my mouth and shows them to me afterwards he explains all of it in detail and a few years later another tooth had been bothering me so we both could go back in time and look at the tooth that he had worked on before we initiated a new fix he even says it is hard to remember every case and writing detailed notes is not a comparison for actual pictures of each stage each picture speaks a long story by it self as a result of the dental education i received i have become a better more informed patient and have learned that caring for my teeth is a lifestyle as he says it my treatment was easy compared to my mothers case which was far easier than my fathers case my mom had old crowns from decades ago that had failed and created a major cosmetic nightmare for her she would always cover her smile and her pictures her hand was always covering her smile and laughter she was so conscious about this that all of us knew this she would not even hide the fact and she always mentioned how embarrassed her teeth and gaps and smile were on top of that she was very anxious about the dentist and was deathly fearful because of her past experiences an emergency swelling and situation brought her in he had to work very hard reprogramming her fear and anxiety before she allowed him to even get close to numb her up long story short many visits and many years later finally my mother was comfortable enough to allow him to do a full mouth reconstruction for her and cosmetically fix her crowns and veneers she goes out of her way in pictures with her smiles she cried of happiness when the crowns were delivered and she could see herself in the mirror without the major gaps and the wide teeth she too is very careful about her teeth now and not a day goes by that i dont see her beautiful smile my father has also experienced major dentistry from dr athari he had to first remove all of his top teeth and most of the bottom teeth had dentures for a while this year dr athari placed 5 implants for him on top jaw i was there and he had a videographer video the whole thing and take pictures as well all i know was that he said it was a very hard case due to lack of bone i saw parts of the surgery too and it is beyond me how this happened but my dad had absolutely no swelling or pain took some days off from work but the next day called in and told them he wanted to come to work the implants have been solid ever since and he is awaiting the next phase all in all i am happy we met dr athari he calls after every appointment to see how we are doing i think to write about any practice or doctor it is better to be able to show a time frame experience as opposed to write what it was like the first appointment but thats just me i recommend him for anyone who needs a real dentist and someone who will be by their side as he only does one patient at a time,1.0

disgusting im completely appalled at how they let dogs feast on their plates and let them urinate in the patio it was my 21st birthday and it was nice up until i was eating and suddenly lost my appetite after smelling this strong urine odor the dogs had an accident and i told the waiter about it he brought out the manager and she told us that the patio is pet friendly if i knew they let pets defecate and urinate on their furniture i wouldnt sit outside and if i knew they allow the pets to eat off the same plates they serve to customers i wouldnt order anything the manager offered to move us a party of 9 instead of telling the couple with the two dogs to move since we had the problem with the pets emptying their bowls after she spoke to us she spoke to the couple with the pets and started to pet their dogs that was just a slap on the face how dare you have the audacity to tell me to move and then pet the dogs that just pissed under and around one of your tables bad management disgusting place they try to be upscale but allow urine even if it is outdoor seating its still a restaurant ive yet to come across another restaurant that allows the same thing to happen,0.0

my family and i paid a total of 177036 to stay at the linq hotel this weekend two rooms three nights you may think to yourself thats not a bad deal why is she giving them one star let me count the ways1 the entire hotel smells like an old casino filled with smoke which is typical of vegas but then someone tried to cover it up with mens cologne leaving the entire hotel reeking of old man2 want to request a clock radio to listen to some music seeing as youre staying in vegas and might want to have a little fun no can do could not meet our request to bring up a clock radio3 when i booked this hotel they told me that the pool is strictly 21 which it is but that we could take the kid to the caesars palace or paris pool awesome when we arrived the linq told us that the caesars palace pool was not open for the winter not awesome next day we have brunch at caesars palace brunch and whadya know caesars palace pool is open wtf then we go out to the pool to use it and they tell us we cant be there and linq patrons indeed cant use their pool 4 they only give you wifi access for two people in each room wow like it costs them more to let more people on super disgustingly cheap when we called down to ask if we would be able to perhaps get more people access we were denied of course and the internet they did provide terrible oh and dont try making any calls or sending any texts from either the lobby or your room there absolutely no reception anywhere 5 want privacy in your room while someone is using the bathroom forget it they have one very large door that rolls and doesnt fully close or lock6 want to enjoy a nice tv show while youre resting forget that too reception was terrible the entire time tried to watch the huskyusc game in our room and our experience was ruined the only redeeming quality about this hotel is its location take my advice and spend a little extra money and stay at caesars palace or the venetian if location is what you desire my family gave the linq 177036 this weekend and they gave us nothing if anything they made our experience worse would never recommend this hotel to anyone,0.0

 ill admit it up front maggie oakes wasnot my first choice for dinner on a saturday night in montreal so the fact that we found ourselves there was just a stroke of really really good fortunethe location on place jacquescartier is really great  dont be concerned with its proximity to ben and jerrys and old montrals ubiquitous teeshirt shops  what was a great location in april has yo even better in the summer months  inside is sleek and modern without pretense our service was fantastic our waiter max helped us with the menu and made some great recommendations a charcuterie appetizer and its cheeseboard friend both offered some quebec offerings i may not be able to find at home so it was a good start  we had a 60 oz bonein steak prepared for five off the menu and worth asking if they can do it for you the beef was amazing and the accompanying vegetables and potatoes could have stood on their own the wine and beer lists are diverse and priced well,1.0
okay i am going to rate this restaurant 5 stars but i will offer my fellow diners a word of caution please read to the end for my note of caution having said that i thoroughly enjoyed every meal ive had at this restaurant well usually start with the olive sampler for the table i usually order a drink with dinner please see below you know how some restaurants do great with starters and salads and fall on the entree not this place when they thought up the word umami they had this place in mind you really have to try the short ribs on a bed of risotto ive had it 3 times and i enjoy it more every time i go this last time i had the veal osso buco and what can i say it was beefy and luscious and melt in your mouth umami the service was attentive but not overbearing none of us got the dessert so i cant comment now for my word of caution we were having a good time and i wasnt paying attention  i ordered a blantons manhattan up it was tasty it was about an average pour in terms of size in terms of quality i would put it at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10 what is amazing is its price tag of 16 i dont think i was charged 16 in manhattan for a manhattan unfortunately i ordered  2 and 32 later i had racked up a bit of a bar tab i can just hear what youre saying caveat emptor  and youre right so to be fair the restaurant is slightly below average in interior design in terms of what you would expect for the quality of meal that they serve this is not the interior of 11 for instance or umi to compare you will pay about the same  but the wait staff couldnt be better the food couldnt be better just watch out for the price of the drinks perhaps consider stopping at one,1.0
ya know this was my favorite place in vegas until today we are frequent customers but i wont be back to this location after the way i was treated today my husband and i are celebrating our 15th anniversary and this is where i wanted to go for lunch i ordered my usual rocky road pancakes when they came they werent right they had chocolate chips on them instead of the normal marshmallows i sent it back and was sure to be nice to the serverafter all it wasnt his fault 25 mins later i still hadnt gotten my pancakes my husband had eaten his entire meal while i sat there and watched numerous tables get their orders ive worked in restaurants the common practice is to fix a customers order before working on new orders i complained to the manager and all she could say was theres a health inspector here and shes not letting us work really because other people have gotten their food no problem then she offered to take it off my bill gee how generous of yousince i never even got the food i walked out extremely pissed and will not be back,0.0

i have to say among the hawaiian places ive tried all over the valley this bar far is the most and most authentic portion sizes are huge and more than enough to eat there be full and take plenty home ive had the korean garlic chicken the hamburger loco moco katsu chicken loco moco kalbi spare ribs and the spamasubi i have never been disappointed food wise the place on the outside looks nothing short of standard and not anything special or impressive at all its rather spacious inside and average amount of seating for a family owned establishment its always a good sign when you see islanders eating coz you know the food is legit always people in here eating and always at least someone from hawaii inside enjoying the grub there the most recent time i went tho i have to say the service was on the poor side granted it was really busy that day but we waited for our check and refill on drink from at least ten minutes a server or cook from the back came out to help seat people and saw someone she knew eating and got caught up talking to that table for a while we kept trying to get her attention until finally the customer that was talking to this server told us that we should just go up to the counter to get someones attention excuse me poor form that person should told the employee hey well talk later you have customers and directed her to us so naw we sat there and waited and poor form on that server for having a ten minute conversation with a table when the placed is packed and we cant get anyone to notice that we want the check and to go boxes to dip outta there normally neglect of service is something i hold highly to food and dining establishments and take off a whole star for that but dam this place is so bomb with the food ill let that one time slide the customer service can make or break a dining experience for a person and if the service is exceptional or good like its supposed to be it can sometimes make the meal all the more enjoyable tighten up on that customer service then its top notch best hawaiian food in town,0.0

we built a new home with a washer and dryer supplied by our builder from arizona wholesale the unit did not work when we moved in in 2014 the dryer needed a new transmission the washer wasnt spinning clothes properly and leaked during certain cycles i dont know about you but this doesnt sound like a new appliancethe dryer was fixed and the spinning cycle was fixed but anytime it run on a small cold cycle it leaks arizona wholesale has sent companies out 56 times now to fix the issue and over a year later its still not solvedwe asked them to give us a new unit and they can continue working on theirs or even take it and refund us so we can buy a unit elsewhere and they refuse apparently whirlpool wants them to send someone out again when weve been told after 4 services it would be replacedits ridiculous that they are making this our problem when this unit hasnt worked properly from the beginning ive requested a manager be present during our next repair and wait while we run a load during one of the cycles thats broken to be sure its fixed the saga continues,0.0

i really wanted to like this salon the first time i went there to get my hair done i had to go back twice for them to fix the color i paid over 20000 for it then a few months later i went back and tried to give them another chance by seeing a different hairdresser this time when i needed my hair done again this time i paid 30000 and i had to go back 3 times in one week for them to fix the color and it still looks like crap i even debated on leaving a review or not i just kind of wanted to move on with my life because this place has exhausted me taken a lot of my money wasted a lot of my time and wasted a lot of my gas but ultimately i decided that i should leave a review because i dont want anyone else to have to waste that much money and time at this salon as i did if they dont need to just go somewhere else for your hair this place is not worth it at all,0.0

ive always wanted to try an arepa but thought id have to go to a bigger city like new york or a city with a much larger latino population i was thrilled to find out about this place and eager to give it a try i had the steak and hawaiian arepas both were great on their own but the sauces really put them over the top my favorite was the garlic sauce followed closely by the chimichurri wish they sold the garlic sauce by the bottle the pineapple sauce is a nice palate cleanser the ranchero sauce is like a creamy ketchup the peanut sauce was the only one i didnt care for since it was all heat and not much else i hope that they will expand their menu to include more traditional fillings beyond the chorizo im now a fan and cant wait to go back,1.0

menu  httpwwwmainelobsterladycomid1html her hot buttered lobster roll is worth every penny  its about 1900 and only comes with a bag of chips dill pickle spear and a lemon wedge  however she doesnt skimp on the meat or butter as most places do  the lobster was fresh warm tasty moist and simply delicious  the sandwich was very filling  the hot roll seemed to be grilled with garlic butter  roll was soft but edges were crunchy  you will need to use a fork to eat this sandwich otherwise you will have butter dripping down your hands and arms  her lobster mac  cheese is another popular dish  very cheesy moist with lots of lobster chunks  her traditional style cold lobster roll is also very moist fresh and seasoned well and is hugely popular  i highly recommend the maine lobster lady if you ever see her food truck  lobster lady please come back down to the state capitol for food truck fridays  we love you,1.0

lox stock is my favorite bagel place in town  they do some wonderful catering also  i always avoid the typical chain restaurants and while it may be hard to try a new place you will be happy with the food at lox stock  let the boring and unadventerous go elsewhere  it is quite possible the bagels at lox stock are the best you will find west of the hudson river,1.0

excellent plus size collectionhad a great experience here  holly was awesome she was very patient even though she knew i was not buying a dress that day  i think i found my dress there it is probably the one  the one for the cruise and my 20th anniversary  i am happy  i did not expect to get this kind of service in this kind of shop so i was very pleasantly surprised  the prices are good and the variety is awesome  i recommend it  if you are looking to be completely catered to this is not for you  but if you are on a budget and looking for a great dress and decent service this is for you  great plus size selection  good luckronney,1.0
i am not sure why there are so many bad reviews of this place the food is simple burgers salads fries but oh so good we also got beer flights which were enjoyable and desserts were out of this world we came with a 20 off coupon from the clipper coupons and a dinner for four ended up being a 100 tab highly recommended and coming back next time for buildyourown burgers,1.0
i just finished this and i can honestly say it was one of the worst meals i have had in recent memory the mac and cheese made a cheap velveeta dinner seem high class it was bland with a cheese sauce and i put it in quotes because that is as close as i could come to identifying it for the burger to offer options on a temperature of your choosing is a joke as it comes as well done as a fast food burger it had so few onion straws that we didnt believe they were included until we pulled it apart and realized there was a light orange color where the straw batter is assumed to have been though no actual straws were found now the real gem the meat loaf this is the equivalent of a kid cuisine meal except in a kid cuisine you get a dessert and the corn doesnt suck they also flat out forgot the salad that is listed on the website as included with the meatloaf though they charged us a 150 for as if we added it and then didnt even include it in our bag this like serial killers proves that some things are bad through and through ,0.0
im beyond happy i found this place i love the subwaychipotle model of food where you just go down a line and pick what you want and this food is fantastic like seriously bro i got so much food for like 10 i got steak chicken pig mac salad and rice for 10 man was this food good tooyou know a place is good when it open at 1030 and you get there at 1034 and there are already 5 customers sitting and eating in the restaurant kalua pig was the best thing in my opinion my second favorite was the katsu chicken both of these items i will get over and over again great place ill be back,1.0

i will try and keep this short but i wasted 4 days trying to talk to someone to get some help i had paid in full for a economy car  1299 per day got to the counter and he told me he was giving me a car with more leg room no mention of an upgrade cost i thanked him and mentioned i get upgraded often because they do not have the car i have paid for the upgrade cost for the next bigger size car was 10 per day almost a 100 up charge i was never shown anything of told about the 10 per day charge he printed up the paperwork folded it up and put it in a folder and wrote the space number on the outside the next morning i got an alert that my amex card was charged 304 i then looked inside the folder and saw the additional charge of 10 per day upgrade charge i immediately called the 800 number and was told he could do nothing while i still had the car but would have someone from the corporate office call me back that never happenedthe next day i called and was told i had to call the location where i rented the car over the next 2 days i call the airport location 8 times never had someone answer the phone and i left a message to please call me no body ever called me i then called the 800 number again and got a lady from  country and she told me i had to take the car back to where i rented it 3 hours away or take it to a local office that has an economy car i asked if she could tell me if one of the 4 locations within an hour of me had an economy car and she said she could not and it was my responsibility to look up the locations and call each one to find out if they had a car i spent 45 minutes doing that and none had an economy car i called the 800 number got someone from  country and asked a very specific question is there anyone at hertz i could talk to that had the authority to help meand was told noi asked again and was told no i had to deal with the office i rented from when i returned my car to the airport it was 445 am and my flight left at 6 am i was told no one would be at the counter until 530 my plane was boarding at 530 so that would not work i called hertz when i got home and told my long story to a lady and she said that she could only give me a 50 refund i told her i was going to file a dispute with amex and she said if i did that i might have a problem renting from hertz again i told her there are plenty of other car rental companies and i would not be using hertz againsoooooooooooooooooo if you are ever upgrade and they make it sound like they are doing you a favor ask if you are being charged for the courtesy upgrade and ask to see paperwork before you sign anythingsorry for the long storyi left out some more phone calls talking to people that could do nothing to help,0.0
ok so there is another teharu in scottsdale and it is amazing literally one of my favorite places to get cheap sushi thats still delicious so when i heard they were opening one closer to my house i was like score this is gonna be great but sadly it was not ive gone here three times at three different times of day and each time the sushi was lukewarm and the wait staff was rude i get that you take your chances with conveyer belt sushi and sometimes a roll just isnt gonna be great because theyre not busy and its been sitting out for a while its a risk im willing to take but at the other teharu if you ask them to make you a fresh roll they happily oblige whereas at the one at superstition springs if you ask them for a fresh order of anything or even for a refill they act like its the biggest inconvenience in the world on top of that the people who work there are just straight up rude they usually take a while to pick up the check which is annoying but not a huge problem except for last night when i was there with my sister and brother who has special needs my brother got sick halfway through our meal so my sister took him out to the car and gave me her card to pay for her food so im sitting there waiving at the waitress constantly and she ignores me for about five minutes before coming over and simply responding with what i ask her for the checks and she goes to get them when she comes back with the checks she hands them to me and asks so are they coming back or what and i told her no my brother just got sick so theyre waiting for me in the car i have the debit cards right here though then i go to hand her the checks back and she walks away i watch her go up to the front and pull out her phone so i go up there and i was like my brother is really not feeling well so can i get these checks taken care of to which she responded i just gave them to you why are you being so impatient thats when i just about lost it on her  sosafe to say i will not be going back ill stick to ahi in gilbert or make the drive to teharu scottsdale its worth it,0.0

i would never recommend this company to anyone matt has been absolutely impossible to get ahold of not only that but we had horrible service and it was a nightmare for our wedding after confirming on the phone and sending several emails confirming the contract price and time the vehicle showed up an hour and a half late to our wedding keep in mind we had ordered this for our grand exit with sparklers there was no car to go to and all of our guests had already left by the time they eventually showed up as soon as the driver got out of the car he looked at us only my husband me and the photographer left and said oh am i late after driving us to or destination which he didnt even know where he was going  we had to direct him he apologized and promised us a refund it is now a month later we have only received half of the refund my husband and i have both been emailing and calling matt everyday and he has yet to respond or tell us when our refund will be sent to us it is absolutely absurd and appalling that he could run a business like this,0.0

best products best prices hands down my boyfriend went in to browse the ecigarettes we have tried them before and had bad luck  first the owner opened door ten minutes early for him and happily welcomed him inside the store clerk really took the time to talk to to my boyfriend and help make the right decision on what ecigarette would meet his needs once they found the ecig he liked the store clerk who we found out was owner walked my boyfriend through step by step how to work and maintain the ecig ive been around to plenty of smoke shops trying to find a good ecig and high quality fluid with a price tag that isnt ridiculous we found it they even have an awesome bar where you can try different flavors the service wasnt what we would have ever expected from a smoke shop its not a bunch of young adults with a attitude or a pushy sales guy with questionable merchandise this is a local owned business with a great ownergo check it out,1.0

if you are looking for service this is definitely not the place to go it definitely misses the concept of what a restaurant ought to be the attitude and ambiance of what it means to sit in and dine at a restaurant is far below standard we arrived at the restaurant with several empty tables seating took another 15 minutes once seated we werent served our drinks until after the tables that arrived after ours got theirs and neither was our order taken until after theirs even though i had notified our waiter that we were ready to order i do not care if he is the owners son but to hold such a pretentious attitude at a family owned restaurant is rather unclassy ive withheld judgement the two previous times that i have visited the restaurant always giving the benefit of the doubt that they were just understaffed or there were too many customers but as a diner i feel that there is just a certain number of bad quality treatment that a customer can take needless to say we walked out after paying for our drinks needless to say i wont be back i much rather pay a premium and eat at roka akor or shinbay than sit through mediocre sushi and poor service,0.0

painful experience up sell for insurance prepaid gas gps was amateurish and unyielding nothing like getting a lecture on insurance and arizona liability law from a high pressure sales person disguised as a customer service representative  finally had to ask them please do not ask me the same question again more there were no other customers at the service desk and it still took them 20 minutes to process my reservation  in fairness to fox i am frequent renter at phx and dollar and thrifty are just as bad   enterprise is usually pretty good but their rates tend to be higher,0.0

came to eat here with my boyfriend and im so glad we did the atmosphere was very relaxed calm clean and the staff are extremely nicewe ordered the chicken to start off with it starts with a k karage i totally butchered it up and we each got a bowl of the spicy miso and the other spicy bowl of ramen tankono my spelling is horrible today but regardless of my horrible spelling the food was amazing the chicken was nice crispy and extremely juicy on the inside we both agreed that it was one of the most deliciously juicy chicken weve ever had our ramen were both delicious and fresh the spiciness wasnt enough to get you panting and dripping sweat but it was enough to help clear both our sinuses the noodles were fresh and had the amazing texture of freshness to it not too firm but not too chewy and the egg in each of our soups were cooked to perfection the broth of each soup was rich in flavor and mine had an extremely delicious creaminess to it you can tell they cooked my broth for awhile to get the soup the way it wasall of our food came out extremely quickly and the serving size was just right enough to make you full but enough for you to be hungry for your next meal each bowl of ramen was about 795 to 895 which isnt bad at all for wonderful service and delicious foodall in all definitely coming back here again when were near this side of town,1.0

i have been to churn several times now and every one has been a delight   the coffee shop aesthetic the combination of the smell of ice cream and coffee the friendly service there is an experience to be had here   this is also hands down the best ice cream shop in the neighborhoodwithout question  the choices of flavors are homemade and constantly rotate this keeps things interesting but if you are like my daughter you can still always get vanilla with sprinkles if you wish still   i would say as far as ice cream goes the prices are steep compared to say bruesters or a dairy queen but what you are getting is so much better that its worth paying a couple dollars more to take the family besides if you are having ice cream you already have decided to indulge youraelf do it right,1.0

the minute you walk in the door of the building you know you are in for a treat  the smell of hazelnuts crepes cooking should be bottled and soldi work next door to hazelnuts and it has become one of my goto spots for an awesome meal  i always get a chicken pesto crepe and it is always perfect  they are very generous with the toppings and the crepe definitely fills you up and i have a hearty appetite  there are small touches that they do that make the crepes stand out like melting the cheese completely and adding saltpepper on the finished product  the owner is always there and is extremely friendly   i am looking forward to trying one of their sweet crepes in the near future,1.0
im not a huge fan of raw food so i wouldnt scream tasty to any of their menu items however if i were to recommend anything at this restaurant  i would definately go for their pizza also you especially cannot leave this restaurant without trying their glutenfree dairyfree cheesecake to die for i return to this restaurant specifically for their cheesecake its obviously on the pricy side for the portion that you get but considering how many almonds go into this delightful tasty thing its worth every penny,1.0
the atmosphere is nothing special the food tasted like warmed up leftovers my daughter found a hair in her burrito and i paid 3500 for basically a terrible experience we had so much food leftover that stayed right there in the restaurant because we werent taking that garbage home i suggest a whole revamping of this restaurant and for the doors to be shut immediately yuck with a side of yuck,0.0
my family and i have gone to this restaurant for years and have always enjoyed it last nights service was absolutely terrible i understand it was cinco de mayo and was busy and we expected that around 5 we called and asked what the wait time was for a table in the restaurant for 9 and we were told about an hour we asked if they could put our name down as we would be heading up there right then and they said no they couldnt do that over the phone we had to be there to put our name down so 520 we get there and put down katy for a party of 9 around 6 we asked how it was looking and they said about another 30 minutes 630 comes around and we ask and they said we are still waiting on some tables to get up we continue waiting outside as we hear parties of 235 get called in for seating 7 we ask again do you know about how much longer we are told they are still waiting on tables to open we ask for some waters outside for us and the girl who brought them out walked away rolling eyes as we tried asking about our table i get it was busy and maybe frustrating we kept asking but it had been nearly 2 hours  at 720 again we ask we are told there is a party of 12 ahead of us now because they called in and put their name down immediately we are frustrated as we are told you dont do that so my husband is asking why we were told you cant do that and the girl in the front with the black shirt and long blonde hair in a pony tail who was anything but nice rudely says well i dont know i just work here so we ask to speak to the manager the manager woman in a green dress with brown hair comes over and we explain the situation and she says they called us a while ago that she was even outside calling us i told her thats not true we watched her coming outside calling people never once called us and im sorry but there were 9 of us if you truly called someone would have heard or every 1530 min we went inside wouldnt someone had said oh we just called you rather than sending us away saying they were waiting on tables to clear for us but she continued to argue saying she called us and said they would figure something out for us then she says shes sorry because there has been some confusion up front clearly realizing they were wrong so finally we are seated in a booth with two high top chairs at the end not the most comfortable but we didnt care at that point our server was very nice and quick to serve us which we appreciated and they did order a couple cheese crisps for us since we had been waiting so long which was nice so we finally got to order and eat by the time we left which was right after we ate since it was so late was 930 4 hours of being there again i know its a busy day but seems a little absurd and the service in the front by the host and manager was uncalled for,0.0

i ordered a down filled puffer coat on ebay that was very rare and when it arrived it was huge on me i started searching for a tailor in toronto that would be capable of basically remaking the whole coat in order for it to fit me i was absolutely blown away by the job that was done at magic tailor they did it in two days and it would be impossible to tell that it was ever touched even though the whole jacket was essentially taken apart i am extremely picky and like everything perfect as i work in the fashion industry myself i dealt with the owner who was beyond kind and extremely knowledgeable i could not be more thrilled with my experience at magic tailor and i will return again and again,1.0
i went there for a late dinner and we wanted to sit at a booth in the dining area but my friend wanted one of the specials you can only get at the bar  i dont like that you can only get certain specials if you sit by the bar especially when the place is some what empty they should allow you those specials anywhere you sit  its a pretty ugly atmosphere dark and boring  my friend and i sat at a high table close to the bar and at that end they had a cart for dirty dishes sitting just across from us gross  but just wait it gets worse i ordered the bacon wrapped scallop pasta with salad and garlic bread and my friend ordered the pizza special  her pizza was dried out and nasty and one of my bacon wrapped scallops had a hair wrapped into it yum yum i love eating other peoples hair  the pasta with my dish was pretty bland and boring  the salad that came with my dish was a ceasar with way too much dressing and when i asked for less on the next one they gave me none also when the waitress brought another salad serving she didnt offer me cheese on top and completely disappeared i literally had to go to the bar and get the cheese shredder myself and shred my own cheese  i wish i could give it a 05 but apparently thats not a possibility so its a 15 for their um well the garlic bread was good  never going here again though,0.0
this place is gross my kids were covered in ants and we had to move to another table 15 minutes later he came to take our order 25 minutes later her brought our drinks we asked how long till our order would be ready and he said shortly  20 minutes later i went up to the counter to ask if it was going to be done in the next 5 minutes because we were going to leave the manager said we just put the orders in the over and it would be another 20 minutes  then he asked what flavor were the wings that we ordered  i told he we are leaving and he said sorry   one hour and 30 minutes of my familys time was waisted i will never go there again,0.0
we visited the location around 330 to grab an early dinner we and two other couples came in around the same time we stood at the front for almost three minutes without a soul greeting us there were two tables in the restaurant but no server bartender or hostess could be seen the entire time we waited we ended up leaving but i decided to call the restaurant and call the manager while he was very apologetic and offered to purchase something if we returned we decided not to based on past reviews of service,0.0

i cannot say enough good things about our experience with the olmstead team were first time home buyers and had no idea what to expect from the beginning with house searches and touring to the end when we signed our paperwork the team made us feel important informed and excited about the life decision we were about to make we specifically were especially pleased with mark wyant and monica who were available to us 247 and quite honestly we still keep in touch to this day their knowledge not only about the home buying process but about homes in general was extremely impressive they truly are not only the best real estate professionals but we consider them friends i could go on and on about all the good things we experienced with our team but i would recommend them to anyone looking to buy or sell a home and cannot thank them enough for making our dreams a reality,1.0

zen buffet in glendale arizona  run away  fast  am usually the kind of guy that can find the silver lining in almost any situation ie our server was a most excellent mouthbreather  but as i write this review i still remain unable to find any redeeming quality whatsoever  it should be known1  im a guy2  im single parent w kids3  i can be stalinesque when it comes to buffets ie quantity has a quality all its own  which should be a godsend to ownership when rating a buffet  my expectations are low to startas such i am also very forgiving regarding buffets  food doesnt have to be awesome for a passing grade from my boys and i  it just cant suck  same thing with service  if were missing a place setting or salt  im the kind of guy who will just snag one off a neighboring table  and still tip  place has to reeeally go below and beside the call of duty to rate a negative and yet ill still tipbut thats how i roll  zen buffet  how much do i love thee  id planned on making  list thanks to the generous 15 off zen was offering if you mentioned yelp  but alas weve yet to find a thing  what we did notice however is as follows1  my boys and i have renamed the restaurant the dancing queen as this was the only song that played repeatedly for the 1st 44 minutes we were there  we were having fun watching and listening to the folks around us as they would come to the same sudden realization p2  much of the food was empty ie crab legs hey at 12 for dinner id like to have the crab legs as advertised  i asked the attendant  refilling the food twice if she would pleease refill it  it took asking the gentleman who was seating up front to get anything crab legs  and then the other patrons were busy waiting in the wings gobbled them all up in about 90 seconds  never refilled again either oh hey  i actually can say something good about this place  they refill the rice and noodles quite well  but now back to it3  one of my favorite dishes  salt  pepper shrimp  was misidentified and not available despite signage indicating otherwise  the salt  pepper frogs legs were as advertised  just ultra weak in the spice and ultra old  the shrimp in the bin that had the salt  pepper shrimp sign was red  and breaded  and cold  health department4  the lo mein noodles were bland and devoid of any flavour whatsoever as were the rice noodles  and the creepy looking fried rice bright yellow was so hard bland and cold that we spat it out  1st time  ever  5  the wonton soup had not wontons picked out  no baked scallops in the baked scallop it was chopped krab that was baked in a scallop shellit took us that long and 40 bucks to realize it was time to leavei decided to take one quick walk back around the sushi spot  like before most of it was out  the sashimi on the far left side of the line looked like it had been cut and set out the day before yesterday  quite unappealing and i was actually afraid to touch it  felt i owed yelp a review due to the 15 and i really feel bad for the ownership who will in all likelihood be out of business soon  and the summer hasnt even started  looking forward to my first real review when i can report on a place that i actually want to go to vs hungry boys who spotted this place again as we were driving by today  off the cuff review here forgive the spellingtensegeneral spaciness  were still hungry  but for something edible o,0.0

this was my first time ever at pir and my firstever nascar race as well so i was very excited about it and my friends i went with were really happy i could go as theyd been wanting to get me out to a race for quite some timei like that parking is free out there crazy enough that any kind of sporting event is usually overpriced between foodbeveragessouvenirs so the fact that parking is free is a benefitwe hit up the souvenir booths and got souvenir shopping done first thing each of the vendors were friendly outgoing and really having fun talking to the fans and selling items from there we took all our goodies back to my friends car locked them up and headed back in for the days eventsso many awesome things to do and see out there many different food and beverage vendors for a variety of options is great because if you want something outside the norm of everyday food or fast food this place definitely has it from loaded baked potatoes to turkey legs something to consider however is with as big a place as pir is you definitely want to be wearing comfortable shoes preferably tennis shoes walking shoes or some kind of sneaker we saw a lot of females in flipflops but we also heard a lot complaining that they should have worn actual shoes too also being that the races are held in spring and fall consider bringing sunscreen especially if your seats are out in direct sunlight areas of the grandstands like ours were even on an overcast day you can still come away fried like a lobster from the uv rays that come through overcast and even dark clouds if you arent used to loud noise or have never been around a racetrack before bring earplugs in case i lucked out and the noise didnt bother me and my sensitive ears at all i actually enjoyed hearing the loud powerful engines roar by on the trackand one more fab tip theres not a bad seat in the house to sit and enjoy the beautiful mountain views and the races its all wide open and visibility is fantastic getting in and out of pir can be crazy if you arent used to it but i do recommend taking in a race and absorbing the whole experience and ambience of phoenix international raceway especially on a gorgeous fall day take my word for it ,1.0

i had never driven a subaru and did not know much about their cars when i walked into the showroom it was under construction but people walked up and greeted me immediately the reason why i give them 5 stars is because of their sales person cameron he was extremely thorough about what set subarus apart from other cars he was very specific about safety information and also the features available  he was under the hood explaining how subaru really took into consideration their owners cameron did all of this in the july heat cameron sold me on the car before i even drove it,0.0
trevor has helped me with plumbing issuesthree times now and i will not use any other plumber he communicates well and is very respectful and always cleans the area up after finishing trevor is the first plumber i have found that i trust his work is impeccable he treats every situation with a eye to on how he can fix the problem efficiently and with as little interuption as possible prior to this he replaced my hot water heater for me he repaired a gas leak and my disposal each time he assessed the situationthen provided me options my most recent call to trevor was for second floor bathroom had a leak going from my floor to ceiling downstairs trevor began by getting information about problem that was happening he then assessed by removing my toilet that was wobbling after checking plumbing he offered me 2 options to fix something at that point and be done or cut into floor to look at floor flange he explained everything so i opted to have him replace the floor which was the smartest thing because the lead bend was cracked trevor is very honest reliable and i recommend him to anyone,1.0
started going to this clinic when we moved just behind it in an apt building female dr came shortly after dr d patel very nice even my husband likes her and he prefers male drs  and lots of experience when she came from  england over 15 patients in her 2000 in england that had severe handicaps so this is awesome for us easy to understand very efficient dr y was not so nice arrogant about taking my handicapped adult daughter  he never went through with referrals he was asked to makeat least i heard from no one   so we changed when the lady dr came no problems now  front desk girls are very nice and good also only problem was ys attitude but we dont see him only dr d patel now  not long waits either excellent dr and very down to earth,0.0

i didnt quite realize how much i love thai cuisine until they closed for a few months to remodel their absence was deeply felt now that they are back in action the restaurant is better than ever it is now fully handicapped accessible with a bright clean new dining room and multiple bathroom stalls i was worried that the prices may increase due to the remodel but no they are the same the food also same if not improved the tom kha soup is as awesome as can be and our entrees were perfectly delicious they still feature a separate vegetarian menu to make ordering easy most anything on the vegetarian menu is or can be vegan just ask about egg  veg items do not contain fish sauce or shrimp paste and the service has always been excellent,1.0

we had a resvervation for a big party they made my friend sign a contract with credit card information to ensure the number of attendants and time of arrival we booked for 830pm arrived 15 min early but didnt have a table until 930pm they made us we waited for more than an hour and all of us were starving it was ridiculous that they asked us to arrive on time and they did not even have a table what is the point of making reservationfood is so so  pineapple was good and juicy but steaks were very salty and burnt inhouse service is horrible though the servers were slamming meat on my salad without even asking if i want it or not ps i had my card thingy on table showing red  meaning slow down no more food please  apparently servers dont care one of them even dropped pineapple on my napkin and ran awayhalfway through our dinner servers were cleaning up our table and asking if they can take the plates away one of them took my plate away and never replace a new one to me i had to go get a new plate at the salad bar myself and then i realized why they kept asking us if we are done or not because there were no more meat coming i didnt eat alot but i felt so bad for customers who came after us because their only food is the salad barthis is so far the worst restaurant experience i had in 2015 i had been to the same chain in niagara falls they had less meat selection but service was not as bad i am 100 sure i will not come back to this location ever again and will recommend smallbig parties not to hold events here  unless you want all your guests stuck at the entrance for over an hour and go home with empty stomachs,0.0

negative 5 stars  service is the absolute worst here when you arent korean if your are korean then you get your meats to the table fast and service is obviously better  i expect no service from asian restaurant im used to that  but this place is down right ridiculous  i always leave here mad and pissed off because the servers aggravated me  you order your meats in the 1st round and they try to tell you its too much and wont take anymore orders  even when its a party of 8they come by and grab the meat off the grill and just distribute it to whoever at the table even when its not even cooked yet  then they grab a used napkin from anyone sitting close by and scrapped the black gunk from the grill  wtasking for anything its like pulling teeth we asked 3 separate servers for hot tea finally got it after about half and hour they limit you two pieces of kalbi per person which is fine  but argues with you that you reached your limit and it suddenly changes to one per person when the menu states two pieces per person  im not going to cheat you out of an extra piece of kalbi peoplerelax  only thing i like about this place is that its 24 hours  the service and the aggregation i get here is not worth it  i rather starve  i seriously want to fight somebody when i dine here hahapoor service is one thing but they seriously piss you off here  you have been warneddont make me say i told you so,0.0
to start off i must confess i am a very difficult patient at the dentist office my anxiety level just at the thought of going is through the roof however the staff there was so extremely patient and showed that they truly cared and understood my anxiety i was able to get in as a new patient within a day or two and dr ngo did not just diagnose the problem and tell me to set another appointment which is what a lot of dental offices wouldve done he diagnosed the problem and took the time to fix it right then jan rocked   she completely understood my feelings and did everything humanly possibly to make things go smoothly for me dr ngo was so patient and understanding explaining ever step of the way what he was doing and that he understood how difficult this was for meim not saying i will not be as anxious when i go back but at least i know that they will understand and do whatever is needed to make me as comfortable as possible,0.0
i can appreciate how difficult it must be to create a menu but this place needs to work a little harder went here with 9 others and only 2 of the entrees and one side was average or above the other 7 entrees and multiple sides didnt get finished too many other better places in vegas dont waste your time on this hoping you pick one of the acceptable meals they get one star for effort and thats being generous,0.0

i found trudy through her instagram and was amazed by all the perfected eyebrows in the vast amount of real life before and after pictures there  despite her hefty price i contacted her in march 2016 and got myself appointment two months later  it took so long for her to reply back to me but when the time came to her taking my deposit that was not the case  that should have been the first red flag with her lack of communication but i still insisted to overlook that because i was so convinced from her instagram picturesi finally met her and got my eyebrows done  she appeared nice but nonchalant  i made sure i gave myself ample amount of time to show up ahead of time to not be late since her fine print emphasized on ones implications should one arrive late  the process was very straight forward and i was excited as heck to finally get eyebrows  my eyebrows didnt turn out completely the way that i had expected but trudy emphasized that the results are very individualized and vary depending on the natural shape of my brows fine i respected thatwhat really upset me is how unprofessional she is and the lack of a flying care for her customers after she gets your money  i emailed her on june to secure my first touchup appointment and she gave me her the next earliest available date is september and i gladly confirmed  i was on maternity leave while all this was happening and i returned back to work and had a conflict with the date  i emailed her immediately to request for a change in appointment date  she finally emailed me back saying that the next earliest appointment that she had was in september which pushes pass the 6 month point for touchup appointments and that it would cost me an additional 200 feei really wished that trudy treated her customers like real life humans instead of being so fixated on her advantageous rules to squeeze whatever she can out of the clients  this really upset me that she showed no flexibility or accommodation to work together with her customers to foster the long term relationships  i told her to cancel my appointment altogether as i rather lose my eyebrows than to ever give her another dollar of my money  i followed her aftercare instructions exactly and my eyebrows faded and empty patches as can be seen in her pictures  i would highly recommend that readers to consider looking at my uploaded pictures of the harsh reality that not everyones eyebrows would turn out beautiful as only shown on her ig account such as in my case that can be seen in my uploaded photos  save yourself the trouble and take your business to somebody else that would have more respect and care for their customers because trudy doesnt care beyond money,0.0

hubby and i just got back from vegas and we always stay at caesars palace  for some reason we had not tried raos so i made sure we checked it out this trip  it was one of the best italian resturats i have been to  it wasnt super busy when we got there so the staff was pretty attentive  i asked to have a table in the replica room when i originally made the reservations  it was awesome  i loved the old style look  it was a little dark but we used our phone flashlights when we needed to we started off with the mozzarella carrozza  they were like two giant fried cheese triangles  they were perfectly breaded and the mozzarella was rich and creamy  the marinara sauce was pretty tasty too  very fresh and flavorfulfor our entrees hubby had the veal parm and i had the penne vodka wmeatballs on the side  seriously the veal was huge  and bone in  it was so tender that hubby was cutting it with his fork  the penne was cooked to a perfect al dente and the vodka sauce was heavanly  i have become a big fan of vodka sauce so ive had it in a few resturants and this has to be one of the best if not the best  i thought it was pretty cool the way they presented it  the waiter came to the table and plated it from the pan that it was cooking in  the real star of the evening was the meatballs  they melted in your mouth like butter  we were actually taking slices off of them with our forks  we were so stuffed but i felt horrible having so much left over so we over ateagain  we didnt finish them but couldnt take them with us it was really a damn shame  no room for dessert this time which is shocking since i love sweets  i think next time well scale it back so we can try the cheesecake  hubby was very grateful that i set this up for us  we will definately return  cheers,1.0

this place use to have 5 stars and now it cant even deserve one star let me star by saying if you go out to eat at a restaurant you expect for everyone to get there food at the same time so you can eat together as a family not so you have to eat while someone in your party waits to get there food while everyone else eats cause at this point we are starving after waiting an hr for our food  keep in mind 2 adults and 3 children so my husband order steak and shrimp as soon as he gets his plate put down first thing he see is a big black hair in the mash potatoes we show the server the hair she grabs it say ill be rite back she walked toward her manager and the manager then takes the plate goes to the back doesnt come back till about 3 mins to tell us dont worry i took care of it im making you a new one walks away does not say sorry does not ask if we need anything at this point me and my husband are so fed up with the rudeness and the way they attend this situation its hair not nice to have on your food in a restaurant ten minutes pass and the steak is still not out at this point we want nothing and just want to leave are bill was 80 you tell me where the she took care of it part was  ridiculous olive garden had done way better job with managers apologies and come to the table rite away and talk to us and make you feel better  not this place i will never come here even if the have my favorite soup so upset of how they handle their situations like this and the manger should most defiantly not have this position ,0.0

updatefirestone went through my car with a fine tooth comb they identified the root cause of the issue and took ownership they made the necessary repairs and the car is running better than it has in years the manager is professional helpful and transparent i am once again a fan of firestone specifically this location philive been going to this location for several years they have always been professional timely and reasonably priced but my latest visit was a disappointing and surprising disaster i went in for an oil change and there was something wrong with the brakes the brakes were a surprise because the same location serviced them less than a year prior they showed me the new issue  the calipers had gone bad they fixed the new problem and replaced the parts from the previous service for free i was a happy customer until i picked up my car as soon as i turned the key i knew something was off the engine did not sound or feel right subtle but noticeable the car was sluggish during acceleration still it ran without significant issues so i took it hometwo days later i took my family on a road trip we were headed up a steep incline and all of a sudden we lost power and white smoke exploded out of our tailpipei took the car back explained the observations when i picked the car up and the performance during the road trip they were closing in 45 minutes so the manager said theyd look at it and have an answer the next morningthe next morning came with an 1100 estimate to fix the car the manager under the impression that only the brakes were repaired maintained that their service had nothing to do with the issues causing the performance and behavior i observed after i picked it upi disagreeif my car worked except for the brakes before i dropped it off you work on it for two days and theres a problem when i pick it up  you caused the problemim waiting on a response from their corporate office i hope they choose to take ownership of this,0.0

i had a great experience at elliot  co he ambiance reminds me of an old school barber shop with a modern flare the staff are friendly and attentive i was given a bottle of water while waiting for my turn at the chair i got my haircut from elliot the man himself he took the time to listen to what i wanted and executed well he is clearly a perfectionist as he took about an hour on my hair i dont mind as long as the outcome is in my favor he even used a hot towel on my head prior to doing my straight razor fade given the time and effort he expended on my hair he earned a good tip and a repeat customer im definitely coming back for another cut with elliot,1.0

this is a terrible company and buyer should beware they use a bait and switch model in which you rent the vehicle for a cheap price and when you get to the counter they do not have the model of vehicle you requested so you can pay to upgrade to another vehicle or wait hours for one to return the other option is to wait in their sister car rentals for hours to get your reservation honored we waited in line for over two hours the customer service is terrible and the manager on duty jim was a very mean individual we will never rent from this company as they are a complete scam,0.0

working with orlando and best in show has been one of the best things i could have done for my 1 year old doberman gesiah i found that gesiah would be walking me down the street and basically do whatever he wanted when he wanted i did my best trying to do my own obedience training by watching its me or the dog and the dog whisperer but i was not get consistent results like i wanted i found that playing fetch calling him to come when i wanted him eating his food with having to dress it up and going to the bathroom all over the yard was a battle after putting in a phone call to orlando at best in show he invited me to a few of his sessions i noticed that when i asked gesiah to do a command he would only do it if there was a treat involved or sometimes he would do nothing because he was out of his environment my goal was for him to be obedient on my terms not his i finally decided to leave gesiah with orlando in his home for 2 12 weeks orlando welcomed me to visit gesiah at anytime and to also see the progress that they had made after the 2 12 weeks with orlando gesiah walks by my side listens to my commands eats his food and has good manners thanks to orlando and the techniques he taught me his level of expertise enhanced my understanding and competency in working with my dog on his weaknesses as well as my own weaknesses as the pack leader i am very pleased with orlandos training methods and have witnessed an impressive change in my dogs behavior and attitude i strongly recommend orlandos services for both dog owner novices as well as those of you who consider yourselves fairly knowledgeable and competent theres always room to grow and orlandos experience can help you do just that the investment was well worth it and your services were greatly appreciated thank you orlando with warm regards sandra and the new and improved gesiah update 30914   gesiah is almost 6 years old and has maintained all of the training he was taught by orlando anytime i walk into a petsmart or a dog park im always complimented on his behavior and how well he listens even at home he does great when i get company at the door or when we go on walks orlando has been a blessing he has taught me so much but at the end of the day its about having a dog who listens well and behaves gesiah is very loving and gentle but most importantly he continues to be obedient once again thank you orlando aka best in show for doing such an amazing job,1.0

one of my least favorite places in the hood the establishment charges similar to an upscale bar but does not give an upscale experience service was basically non existent we werent served at all the bartender ended up coming to grab our orders because she felt bad for us when the food arrived it was really bad no one in our party of 8 enjoyed their food drinks were normal but took forever for us to order and get i dont recommend coming here there are too many other options around these streets,0.0
i came here a while ago and i was browsing for places on yelp for my next vegas trip so i thought id write a review about my experience while i was looking first off i got sick eating here that should be a red flag to people considering the place but it honestly could have what i ordered wanting to be cheap i got the roast beef sandwich the sandwich was served cold which was fine with me but it tasted very strongly of horseradish to the point where the store bought roast beef and veggies were sort of overpowered that was also fine i thought itd at least make the sandwich taste like something but not to long into my meal and i felt a strange gagging reflex and a rumbling in my tummy the meat seemed to have gone bad and it was very well masked by the aforementioned horseradish i spent the night with an upset stomach and a bit of heavingjust do yourself a favor when youre in vegas and choose your dining establishment with at least as much care as you would place on a table game,0.0

truly some of the best frozen yogurt i have ever had i dropped by on a saturday night and was surprised to how full the place was i went in and tried a couple of samples  sample cups were on the counter by the frozen yogurt and i just grabbed a couple of the small cups to try 12 flavors i wanted something fruity and something more creamy so i went with dulce de leche and pomegranate raspberry o m g the dulce the leche did not disappoint it was so delicious that i hope it sticks around for a while so i can keep going back and getting it toppingwise they have a great variety of toppings with different fruits chocolates including kit kats which i love chocolate chips nuts and sauces i will definitely be going back to try more of the flavors in the future,1.0
this has to be the worst customer service i have ever had  i had a recall on my airbag called 4 times and left messages and never got a return call  my wife called 2 more time and finally demanded to speak to someone  she was able to get the appt for the recall  later that week we realized we needed our state inspection  i called to add that to my appt and she said no problem and that it was added to the appt  the next week my wife takes the car to the appt and on her way the check engine light comes on  she gets there and they said that we didnt have an appt for a state inspection but they would try to squeeze it in  she was then told that we couldnt do a state inspection because of the check engine lightwhich we understand she then asked for them to figure out why it came on and fix it while we are here so we can do state inspection  they did a diagnostic test130ish but was told we would pay if they found something to fix  of course they didnt find anything that needed fix and just reprogrammed the computer system and told us to drive 100 miles before inspection  wouldnt you know it the next week the light comes back on and we take it back in  now this time they find an issue to fix but wont send it to our warranty company because they dont deal with them anymore they submitted to them last year when we had an issue they didnt feel the need to tell is this time  they also would not refund our diagnostic fee from last visit like they said they would  when my wife called to talk to the manager to discuss the situation he told her he wasted 10 minutes of his time listening to her berate him  he said he would talk to the service desk in the am to see what they discussed and call her back in the am  surprise surprise no call the next day then two days later she gets a text about a survey and that they strive for all 10s as a customer we would at least like a call back,0.0
this has become my standard for all sushi to be judged i have not had a bad item here rainbow carpaccio is a must try its sashimi of 4 or 5 different fish with a cucumber relish prices are moderate but with a free byob its easy to overlook that the tempura is light and prefectly crisp ive only had one noodle dish i think so i cant judge too well based on that but what i had was excellent service is always great,1.0
as someone who works for local espresso bar i really wanted to like this place but my experiences there are crappy enough that i will never return first off there is no rhyme or reason of where to order no sign line or anything just a random girl standing on her phone completely ignoring your presence if you try to walk to the opposite side of the bar where the menu actually is you can count on the male barista questioning you as if youve offended them oh and be sure not to ask about the blends or beans they will give you entilted replies as if youre stupid as someone who sincerely loves everything coffee culture i was hoping for some solidarity welcoming spirit or atleast fast or friendly service which all three times i got none of plus the wait time is absurd bc its never that busy unless you want a place to sit on your laptop allday and drink average coffee alone this place should be avoided i wish they had manager present for customers to talk to instead of having bad service repeatedly,0.0

little cleos  another spot that has been hovering on my foodie bucket list  since my heart actually does belong to bean town i am a bit of a seafood snob we were dining with another couple one of which was another native bostonian and bonafide seafood expert our collective love of most anything from the ocean lead us to little cleos  we were celebrating and wanted to ensure we could get seated so we opted for a last minute reservation i was skeptical that we would be able to secure a spot so last minute no problem there the table we were led to was tucked away in the back of the restaurant making it cozy and as secluded as possible for this busy little gem of a placestaff so incredibly nice friendly smiling looked genuinely happy to be interacting with us in addition to food i am also passionate about fashion  the young woman who greeted and seated us was wearing a bright summer fruit printed dress that made me smile a nice change from uniform restaurant garb  our server was awesome  she new the menu intimately and helped us all weigh our choices in a practical informed fashionambiance love the open concept and blending of venues i had plenty to look at but not in an overstimulating way maybe a decibel too loud yet since we were in a corner it helped keep sounds muted enough where we could have an audible conversationfood  definitely above average for this seafood lover again i have been spoiled by some of the best seafood in the nation az not really on the leader board in this category  the toast was a hit especially when dipped in the butter from the crab legs jar  decadent artery clogging gut busting but worth it  friend in a posted picture had the oysters and octopus as well as the shrimp poor boy he raved about all three fish and chips  worth the bath in hot oil necessary for this staple  i had the crab legs in a jar  warm and succulent crab yummy yum yum the last dish to review was a disappointment  cajun shrimp with corn and potatoes  shrimp were rock hard like the first time i boiled shrimp without instruction the cajun spice was good but not greatbummer they were out of lemon icebox cake i was saving room for  prices well it is seafood after allfish dont swim in the dessert,1.0
my gf stayed in the augustus tower 32nd floor in room 3295 during sema week 2017 perfect quiet room away from the elevator with a spa tub as requested got my mandatory bubble bath the room was spacious with a king bed and seating area bathroom was huge with dual vanity private toilet with a separate door inside the bathroom and a glass enclosed shower loved that there was a security camera right outside of the room view was not that great but it didnt matter as we were not in the room much plus side is its left of lobby and you pass starbucks going to and from the elevators self check in was a breeze augustus tower rooms are definitely nicer and more spacious than the julius rooms which are more basic i stayed in a julius room with coworkers before she arrived and it was not as nice but still more than sufficient no tub though only a shower,1.0
you can always judge a place by how busy it is if youre reading a review from someone saying  i dont know what all the hype is about well if there were any truth to that then the place would not be packed full of customers almost from opening to closing timei have tried a lot of different food items here i can say that almost everything was much better than average my favourites are the apple fritters and huge cold cut sandwiches custom ordered sfogliatelle cake is the best in toronto and if you dont know what this isi suggest you order one it is pronounced  sfoya tellayes some days you may get a food item that wasnt as good as the last time this is based on a constellation of factors  but then you go back again and it was better then the first timei am italian and i have been to almost every italian bakery in toronto  my opinion by far that this bakery is the bestand whomever compared their donuts to tim hortons must have lost their sense of smell and taste  people dont line up and take numbers to buy tim hortons donuts  one day i was placing an order and three different customers kept interrupting asking if there were any apple fritters left,0.0

the place looks nice ambience is good but the staff and food is worse we ordered some food and a mango lassi  totalled upto some 87 which already had an additional surchargeso here is where they are bad the mango lassi was just mango puree with water when i said that this doesnt taste like make lassi just after a sip as there was no yogurt in it and it was very thin in consistency i was given a lecture n argument that this how its been made for 16 years so i told them to please take it back as i dont like it n they did looking at me in rage then they brought us the food which first of all is like not worth the money coz there is no justifiable quality or quantity plus to take revenge the staff added so much red chilli powder on top that we had stomach burns right from the very first bite so requested them to change it n they said it will still be charged n to taunt us one of thier other servers kept commenting i hope you are enjoying the food when u can taste the difference that whether the food is cooked with or has chilli powder added just on top its not at all good for indian people as you would straight away know how they are fooling peoplewill never go back there even if i was given free food,0.0

this was an amazing restaurant and definitely a little hidden downtown spot we found this place while searching for somewhere to eat before the hornets game and we were so glad we found it an easy walk from our hotel about 20 blocks away and easy to find the service was exceptional and the food was even better we started with fried pickle chips for the appetizer and they were amazing then my fianc selected the melt for the burger he wantedhe described it as the best burger he has ever put in his mouth thats saying something folks we both got sides of mac and cheese and it was the most interesting mac and cheese i have ever ate there was the traditional cheese flavor but there were also flavored of garlic and parmesan which made it even better after dinner i was almost tempted to get the velvet which was fried ice cream served with red velvet cake and chocolate syrup or somethingi was distracted by the fact that there was fried ice cream and red velvet cake together fortunately for our bodies we didnt get that but next time i will need to not get food and just get dessert this place is definitely one you should check out and enjoy the wonderful atmosphere crazy music videos and the fantastic food,1.0

i recently ate there and really the burger was pretty good but what ruined it was the girl that was taking the orders behind the counter handling the money and then going out and smoking  a cigarette between taking orders right outside the door where everyone could see her and then coming back in and serving  the food without washing her hands it was noticed by several others she also had a friend boy hanging out at the counter visiting while we were there and he wasnt eating just taking up a spot it was distasteful to say the least im sure the health dept would shut it down if they witness this,0.0

im wondering if the living room is transitioning to a self service restaurant i get it sometimes the stars deliver a most eminent ass whooping upon servers who are just trying to keep it together sadly thats not the case with the living room ive been in 3 seperate times recently all of which the restaurant was seemingly empty yet the servers whom i can only assume are named regina gretchen and karen couldnt find time between gossiping to get to our tables after attempting to give this place one more try 3 times i and most likely many others will never again get my hopes up only to be met by the cold boney shoulders of their unimpressed waitresses waitresses who look down upon my money and i and think you cant sit with us i feel genuinely sorry for the owners who have simultaneously created such a beautiful atmosphere  and seriously horrible staff one which could easily put them out of business,0.0

lets start at the beginning a few years back mortuarys last year open we decided to check out as many haunted houses as possible in las vegas we started with 13th floor at circus circusgood for small children then we went to the fright dome okay but i though wow i am getting old got a few screams and startles out of me the general area had people that startled me more than the attractions themselves the we went to the trilogy of terror  omg best night ever went on a thursday and felt as if we were the haunts targeted victim we ended up meeting the father son team that created trilogy of terror because they had concerns for my boyfriend who walks with a cane going through the haunts nicest guys ever  we went to about 6 more haunts in las vegas and on halloween weekend ended up back at trilogy of terror the next year mortuary was taken down and gates of hell was open not to give anything away but there was a part where the  floor your standing on drops about an inch i screamed so loud and my new thing i do laugh when i am nervous started laughing uncontrollably that the terroristcast member asked if i was alright we have already gone once with friends this year when we got there this year you are greeted by people who take your picture in front of a green screen my first thought was just another way to make money well i have to say i was impressed with there pictures and the pricing  in fact we ended up purchasing 4 pictures so everyone in our party could have one if you can only go to one place this year for your haunting experience this should be the place great for little and big kids we took a 12 year old with us this year and while the other adults went into the gates of hell he didnt feel left out because we went and got him a picture so frickin coolwe dont even try the other haunts anymore this is as good as it gets,1.0

terrible company overall the only good news so far on day 5 from getting my car back transmission seems to be fixed i am one to hardly ever complain however the 4 weeks that my car was at cofc was a disaster during the first two weeks of my car being there and some poor communication on where my car stood in getting completed we were given several stories of parts being lost drilled into wrong angry employees leaving and possibly sabotaging parts an employee leaving on his deathbed due to cancer and day after day being told it will only be another day or two until it was ready we lost faith after the first two weeks with this local shop only for the nonsense to continue with the gmmr jody preston when we brought our concerns and wanted a significant discount needless to say once we shared our concerns we were laughed at when asking for a discount made to feel ignorant and even were bullied when gm declared that he was wondering if we even had the money to pay to get the car back during the last conversation we had with gm he hung up on us blatantly making us aware that this company and owner fred bowen do not care for its customers after a lot of work was done on our end the only discount that the gm and customer service rep agreed upon was to reimburse for half of the rental car rate we ensued customer service rep listened to our concerns over 45 minutes and agreed that our story sounds terrible and just bad however the final say was up to the gm and the owner will probably back up his gms i highly recommend not using this shop for your car care needs,0.0
me and my friend had reservations here and shot rifles here and the experience was beyond amazing they have a wide selection of guns to choose from in different packages our instructor chris was not only instructive but very informational professional and extremely motivated which made me motivated because of him i will be coming back in the future the setup inside was very cool customer service at the desk was excellent id say the only downside is that ammo is very pricey for how much they give you see their website for rates so be prepared to spend other than that this is definitely a thing to do on the strip if you love guns,1.0
most amazing florist ever i use paradise valley florist for every occasionholiday and every single time my wife calls bragging about how jealous everyone is about her flowers everything can be done online and they have so many designs to chose from to make the process easy the hardest part i think is deciding between all the gorgeous arrangements ive also called in with questions and suki is always very helpful she makes sure you get exactly what you have in mind and she will make you look good and yes the upgrade options are definitely worth it also i appreciate the delivery driver too he wont hesitate to call if any question needs answered or specific direction needs given it gives me a sense of relief knowing he wants to make sure every delivery is perfect thank you so much suki to you and your entire team happy wife happy life,1.0

ive been here 4 times the first 3 visits were ok but the last one is totally a let downwe waited to be seated for more than 15 minutes and we were ignored by the servers waiters were walking past us and none of them decided to stop or call their receptionist  we were dressed nicely we were not dressed like a homeless person so i dont know why we were ignoredanyways the first three that we went there the food was ok the pasta and calamari are good but i hope they do something about their service,0.0
first it must be understood that this is a review for the tempe location which is pretty much in the southern tip of scottsdale but that isnt here and it isnt there either that has been newly remodeled i will not speak in length of the old dcor as it has no more relevance to the epitome of swank that is the new look at green i wont talk about the recycled material art that lined the south wall that included lightly painted utensil drawer organizers and vw hubcaps i also wont talk about the slightly preachy overly optimistic quote that wrapped the wall through the corner near the restrooms written in a fun script only an undergrad girl studying design theory and armed with a paint brush could achieve i also wont mention the antique piano up against the dividing wall that in spirit only begged one thing of whoever laid eyes on it its modest demand was to be played in a manner worthy of the saloons that once occupied the desert space where green now lies yet the only text on the instrument was a small sign written with a marker saying  please do not play piano i also wont talk about the loooooong table going from front door to register that on busy nights youd get stuck sitting at with two of your friends only to have your back brushed against by numerous vegetarian butts that graze only on accident and rarely warrant an apology but still   no buns on the back please  i will however mention their new patio that has arrived just in time for the cold season when dining on said patio will surely manifest in me a tension worthy of hitchcocks direction between enjoying sweater weather with solely my hot entre or hitting the tipping point of finger numbing cold with my seemingly mandatory postdinner tsoynami the caged in effect achieved by the patio might be resonant to that of a human cage which to give credit to the designer might be the intent the subtext of the patio may read something to the effect of peter signers breakthrough work animal liberation eliciting the contradictory feeling of being outside and feeling claustrophobic and caged in thus allowing the patron to empathize with the plight of factory farmed animals and subsequently prompting the euphoric smugness that comes from the knowledge that no animals were harmed or exploited in making that mock steak poboy except maybe the dudes in the kitchen scraping by for minimum wage the vintage car doors are still in effect over freshly vinyled booths that safely seat four but typically six partially due to their limited seating and mostly due to the nearly miniature size of the average patron who tend to be slight frail and eager to show they dont mind a little contact the alternative girl vibe that exudes from the front of the house staff meshes well with the obvious southwestern conventionality of the kitchen staff a powerclash in true form if you disregard their postjuno fashion choices you see some of the nicest undertipped funny people in the local service industry calling in an order is as easy as vegan pie and pretty swift too ive frequented this location for 5 years and dont intend to stop anytime soon the secret bbq chicken sandwich is at the top of the charts but if not that then the argentine poboy is a fine choice as well hands down one of my favorite places in the valleyheres a tip dont be a dummy add chai to your tsoynamii have no idea how the kitchen staff is compensated,0.0
best pizza in clevelandi came here with some friends for the first time  we each ordered a different pizza and all tried pieces from each others each one was better than the last  my favorite was the verde white pizza with spinach italian sausage green onions and crushed pistachios  this is true italian style pizza which is very thin and light so youre probably going to want to eat a whole pizza  one minor issue is that the pizza oven can only make a couple of pizzas at a time so if you go in a group your pies might come out at different times  however this issue is quickly forgotten about when you realize how delicious the pizza is  you can tell a lot of thought and expertise went into designing each of the pizzas on the menu  the ingredients and the dough were fresh and the pizzas had so much flavorthe restaurant is tiny but the atmosphere is cozy and stylish  no they dont serve free glasses of water but i get it  this is a new place that took a chance on the neighborhood and theyre trying to make it work 30000 pizza ovens imported from italy take awhile to pay off  im looking forward to coming back and sampling the other pizzas hopefully theyll rotate the menu and have some seasonal specialties,1.0
george does makes some good donuts i still prefer jack frost above all my friend at work brought some in today he said the hours are super early and you need to arrive early why dont people bring healthy snacks to work it is never fruit or vegetable trays is this self destructive behavior the result of being trapped in a building during the daylight hours or are these attempts to thin the heard and ensure that the weaker and sicker people die off thus allowing job security during lay offs and budget trimming i dont know what it is i know that these donuts are good as can be though,0.0
i love dr alamo  my husband and i have been patients for years and have always received the best care from him  there may be a wait from time to time but id rather have a wait for an excellent doctor than be seen quickly by a terrible one  he takes the time to listen to concerns and hes all for a conservative approach  if youre looking for a pain pill fix  hes not the doctor for you  if youre looking for a doctor that is going to give you quality care and expects you to be a part of the solution  hes the tops,1.0

good daythank you for reading my post  tacos 101 did not deliver at all on their tacos  i was looking forward to eating at the restaurant considering all of the positive poststhe service ambience were pleasurable for how small the business isthe tacos were extremely small and not hot or tasty whatsoever  i was expecting a better product and experience  the size of the tacos are appetizer size so make sure you order a few to satiate yourself govern yourself accordingly taco bell is open and available for mexican food,1.0
sunday night my sister flew in from canada she wanted some authentic mexican cuisine so i brought her to carlsbad we were served by jeff who explained that the food is actually new mexican cuisine they use peppers in nearly every dish from hatch peppers to habanero and everything in between jeff mentioned that he was new to the restaurant and imediately i thought oh no i thought our service would be slow but he really changed my mind quickly he was very knowledgable about most everything and he really did an amazing job making is laugh he suggested the brochettes and potstickers for appetizers which were very good we also ordered the pasta dish with chipotle chicken as suggested it was amazingly flavorful overall i would give our service and the meal 10 stars if i could,1.0
i had an opportunity to dine with some close friends while in town which was only topped by this mealwhere do i begin to explain  first let me describe the service they were beyond friendly but not in a bad way they were extremely attentive to every detailas an example my friend has a serous gluten intolerance and the server made sure she knew which items contained gluten or a gluten binder but wait for it they actually asked the kitchen to not use the binders on the mushrooms and brought out gluten free breadnow thats service next our meal we all each had the 35 day aged australian filet it was cut with a fork tenderwe enjoyed the beets baked alaskan and a delicious concoction of mushrooms and gravyi am so impressed that the memory of it will last for a very long timebring your favorite persons and go celebrate food,1.0
wow the place is pretty but dont expect high end as they tout on their website  its basically timbers with much better atmosphere we joked from the start that our waitress hated us but it became clear that it wasnt a joke she actually did hate us or maybe just her job were pretty happy golucky so we can handle a hard attitude she reminded me of my bff i actually texted my bff and said she should never be a server lol we laughed it off we werent here for her company anyway to bad the food was terrible we had the potstickers which were the best dish despite being a bit on the spicy side artichoke dip excited to see it come w crostini but surprisingly the chips were way better than the bread the dip itself was soso and i had the fish and chips which were very bland but the fish was better the next day in the toaster i hardly touched the tastless fries which was a big part of why i ordered fish n chips to begin with then we made the huge mistake of ordering dessert  we wanted it togo but were told we couldnt get 2 out of 3 desserts togo due to the fact they are served in mason jars this is crazy to me i get it its hipster cool but ive had other restaurants that do it that way know how to send their creations togo i asked if they could just pour it into a togo container and that i wouldnt hold it against the chef i mean it couldnt be worse than dinner right so we ordered the chocolate cream pie and chocolate chip cookies  we had already paid our bill and were just waiting on desserts after 10 minutes our server walked by and said have a good night we reminded her we were waiting on dessert oh right let me go check on that she came back and told us the cookies are baked to order so they take a bit anyone whos ever baked cookies knows they take 12 mins tops and anyone whos ever worked in a restaurant that had a madetoorder dessert also knows to mention the wait time to the customer at some pointafter 20 minutes so tried to get her attention to ask about dessert to which she snapped back across the section sir thecookiesaremadetoorderafter 30 minutes we got our desserts the chocolate cream pie is pudding with whipped cream and crumbled grahams although the kitchen did know how to make it to go very nicely packaged in a soup container the chocolate chip cookies were good 4 thin cookies fresh from the oven probably take about 7 minutes to bake80 for 2 beers 3 apps 1 main 2 dessertsunrealbetter off throwing another 30 to that and going to the melting pot for a fine dining experience where the staff treat you well and the chef aims to please,0.0

called to get a quotation for audi q5 brake replacement  craig told me that they can only quote  upon physically inspecting the car  thought it was unusual but trusted good yelp reviews i interpreted it positively  perhaps the shop pays attention to details when arrived craig came out and asked some info  provided all and expected he would start checking the required parts and provide a quotation  but instead he asked me to leave the key and wait  it was getting little awkwarddrove 30 mins and wait 45 mins just to get a quote  when i complained the attitude craig showed me was indeed unprofessional  not sure if it is this person or the general attitude of the shopin any case they should definitely learn what customer oriented means  what a waste of time and energy,0.0

my friend and i decided to eat here for lunch recently after reading the good reviews on yelp we were not disappointed when we first arrived they were giving out samples of the caramel sea salt milkshake freakin amazing i would have ordered one but even though i love milkshakes they dont always love me back i ordered the greek lamb burger it comes medium rare which i was fine with i also wanted to mention that i ordered a gluten free bun which by the way they make in house very tasty really quite delicious not dry and cardboard tasting like udis my friend got the buffalo bill bison burger and he liked it a lot we split a large fries and although they informed us in advance that that the fries would come out first i found that a bit odd but no points off for that since we ate all of them and they were pretty decent fries their sodas are quite unique by maine root i opted for the prickly pear lemonade soda very sweet no high fructose corn syrup in these babies my friend got the mexicane cola and he enjoyed it overall it was a very good experience and we would definitely return,1.0
my husband and i were driving from warren to kent and wanted to have a good lunch along the way  we were not disappointed  i ordered the james harrison and my husband had the arsenio hall  the james harrison was ridiculously amazing  the caramelized onions were cooked perfectly  with the bbq sauce mayo cheese and onion ring i thought it might be too much but it was delicious  my husband said his arsenio hall was also great  they even had ice cream but we were too full to try it out  unfortunately i wont be able to come here more often since i live in texas  i highly recommend this restaurant,1.0

oh man this place has great large rooms which are really villas with kitchen whirlpool etc it ends there if i could give negative stars i wouldthe customer service is beyond horrible1 they did not write down the internet access information when we checked in so i tried to call the front desk and was placed on hold for 17 minutes before finally giving up my husband then walked to the front desk to get the information and was told that it was written on his card packet at checkin it wasnt but they told him it was a disaster at the desk there was a long line and that he had to go back and check the card packet he came back to the room to get it to show them nothing was written so they finally wrote down the info barely apologized and while my husband was standing there another man came in furious about being on hold on his phone for so long an hour later we finally were able to use internet but only one device at a time2 in order to use the free shuttle which only runs once per hour you have to sign up fine but when we called the front desk to register we were told that you must sign up in person so even sitting on the phone giving them a specific time doesnt work had to walk over there again to deal with their ridiculously poor service3 our key cards kept not working on the outside fence we had to go get new keys three times and still they would stop working there is no way to prop the gate open except to put a piece of furniture or luggage in it so frustrating to get locked out every other time 4 our room was poorly serviced they sloppily made the sleeper bed but not the regular bed and didnt replace all of the towels the ceiling is paper thin and it sounded like our upstairs neighbors were moving furniture all the time5 when my husband told the manager he had several issues she was very indifferent and said he was welcome to come and talk to her  but that she was the only one at the desk at the time so in other words later6 our main issue we had a small trailer that we were traveling with that easily fits in a standard parking space and were told that it is against their policy to have any type of trailer on the property however there was a uhaul trailer sitting outside all weekend  we had a two room villa with 7 people that easily justifies two parking spaces but were forced to park it across the street in their unguarded lot then told that they had no liability for it part of the reason for booking this property is the guarded entry but now our trailer is unprotected it does not state this policy on the booking sites we woke up the second morning to a graffiti tag on it had to make a police report and westgate just repeated their no trailer policy and said they were sorry and their guard had been watching it reallyif you are considering this hotel dont you will be sorry weve stayed in hotels literally across the globe and this was hands down one of the worst experiences,0.0

i love brueggers but this location is a fail  the blonde woman working behind the counter has a scowl so deeply imbeded on her face that i felt like i was imposing on her when i placed my order she also doesnt cut your bagel or wrap for you so be prepared to grab a knife to take back to the office  service is so slow that ive seen people walk out numerous times after standing in line  the quality of the breakfast items is not up to par with other locations  the eggs taste like mcdonalds food prepared half assed and the bagels are often stale  go to dunkin next door or walk the extra few blocks and go to a different location,0.0
from our inital visit to inquire about services to well after the conclusion of our anniversary lunch the service at joey yorkdale was exceptional  nathalie worked with us on every detail from specific drink requests such as holding bottles to offering childfriendly menu options  even when our guest list fluctuated staff were at the ready and everyone was friendly approachable and utterly professional  our guest list o 35 friends and family couldnt say anything negative about the experience service ambiance and food  staff were so courteous that the general manager pulled us aside to mention that the waitresses had a moral dilemma in which they felt that they were being overtipped we as the hosts were covering the gratuity desserts and drinks for our guests while they covered their entrees thus creating a possibility where they received additional tips  their concern was a pleasant surprise as this type of attitude is typically nonexistent elsewhere my partner and i couldnt be happier with how the event unfolded  we along with many of our guests would be happy to return as repeat dinersyou have excellent staff at this location  they deserve recognition for their outstanding work ethic as they showcase exactly what quality customer service is all aboutthanks for making our anniversary memorable,1.0

i think it is ridiculous that there are so many bad reviews ive lived here for a few months and i have yet to have a problem when i first moved in there were a few things that needed to be fixed and as soon as i put in the order they were out there the following day my neighbors are quite except my upstairs neighbor i think she is an elephant with cement flipflops but thats not the apartments fault the office is open extended hours and they have a convenient online portal for paying rent and putting in maintenance requests also instead of fedex or ups delivering packages to your doors the office expects them and holds them for you and even sends you a notification which some apartments will not even take the package for you if you are looking for a nice apartment complex with a cute little dog park this is it ignore the people that obviously are upset at the apartment complex for things they cant always control people usually only review when they are upset  also ps the photos that people post below how the hell is the office supposed to stop someone from double parking lol like there is a parking lot monitor all they can do is correct the issue once they are notified,0.0

this korean bbq place is a unique experience  from when you walk in the dishes that are served the pull down hood system and the staff it was a great experience  we were seating and the coals were on  shortly after traditional korean appetizersside dishes were served except there were a few that i havent seen in most korean places such as the bean sprouts and green onion salad yum  also hobak has their own sauce that includes onions and jalapenosthis is not an all you can eat place but that is more than okay  why  because you can actually take what you didnt finish home  i was super stuffedmy bro and i got the beef combo  this comes with beef brisket angus boneless short ribs hobak marinated skirt steak bean paste stew steamed egg and rice pop ice cream the servers cook for you  which is great because they did a better job cooking than i usually do  we started with the brisket on the grill  the server brought some sushi rice with a piece of wasabi in the middle  when the brisket was done he took a piece of the brisket put it on top of the sushi rice told me to dip it with their hobak sauce and i had a few more of those after  the brisket with the wasabi sushi rice and hobak sauce was amazingafter the brisket was done our server changed our grill and it was on to the mesh grill  again im glad hes cooking because i wouldnt how to handle cooking on this mesh grill  especially when i watched him cook our food the fire was blazing  after he cooked both sides he sliced the big slab of meat to many pieces  great with the hobak sauce or the side of salt and sesame oil  the hobak marinated skirt steak was the best  no need for sauces for that  we were getting stuffed at that point and had a bunch of leftovers so we got those to go  mix the steam egg with rice and you got a great combo  i couldnt get enough of the bean paste stew  it was spicy and full of great flavorat this point i was so stuffed but i somehow always have room for desert  we got the rice pop green tea ice cream  it was very easy to eat ice cream sandwich  an ice cream sandwich where the rice pop outer layer tastes like a waffle cone  again i was stuffed but it was so good i devoured the whole thing,1.0

service is absolutely horrible i cant emphasize that enough like many indian restaurants the restaurant has lousy service and appears understaffed in my opinion there was no hostess we waited 10 minutes before anyone greeted us  once we were seated no one greeted us and just kept passing by us yeah i mean no one took our drink order finally we had to flag a waiter and yell at them that no one even approached our table only then did they stop to even take an order the water at the tables is lukewarm the bottle they are in appeared dirty for as nice as the restaurant appeared in terms of decor they really should invest in a hostess and about 3 more waiters and teach them basic service etiquettethe food is decent in my opinion its good but nothing noteworthy ive had better indian chinese in other parts of the valley if the service was better i would have considered back here but with the lousy service i dont recommend dining here if you are go to dine i recommend a few things bring bottles of cold water based on my experience i think there is a good chance your water and drinks will not be refilled our water was never refilled not once also any drink they bring you will be served lukewarm asking for ice was like asking for gold its a rare commodity here in my opinion and when they brought ice in drinks there was hardly any in the glass dress lightly and bring some hand held fans the restaurant was very warm and the ventilation was poor imho this was winter i hate to imagine what its like in the summer here arrive here with the mentality that you are in russia circa 1980s expect long waits maybe have a few alcoholic drinks prior to arriving here to mellow you out cuz you will be frustrated,0.0

my wife and i are creatures of comfort  our breakfast options usually consist of either egg works babystacks or burritos at robertos  we were out and about last weekend and had a hankering for some waffles  straightforward enough but surprisingly hard to find  this place pops up on yelp so we give it a godaaaang  the service was phenomenal  our waitress was on the ball making sure our coffee was topped off and that we had anything we could possibly want  the lavazza coffee was ok though not as mindblowing as i would have thought from hearing people talk about it  its no douwe egberts thats for sure  my wife got the nutella latte which was ludicrously deliciousthe waffle and cinnamon french toast were fantastic  do not miss out on the pot of bread with a side of some outrageously addicting sugary dipping substance that should probably be outlawedi sure wish this place wasnt so far from where we are in henderson  its a heck of a trek  also be aware that this location does not feature all of the items pictured on the menu  i would have loved to have tried the oreo butterscotch pancakes but that will require a trip to the other location,0.0
beware of kevin kendall owner of fearless motorsports i purchased a 2009 dodge journey sxt awd paid in full kevin issues a verbal 100 guarantee on engine and transmission for 1 month or 1500 miles engine light comes on 25 miles after purchase kevin continues with lies and more stories and made up figures of costs and his own spin on customer service which kevin doesnt understand the concept if kevins lips are moving then hes lying factual information car has a carfax report shows no accidents and mileage from 4 previous owners and shop repairs kevin reported this car with the exact mileage as from the time he purchased the vehicle at 121489 and almost three months later during sale to me posted the mileage at 121489 he reported the vehicle as a personal purchase yet sold it through fearless motorsports illegal maybe tax evasion probably shady definitely took car to auto body facility certified mechanic states front end clearly in a minor to major collision with possible frame damage easily verifiable with a replacement head lamp assembly with junkyard markings clearly written on the top of outer headlamp when asking kevin about headlamp being hazy his response was it was buffing compound from the detailer and itll come right off after original purchase of almost 5800 cash vehicle still cannot pass state of nevada emissions laws and engine light still on kevin agreed to paying for repairs to fix emissions and catalytic converter i had repairs done wholesale for just under 1000 total kevin says he called 2 fairy tale competitors and they quoted him over the phone of 330 catalytic converter alone was 590 wholesale and the labor is 4 hours plus 2 o2 sensors and a state certified mandated mechanic vehicle aslo needsbrakes rotors hub replacement motor mounts completely worn bearings and shocks and struts are completely worn out does this make sense to you well it makes sense to him so he offered an insulting 300 on his end on a vehicle that is under warranty the warrantynot an actual warranty but implied warranty on contract before purchase all of this will eventually end up in court so beware absolutely everything kevin kendall says or does is most likely a lie he is an out of control conartist scammer that probably should get anger management counselling as he gets released from a prison do yourself the biggest favor in the entire world run as fast and as far away as you can from kevin kendall and fearless motorsports llc read all of the reviews and i bet you can spot the fake ones from the real ones also look at the business responses all laughable and kevin kendall puts his own little spin on each and every one of them while reading keep in mind the reviews are from honest people needing to buy a large purchase from someone they hope is honest and reputable you can contact me im real and im out almost 8000 already north las vegas police report better business bureau and the arizona attorney general have all the forwarded documents,0.0

i have gone here two times i thought the first was just a bad daynope tried it again and the sound was so horrible i have better sound at my apartment the food is way over priced and the seating is so uncomfortable and weird i paid money to sit in an office chair and have a desk with lights that dont to out distracting me the whole time speaking of distracting the constant sound of people clinking their glasses and silverware is rather annoying and it just so happens alot of elderly people go here and for some reason they like to talk and talk the whoooollllleee time even after asking them to please be quietnot the theatres fault i know but its a reoccurring situation and i think they ahould have stricter rules on talking so all in all i will never go here again and would not recommend it unless you like to pay money for something you can do at home for free,0.0

avoid avoid avoidwe came to this place after seeing an ad for a meet and greet with ufc fighters the ad also said to contact them for reservations naturally we assumed this meant that to get to see the fighters you would need to be a patron so we booked a reservation and showed up on time the fighters however did not they showed up an hour late and when they did arrive this place became a circusthere was no organization whatsoever we asked our waiter if it was possible to meet the fighters as we were dining in the restaurant for that purpose and he said they dont tell me anything about whats going on and walked away when we got up and tried to get closer we were told to get in line if we wanted a pictureso why did we make the reservation as the ad suggested and spend  dining there if were supposed to line up behind nearly 100 people who werent patrons eventually we did manage to get some pictures since the process was such a mess that they couldnt really stop anyone dining in the restaurant from doing so but i feel really bad for the people who waited hours in line most of whom were waiting in 40 degree weather to meet fighters that showed up an hour late  further delays because people that i assume are friends of the restaurant owners or something got to skip the line to meet the fightersto make matters worse the burger i had was not cooked properly i ordered it mediumwell but received it welldone and charred the fries were great  at least they have that going for themwhile i wanted to order dessert the experience left such a poor taste in my mouth that i no longer wanted to contribute to these guys and will definitely avoid them in the future,0.0
when looking for a new car its hard to know who to trust rightthats how i feltearnhardt kia was the 3rd lot i visited in a two day period   needless to say the other two didnt get my business  so i drove over 30 miles to check out earnhardt kia because of the reviews quality of vehicles and warranties and the fact they are part of the largest dealership in the state  instead of being treated like a number when i arrived at earnhardt kia i was welcomed by antwon wallace a transplant from their las vegas storehe was friendly and easy going  i was apprehensive going into this experience because the other two dealerships  so i told him right off the bat i was here to build credit and instead of the light leaving his eyes he nodded his head and started showing me around before running my credit  i figured i was going to buy a used car but when he heard i needed a big backseat for my kids car seats he told me he had kids too and said he wanted to try to get me into a new sorento because of the rebates and warrantiesafter going on a test drive he talked to his boss and they worked out a deal for me that was waaaayyyy better than the deals i was offered at the other two stores and one was an auto mall and more than that i felt like i mattered  i felt they made me a very fair offer and that antwon was working for me at one point the owner of the dealership came by and shook my hand and gave me his personal cell number and said to call him if i had any issues  and when he told me how every one of his customers matter to him i truly felt he meant it amazing service all the way around  micheal the business manager that set up the loan was great as well  it was an awesome experience  i highly recommend you check out earnhardt kia before going with another dealership  they could be able to provide you better better piece of mind better service and possibly a better deal like they did for mei would call and ask for antwon wallace because he was the key for my awesome deal and the warranty they gave me is so sweet  mine includes free oil changes detailing of the car and upkeep on the paint job by spraying a gloss coat on my car regularly  can you believe it yup all includedyou gotta check them out remember to ask for antwon because the right sale person can always make you the right dealhappy car shoppingjewels,1.0

disappointing  a nice hotel with great ammenities  however slow elevators understaffed poor service and you do not get what you pay for moorea pool was a nice pool however it took forever to get drinks food salads and it wasnt even a busy weekend  took a half hour to get salad dressing so i could eat my salad that got hot by the time it arrivedactually i had to find a manager to get it for me because my waiter never came back  i expect better service and better management solutions when things go wrong at a hotel  when you pay top dollar for service i expect to get it the holiday inn express has better service than this hotel  after we checked out 2 people in our party had to call back to fix their over charging at the pool and for the hotel room  so even more time wasted on the phone after we left to get that taken care of which still took several phone calls to get it resolved and waiting on hold for 30 minutes before someone would answeroverall i would stay somewhere else  ps  when this hotel says that you are getting a king bed you are actually getting a queen bed  when they say you are getting a queen bed you are actually getting a double bed  not sure why they need to falsely advertise your bed size but it does make a difference when you plan to have people share a double bed gets a little more cozy than desired  the palms hotel does the same thing  if the vegas standard is smaller than real life then why dont they just say it,0.0

although my time here was very brief i have just recieved a fantastic first impression of this place i stopped here because it was on the way home quite close actually and i needed gas their prices were lower than i saw at any other gas station driving home from 43rd and peoria so that says something their lot is very nice and spacious enough for me to easily drive around and to find a pump i had my niece and nephew in the car sleeping so i did not want to wake them up just to go inside and pay for gas i ran inside and the cashier could tell that i was in a hurry so he wasted no time in helping me i ran back outside and started pumping the gas which was my favorite partat almost every other gas station the gas pumps very slowly and i have to wait forever out in the heat also when it is close to the amount that you paid for it slows down even more and takes forever just to pump the last 50 cents when i pumped at this qt the ten dollars i put in pumped in less than 20 seconds and didnt slow down at all i was very impressed when i got into the car i could tell that this gas is better than anywhere else because it filled my tank up higher than 10 dollars filled it up anywhere else i also noticed from my short trip inside that they take care of the place very nicely because it is very clean this location has impressed me immensely and i will be back many more times to come,1.0

i have been going to pita jungle since their original location opened which is located on apache boulevard i have never ever had a bad meal there their servings are generous the prices are very decent for the quality of the food and the freshness of it and if you have not been there for happy hour which is incredibly inexpensive you really should try almost all the plates are between 1 and 3 and three or four will be very filling i go there at least once a month and i cannot recommend the chicken shawarma pita sandwich enough staff is friendly and very attentive and while the location is not perfect because you look at a parking lot or southern avenue if youre sitting outside at least they do have comfortable outside seating with sprinklers in the summer and heaters in the winter overall if you go there and have a bad meal i would be incredibly surprised the ray road location has an outside seating area which looks at the lake and the inside is very pleasant as are all the staff the only thing i am not crazy about with the southern avenue location is that it is quite noisy in there and the acoustics are not good although they have placed soundproof boards around the walls to dampen the noise,1.0

i treated my mom and myself to sea pearl facials bottoms up pedicures and luxury manicures on april 1st 2014 at the spa i have lived in the ballantyne area for years however this was my first visit to the spa at ballantyne overall we were very satisfied with every service we received we were welcomed and had a full tour of the facilities upon arrival i personally had leigh for my facial and she was amazing she talked with me at length about my skin type the products that would work well and the experience was incredibly relaxing i have had facials before but this is the best one ive ever had my mom was equally satisfied with her service and said she could have stayed on the table forever i had choyoung for my bottoms up pedicure and luxury manicure she was an expert and sought to ensure comfort at every step my mom and i had these together and it was a great experience  relaxing refreshing and lots of good chatter we had a beautiful view of the golf course and were sipping complimentary pomegranate martinis during these services i have not been doing a manipedi on a regular basis but am considering adding this on a monthly basis choyoung was very welcoming friendly and efficient the only part of our day that really irritated me was our checkout after gathering our things from the locker room we came back up to check out my mother went into the shop to browse while i waited to pay there was one customer at the desk actively engaged in a conversation with the man behind the desk there was a woman behind the desk also not participating in the discussion but seemed like she was politely listening she clearly saw us walk up and my mother go into the shop i stood there for a bit expecting that since the other customer was actively engaged in conversation with the other staff member she would respond but did not i almost said excuse me but given i do customer service for a living as well i wanted to see how long she would ignore me i continued to stand there and finally she lindsey greeted me i must say she was the most cold and rude person i encountered at the spa she presented me with the itemized bill before charging my card with 700 in services and a forced 20 gratuity i normally tip 20 and would have anyway but its nice for the customer to have that choice and then focused back on the previous conversation while she was printing receipts it was almost as if i was a bother to her after i received my receipt i started to walk into the shop and i heard her greet the person behind me with a totally different attitude after the fantastic service received from all of their services staff throughout the day it was not something i expected at the end it goes to show you that a borderline rude customer experience at the end can ruin the entire impression of a business additionally i sent this feedback in email to the spa and heard absolutely nothing from themnot even a sorry,1.0

i joined back in october with assurances that i could cancel anytime  at the end of march i called to cancel because i was taking a work assignment out of state  they sent me the cancellation paperwork with instructions to drop it off at the carefree location which i did on april 4th  they told me it would take about 10 days to process  being very busy i havent done a good job of checking my credit card transactions  imagine my surprise when i saw three charges for 65 on my credit card dated april 17 may 17 and june 17  i called the office expecting it was just an oversight but was told per the terms of agreement that i could not cancel  first of all that is not what i was told when i signed up and nothing was said when i processed the paperwork  then i was told that the general manager left a voice mail for me april 6th about the cancellation  i never got any voicemail  the proper way to communicate on matters such as these is email where you can document the interaction  such an underhanded scam  i am out 200 because of these money grubbing crooks but i will take some satisfaction in warning others not to enter the membership agreement,0.0

been getting my nails done since i was 16 im 29 now i know what is what and ive tried a lot of places in vegas i always get geli have a place ive gone to for 3 years but a gal pal called one day to say she was stressed and wanted a pedicure to relax i decided id go and try out this new place with her it was great clean  modern and the pedicure was awesome it was relaxing she took her time messaging and doing all the luxuriesnot to mention they give u all the stuff they used on you to take home as a gift nail file buffer etcshe also had her hand color changed while she did her pedicure she loved it it was mood changing polish fast forward a month later i decided id go back alone and get another pedicure but also a gel fill on my hands the girl offered me all the different types of pedicures and i decided on the second to most expensive one a step above the one i did last time the pedicure lasted maybe 20 mins it was totally rushed and not at all the experience of the first timeno massage or buffing of my ski and feet  and i didnt get the little baggy with all my stuff they used on me but i figured whatever shes prob superrrr busy and needs to rush for her next client she does my fill for my nails and i pick a color i ask her 2x if that brand chips because i had a bad experience with one particular company and didnt want a repeat experience she and the guy working next to her said no that brand doesnt chip and how they agree that the brand i had a bad experience with is commonly complained about but that i had nothing to worry about with this brand so i went ahead with it nails came out nice but nothing special total price for that days services 108 less than 24hours later one entire nail gel peels off in one chunk 2 days later 2 more peel and chip off at the sides and tip so i called and asked if they had a guarantee on their services and they said yes if its within the 7 days time so i asked to come in that day and they said they were completely booked so i scheduled a touch up for the following day 7th day since the service i arrive on time and pick a color from a different brand and i sit down and the receptionist who has been on the phone talking to her boyfriend about what to pick up for food for 10mins ignores me i had to get her attention and ask to be helped im told to wait because the girl who serviced me last time was finishing up her other client i wait and then when shes free i sit on her chair she takes the color and starts writing a ticket to charge me 35 i asked her why im being charged if im there to fix the problem with an attitude she tells me since its not the same brand its considered a polish change i said no sorry im not paying for it so she smugly says so u want the same color u did last time i said no why would i want that if it didnt last she says well thats the policy and u are suppose to come within the 7 days i said i am here within the 7days with an attitude she says well you are here on the 7th day so its the end of the time okkkkk but i am here within the 7days if thats the rule why is this an issue i said i didnt want the same polish and i wasnt paying for a new polish that 108 a week ago was enough she tears up the ticket and slams her drawer shut she says i guess i wont charge you since your throwing a fit mind u ive been calm and very respectful the whole time she proceeds to do my nails and doesnt speak a word to me for 30mins fine the receptionist 45 mins later still on the same loud call fighting w her boyfriend about what and where to eat my nail girl rolls her eyes and says thats a common thing and shakes her head anywaysi left there feeling embarrassed and shamed i call my gal pal who introduced me to the place and tell her my story she then tells me she too had her gel polish peel off within a few days she thought maybe shed done something wrong and her brand was completely different than the 2 i tried within days my new polish change chipped and i had to go back to my reg place with my tail between my legs and get my usual girl to fix me upafter coming on here i notice at least 4 or 5 reviews complaining about the nail polish peeling off as well so i know its not something we did ill never go back and ill never recommend them,0.0

edit 5313  my fiances screen went out again randomly today she ended up taking it to a phone repair place near old town and according to that store the company that installed the screen inspectur gadget did a shoddy job and didnt install the screen properly luckily it was a quick fix but it also cost us 45 for something this stupid business messed up on again seriously if your reading these reviews go elsewhere quick fix cellular is good option for the east valleyi had high hopes for this place i really did i bookmarked them on yelp after finding out that such a service existed right down the road from me now if your considering using them i have some words of advice right up front1 use these guys if you can stand to be without your phone for possibly several days 2 use them if live close by or dont mind driving out to val vistawarner rd multiple times 3 if you cant be without your phone for more than a day use them if you are prepared to zip over to their store for their 10 am opening at a moments notice if you cant stomach any of the above warnings dont buy their groupon or use their service first of all they need to stop doing groupon i live in scottsdale now in order to get same day service and not be without a phone for more than a day i had to drive out there with my groupon in hand and then they said they will call me when the parts arrive for the phone why cant i email them my groupon or call them with my groupon number why make it so difficult then about 2 weeks later i finally call them asking what the status is they said the parts arrived today and i can come in tomorrow so the next day i arrive at 1030 and they said it will be 3 hours bring a book or a laptop because youre stuck in this side of town luckily i had errands in the east valley so i knocked them out while waiting really funny thing is every time i come here to drop off the phone they ask for a cell number to call me when its ready not sure how many people have 2 phones but that cant be the case for most people got the phone back looking as good as new but then over the next few days we notice the screen has a spot where it does not recognize touch this is a big problem i understand parts have defects its why they say they have a warranty now i had to drive back out again well i called in advance the guy said to come down at any time sounds suspicious based on what they told me before on their shortage of parts this time i made sure to get there right at 1000 am the guy then tried to tell me it will be done by the end of the day hahahaha i didnt stand for that one bit if it was not for my sternness i would have let these guys ruin my whole day i got them to get it done in 3 hours still too long in my opinion one thing that really worried me is that the lobby was filled with other angry customers that mixed with the yelp reviews makes leaves me to say i will not be using their service again i think this could be a great service if they mixed in a lot more customer service and focus on giving the customer a good experience and not how many repairs can they get through in a day so to conclude they get 2 stars since they did fix the problem with the phone no question,0.0

subpar restaurant that is empty for a reason be aware1 the groupon is misleading and forces customers to order from a different section of the menu thats 810 more than the lunch specials for the exact same portions this negates the groupon discount entirely and ive found businesses have been resorting more and more to these shady tactics to use groupon to draw customers in then skewering them with high costs or bizarre rules to compensate for the discount theyre providing this blindsided us when it was time to pay the bill2 the meat cutter had no gloves on while he was working the machine to cut the meat there was a bucket of water by his feet and towel that he kept reaching into to wipe the counter he went from bucket to the meat 3 food is subpar the meats and veggies are medium to low quality with an off color that you can see by viewing the photos in this yelp entry4 service was middle of the road and there was a language barrier we had to repeat our order and clarify it multiple times 5 portions are skimpy you will leave hungry dont let the photos fool you the meat covers the plate but its cut razor thin each slice is paper thinat nearly 30 per person this place is way overpriced for boiled meat rice and frozen vegetables for excellent shabu check out yojie japanese fondue instead superior quality meat better location better interior and better service for the exact same price,0.0

robertos can be found pretty much throughout lv the food is excellent and well priced what makes this place even more awesome is the fact that its open 24hrs we need this in californiaduring this specific visit i ordered a chicken chimichanga which came with rb the portions were so huge that i couldnt even finish it more importantly the taste was really good and i tried to finish but just did not have the room i ended up finishing the rest of the chimi rb later and it held up well despite being in the fridge for 6 hours,1.0

exceptional customer service experiencethis review is in regards to the amazing customer service we recieved by kaylai came with a friend that highly recommended the vegan burger here so i had to try itfirst of all  let me just say kayla went above and beyond and even exceeded our expectationswe ordered drinks my friend asked for something that wasnt normally offered and kayla made it happen it may not have been a big deal to her but the fact that she took a few extra moments of her time to do what she did really spoke volumes to me and about her i used to be a server and this would totally have been something i would have doneshe was so sweet and came back several times to make sure everything was okaythe vegan burger was delicious it wasnt dry at all there was a vegan cheese on it that tasted great as well and the size did not dissapoint we ate it with fries and they had great flavor that complimented the meal yardhouse has always been a good choice for food or drinks it had a been a while since i last ate here but kayla really shined yesterday and i thought i should take my own moment to make this review thank you so much kayla for being so awesome you made a great night even better just by being you you are a superstar,1.0

i interviewed here and i was disgusted i dislike ag their retail locations and products cause me anxiety and depression i interviewed and submitted my resume in some gross fascination with how the place looks inside disgusting reenters my thoughts this place looks like the office space movie with an exponent for sprawling obsolescence layers into aged infrastructurethe people i interviewed with were doltish unattractive boring and i would generally like to watch them do my laundry in the process they will also write birthday cards to people i dislike who have died i still have addresses of remaining survivors in the dreaded city of cleveland where american greetings was founded the goofball that walked me through to my interview room had the clumsy pride to refer to desk spaces and team structure as pods this must have some resonance with flower pods and their rosebud logo my only discovery and conclusion in the matter is that he was retarded  i understand a new building in crocker park is being constructed the  longer sustainability of the company is questionable with building delays uncertain corporate entity existence and declining financials they have a technology branch subsidiary with dubious name of american greetings interactive hope for the best  pod crew,0.0

this is the worst nail salon i have experienced i gave this place a few chances since it is close to my home 5 minutes but im willing to drive the distance for better service today i called before arriving to ask about the wait and was told 20 minutes i get there and wait for an hour before i left without having my nails done its probably for the best considering i never like the job they did in the past but never again,0.0

excellent food and lots of it most of the time food quality suffers when so many options are available but not at green forest i loved the variety  everything from leg of lamb to baconwrapped turkey the hot foods and salad bar were impressive too  lots of options and very cleanthe prices may seem a little higher than youre used to for a meal but the amount and variety of food make it worth every pennyprotip its a little hard to find at night as its in a small plaza without great signage,1.0

recently discovered jamba juice in the past couple months i cant believe theyve been around a long time and ive never stopped into one this one is closest to work and ive been heading there for lunch for basically a meal replacement drink i usually add whey protein to the berry workout thats my favthe best part about this location is the customer service all the employees seem to have a friendly face and attitude makes you feel good about picking their business to stop in and spend your money hey why not someone is being nice to me while im spending my hardearned moolah plus i get a yummy drink that substitutes as my meal i dont have to pack a lunch and worry about refrigeration etc the jamba juice is refreshing cool and feels my tummy full of yummy goodness wow the pumpkin smash lite was delish i might add perfect for halloween seasonyeah the drinks are kind of spendy but imho is it really different than those who choose to spend 57 on a combo meal at a fast food restaurant or those who spend 5 or more per day on specialty coffee or tea drinks this is healthier than most fast food deep fried or fatty options however you need to be careful of calories and sugar content in this drinks too but they offer light versions there are pamphlets and nutrition information readily available in the store if you have any questions or need to modify a drink just ask im sure they will try to accomodate youthey offer grilled sandwiches now too i havent tried one yet but they smell yummy when im in the store next on the todo listthere are so many combinations of drinks here i dont think ill get sick of trying new things for awhile plus i dont have to wash the blender ha ha hate doing that at home when i make smoothies its almost worth a couple of extra bucks not to have to deal with that hassle of taking the blender apart and putting it back together plus having all the fresh or frozen ingredients on hand in the right combination much easier just to roll on into this fast and friendly jamba juice and get your juice fix or even your veggie fix if thats your thing,0.0
oyshi sushi came highly recommended from a buddy of mine back in hawaii he said the next time youre in las vegas you need to check out this place and that ill thank him later this place did not disappoint this is handsdown now my favorite place for sushi here in las vegasthere are ample parking in the strip mall this is a very nice restaurant outside and inside the restaurant is very elegant spacious with high ceilings this location appears to be a new building so everything if fresh new clean they have a very impressive array of sushi rollselections from your basic sashimi and nigiri sushi to their hand rolls and signature hand rolls if you love sushi i highly recommend ordering their signature hand rolls and other hand rolls most of these selections are very exotic and unique nice combination and mixing of ingredients the hand rolls were my favorites hereservice is exceptional they kept coming to see how we were doing as well as making sure our drinks were topped off or didnt run lowthe next time youre in las vegas take a drive away from the strip for some really fine handcrafted sushioh and did i forget to mention its all you can see for about 35 even better yummy,1.0
i was arrested for speeding over 35 mph in a 65 mph zone as an out of stater i was frustrated to learn it is treated as a criminal speeding or class 3 misdemeanor in arizona after talking to a dozen of people and searching the internet my frustration only grew up i learned that if i pleaded guilty the violation will go on my criminal record will it show up as a criminal speeding or a class 3 misdemeanor will it affect my employment those questions were not easy to answer in fact i still dont know answers to them even the lawyers i talked to werent so sure with their answers it was one of these  its just a moving violation it will show up as that on your criminal record shouldnt lead to any complications its a moving violation but it is classified as a misdemeanor crime it may cause you troubles but we dont know for sure we are not even sure if the criminal record will classify the type of misdemeanor saying it was just excess speedinghere are other examples of misdemeanor crimes on google petty theft prostitution public intoxication simple assault trespass vandalism discharging a firearm within city limitsi decided to mitigate my risks of future legal complications with that case and started looking for a lawyeri got to hear a lot different voices on the phone and i classified them as follows not interested in the case not confident they could win the case not capable of establishing the lawyer  client connection and making me believe that at least they will try to win the caseand then i heard one of the lawyers from corso and rhude energetic and confident voice told me that even though they cannot guarantee success they will make sure they will do everything possible to drop the charges and heres howhe carefully collected some information about me to represent a human being not a casehe told me i just wanna make the prosecutor see you as a normal lawabiding guy who made a mistake it was very reassuring he described in steps how it works and what are my options he patiently answered all my questions and in the end of the call i had a piece of paper with a detailed plan i knew exactly what they are going to do and that put my mind at ease even though they operate in phoenix i was told they established connections with prosecutors throughout the state they know them they talk to them they do business with them and have a pretty good share of cases resolved in favor of their clientsduring an informal review of my case with the prosecutor my lawyer was able to negotiate dropping of my charges to a civil infraction he said his client was very determined in having the criminal charges dropped and hed sure go ahead and stand the trial if it doesnt happen now heres the trick prosecutors may work with hundreds of cases at the same time and they are interested to reach an agreement in the plea bargain phase that means not going to trial nobody likes going to trial it just sometimes the stakes may be high and trial is your only viable optionhe kept pushing further to make her agree to dropping points of my driver recordno way this is gonna happen was the answer  he was doing over 100he comes back to me tells me the story and gives me two options either accept the deal or go to trial he recommended not to go to trial because weve got a pretty fair deal but it was up to methe thing here is that they wouldnt have charged me anything had i decided to go to trial its in their best interests to cut you a deal before the trial so i couldve but fighting in the trial just for the points on your driver record would be downright stupid and im pretty sure i wouldve loose if not the case then the time and moneystandard fee for my case was 2000 to be paid in advance i was able to negotiate it down to 1800 even though 2000 was a very fair price on the market at that time this example of willing to negotiate coupled with the other examples above is the quintessence of being a good law firm,0.0
we are very pleased with our sunscreens and screen doors from cc sunscreens  they are professional to work with have excellent prices and have a high quality product  we had 25 sunscreens and 2 screendoor coverings made two weeks ago to cover the windows on the south and west sides of our house  we have noticed such a difference that i have already contacted cc about getting more sunscreens for our windows that face northwest  they were on time for all appointments  their installers are friendly and professional and paid close attention to detailwe have a large home and have suffered through high electricity bills for years  i didnt think that sunscreens would make a difference because our house has dual pane low e windows  we havent received our utility bill yet but i definitely feel a difference in the house  there are areas that always felt warm and stuffy  our eating area has windows on three sides  we had these covered and it now feels much more comfortable being in this area in the afternoon  at the end of april i was only turning the ac on at night and i have noticed that at the end of the day  the temp is about 45 degrees cooler than it was before we put the sun screens on,1.0

k blossom is a great addition to the asian beauty stores in las vegas  in fact its probably my new favorite i stopped in this evening with my husband and was very impressedthe shop itself is cute well lit and clean as far as ambiance goes this place has other k beauty stores in the valley soundly beat no contest they offer a selection of clothing and accessories but it wasnt what i was shopping for so this review is only for their cosmetics and skincare the customer service was fantastic the woman working behind the counter wish i could remember her name was so helpful without being pushy she made easy conversation and recommended a few products that i already use and really enjoy she was genuinely knowledgable about the products and offered great suggestionstheir single sheet mask selection is very good and the prices are reasonable they are more than you would pay online but its worth it to find out if you like a sheet mask before you buy a box of ten of them online they had face neck hand and lip masks as well as the new dr jart rubber masks skinfood washoff masks etc they also had a great selection of ab products that are popular in the us misshas first treatment essence dr jarts ceramidin cream cosrx low ph cleanser etc as well as a few products that i was told were popular in korea that i hadnt heard of before they had testers out for everything  so if you want to try out a cushion color hand cream etc before buying this is the placei purchased two sheetmasks and a package of cosrx hydrocolloid acne patches and received three samples pretty great considering i only spent 12 they also offer a free sheet mask with a 20 order and check in which is a great yelp checkin offer,1.0
i have stayed at the downtown grand 10 or more times i have gambled almost exclusively there i received offers for free rooms and consequently chose to stay and play there i recently tried to redeem my free rooms for nov and was told they were not honoring the offers they had sent out  i was offered no compromise and was told i could get a crumby discount of 149 a night as opposed to four free nights the least they could have done was honor the offers they sent out and started new ones after they had expired  i spoke to casino host who offered no solution and said all the other hosts had left for other properties  the property has definitely struggled in many ways since opening  we overlooked many problems based on the fair comps  if those are gone there are other properties our money will be better spent  such a disappointment,0.0

what could have been a problem was promptly handled by their reservation agent kaykayla making reservations through a third party can be problematic but since i had personally been to this hotel when it first opened and many times since i decided to actually stay here  when i booked the hotel online i noticed that many of the rooms had two small beds this obviously would not work for a newly dating couple and kaykayla took care of it very professionallythe room itself was a tad dark and the bathroom is small but the location and vibe of the hotel make up for the shortcomings of its age  food is very good service was great and everyone was very accommodating during the entire staywill stay here againcheers,1.0

very good after a long bus ride ginkgo certainly hit the spot for some delicious brunch fare the aesthetic is very nice and feels pretty hip with high ceilings and careful decorations my friend and i both opted for the florentine eggs benedict which was basically an eggs benedict with white cheddar and spinach the breakfast potatoes were really good i am a bit of breakfast potato connoisseur and these were delicious very crispy with green onions and maybe a squeeze of lemon it also came with a fresh fruit salad and a coffee or tea i did not know that it came with coffee or tea and had ordered a tea and when we saw the price of the breakfast not including the tea we informed our waitress who informed us that it was included which was a nice surprise however i think they should advertise this the price was very reasonable and came out to just over 15 with tax for quite a lot of food and a drink in a very aesthetically pleasing location would definitely go again,1.0
i love the addition of this place to the downtown area the food was very good and there were a lot of tasty options to chose from i had a pasta dish and the pasta was perfectly hand made and tasted delicate and delicious the drinks were crafty and very smooth i will certainly be back and wouldnt decline an offer to eat here it is a little noisy but that is to be expected at most popular restaurants,1.0

i have wondered past this place a couple of times on my way home from work as i work at queens park and live near yongebloor i think the actual signage keeps people away from this restaurant as asahi sushi near my house was closed and wow sushi wasnt that great last time i was there we decided to venture over to bay street i cant state how happy i am that we did there was only one other person inside this restaurant for lunch on a saturday assumed the worst but got the best we both ordered combinations with sushi sashimi and rolls i cant emphasize enough how delicious the rolls are with some extra seasoning on them the chef puts some definite love into his work the fish were extremely fresh the portion size was good the salad and soup were good they asked us if we wanted more i love this place it is a few dollars more but this is my new go to spot and i will walk the extra 2 blocks from asahi to go to this place from now on if you are in the area and love sushi definitely check this place out  even worth traveling to  yes i said it and i never say that only downside is that if the place was full service could be slow,1.0

only giving it a 1 because you cant do zero  we get there and they put my husband and 70 year old dad right in the middle of traffic  in a very claustrophobic booth  we ask to move after ordering our drinks  took 20 minutes to get our drinks even after we told both waitresses and the hostess helped us move  pops and i both ordered the 16oz prime rib so we could have leftovers for lunch the next day   they bring out our prime ribs and say our baked potatoes are on the way  pictures attached  almost half of it was fat  i said oh my gosh thats a lot of fat  waitress says nothing   pops and my hubby ordered salads and i ordered mushrooms as my other side   they bring my daughters and husbands meals came  a few minutes later we get out baked potatoes   hubby says where is my potato   well they had given him my mushrooms and he was well on his way of eating them   so you would think id get new mushrooms right  nope  just slide the half eaten mushrooms to my plate   then we order another round of drinks and it takes 20 minutes to get a half chill fireball shot    so not a good experience  if im paying 25 for a 16oz prime rib i should get close to 16oz  not 8oz of meat and 8oz of fat   also its supposed to be unlimited bread  how many loaves do you think we got  yup 1  not a happy experience,0.0

my first statement is that this is better than ice cream i know thats a strong statement but my when i took my first bite of my rise and shine acai bowl i was in heaven this is exactly what i needed to cool off for summer its not overly sweet and creamy like ice cream and gelato but has a refreshing and healthy taste not the bad kind of healthy taste but the good one the taste that makes you want to eat healthy for every meal at first i thought the price was a little high but now i am more than happy to pay the price its a much healthier alternative to ice cream i could honestly eat this for every meal of summer also it is gmo freethe rise and shine acai bowl with vitamin c is 852 the only thing that wasnt what i like was the mango because it was in chunks near the core but i can just order it without the mango 100 recommend this place,1.0
i approached the owner of the hostel with a request to shoot a scene in a movie at her location  i was happily surprised when the owner replied with an immediate yesi loved the look of the hostel a unique venue to be sure  they have an outdoor performance area lots of native plants and an interior that speaks of the history of the hostel and the city itself  the staff at the hostel was very helpful even staying late to assist us  ive done my fair share of hosteling across europe and the us and this hostel is by far the most welcoming place ive encountered if you are hosteling you should come to phoenix and stay here  youll love it,1.0

what a disappointment the drinks were average and that was the best part of the meal the pub burger had no flavor except for the egg and you have two choices either medium or medium well the italian burger was no better no flavor tomato bruschetta was just chopped cherry tomatoes sad the fries are cooked fast and sit on the counter while your burger cooks so they end up soggy and not hot anymore really save your money and go to mcdonalds its better than broadway bad burger bar,0.0

didnt pick these guys  my home warranty company american home shield did ahs has a history of sending very poor contractors and this was no exception these guys were rude and unprofessional they couldnt even close the door behind them and my cat almost got out several times i submitted a ticket with three items they claimed that all they had was one but managed to check and see the 2nd issue wasnt covered they were very obviously looking to do as little work as possible they were attempting to fix a light which was part of a ceiling fan assembly  in the process of fixing it they discovered it had a feature that allowed it to operate with a remote control they refused to fix it so that i could order a remote to operate it as a new home owner who didnt get a remote when i moved in how was i supposed to know it was remote control they demanded that i produce the remote control if i wanted that portion fixed and without it they chose to bypass the capability and rip out the remote receiver they told me if i wanted it fixed i would have to place another service call through the warranty company and pay another 60 deductible nice to know this trip cost me 60 and lost functionality of my lightfanperhaps they were only operating under the guidelines that ahs sets  ahs is a horrible company to begin with ill save that story for another review but these guys were very unprofessional and rude in the way they dealt with the entire visit  as a home owner i wouldnt dream of having them back when the choice is up to me they also dont accept credit cards with the repair man pointing out that they are too risky and insinuated that by expecting his company to take my credit card i was somehow trying to rip him off,0.0
wow what a huge disappointment coming here was the staff was good a we were seated quickly for a friday night  we have heard so much good we passed on grimaldis to come here ordered the antipasto for 11 it was ok but not enough for 2 people pricey for little ordered regina margherita doc this was just awful this thing looked like it fell on the floor 3 faint cheese spots with 3 basil leave mostly on 1 side and a cherry tomato not a san marzano like advertised the sauce was bland and tasted like tomato soup concentrate 14 very pricey this with 2 glasses of wine costs me 60ouchfor anyone who cooks or likes to eat you have to have passion and present your food as the best value this was a meager attempt at that maybe this la piazza has seen its better days i will never know as i wont return,0.0

the cake itself was not bad and dealing with lisa and carolyn was pleasant if not always timely or informativethe cake was a massive disappointment  the writing on the cake was sketchy like imagine is you tried to write with a paintbrush without practicing at allnone of the corners on the patterned design lined up incrediblythere was a feature on the cake that was made out of something hard but foam like here they had cut it out wrong and instead of redoing it had just added another layer in spots which was beyond obviousat first glance it was exactly what i wanted  upon closer inspection it looked totally thrown together without even the slightest hint of care im so surprised to see all these rave reviews maybe they threw my cake together since i was from out of town  i felt like a fool for spending so much money and being so friendly with people who obviously did not care at all,0.0

love is an amazing show that transports you across time through music  the whole performance is set to beatles hits and is extremely well put together  there are thousands of reviews that state why you should go to this show  i agree that this is a must seethe midsized auditorium offers great views for every angle  we scored half price tickets during a mlife promotion so were able to sit front row for 80 each  this gave us a great vantage to really see the emotion on the performers faces  the performers would interact with us and my wife even was given a rose by the star during the bows the music is well choreographed and the speakers are bumping  i have never been in a room with so much energythere are many cirque du soliel shows in vegas  but this one stands out among the rest,1.0

until my vacation earlier this month i hadnt flown in years  after most of the stress of planning ten days away had passed i moved on to researching my parking options  i found that offsite parking lots were not much cheaper than the longterm parking directly at the airport  i debated thinking that if i went offsite that would at least mean i was guaranteed a spot and wouldnt have to drive around the airport lots  then i found a sweet deal online for globe through waycom  the total for ten days was around 45 a deal that sounded too good to be true  my next step was to see if i could find any reviews for globe parking online  thanks to the awesome reviews here from my fellow yelpers i did not hesitate a minute longer and booked my spacethe day of my very early morning flight i drove to globe where i found several other people also arriving  i quickly checked in and got my ticket and information on contacting them for when i return  i had no idea what to expect and was surprised to find several employees working checking people in and loading bags on to the shuttle van  did i mention this was at 3am  its about a ten minute ride from globe to the airport  my dropoff driver was friendly and my handshake somehow even turned into a hug  theyre so fast and efficient i was there and in line before the kiosks to checkin for flights were even open  the only hiccup i encountered was in returning home  i tried to call for pick up but their line was busy on several attempts  i finally got through and waited about 15 minutes which i expected for pickup from the airport along with a few other globe patrons  upon returning to the lot i overheard that they were having issues with their phones and internet which they were actively trying to remedy  i couldnt fault them for that it happens  once i checked out since i used the online deal i had already paid ahead making check out easier i was told to keep the info on waycom for next time  the whole experience was better than i expected from beginning to end  great and friendly customer service from a company that knows their business  they even offer car washes detailing and a few other services that can be done while youre away  i highly recommend globe parking to anyone looking for extended airport parking,1.0

i have to say ive heard endless things about sugar factory usually about the cool drinks last night i went there for the first time ever and it will absolutely be the last time i go there a friend of mine had complained about a food item he ordered which the menu clearly states is two veggie patties not only did it get served incorrectly but then on top of it when my friend had vocalized his concern to our waiter he then proceeded to get the manager now i have been a manager for a company for four  years and i have to say the way this manager not only approached our table which he had his hand on our empty chair and was slouching and then instead of introducing himself and asking how our meal was he said whats wrong with your food really i honestly was dumb founded after a few minutes of his bantering with my friend who granted yes he was getting upset but on top of it the manager said they had been changing their menus and and the menu did state that it came with two patties but then when we asked to have what the menu stated he claimed his chef would not allow that which makes no sense then he proceeds to tell my friend that sarcasm will get him nowhere im sorry my friend was not being sarcastic i then put my opinion on the table and reexplained what my friend had said he then stated all he could offer was 50 off the meal okay so let me get this right instead of just letting the two people who want an extra veggie patty like your menu clearly states which is probably 2 you then instead say you will give them 50 off their meal makes no sense they just want what they ordered then not only that but religiously through our entire meal the manager was gossiping to all the other waiters and waitress who kept staring at us then our waiter also went to another waitress and started gossiping this was by far thee worst experiences ive ever had being in management i am immensely disgusted by this managers behavior and i will do everything in my power to make sure it is known all this manager had to do was approach our table and say im sorry i heard you had inquiry about your menu choice ive very sorry for the inconvenience but we are in the middle of changing our menu and i am aware it does say two patties but at this time i cannot give you two patties however we can make you a different meal if you like or you can pay the extra for another patty and furthermore i am very sorry for the inconvenience but no he was the most rude abrupt and inconsiderate manager ive ever met my bill alone with my friend was 50 and that wasnt including my three other friends bill we didnt tip the waiter and i will never ever go back here again,0.0

pass up this onethis small starbucks stand is located inside a safeway supermarket with zero ambiance and a generally unfriendly staff  also ive been there on more than occasion when the starbucks chain was offering a special pricing promotion  but this place would not honor the promotion saying  oh were not doing that promotionwhat kind of deal is that  i often get the impression this starbucks is little more than an afterthought  pass this one up  there is a larger more pleasant one in the nearby frys supermarket on yuma road that does honor the promotions if you have a frys card and of course there are lots of other starbucks or dutch bros,0.0
this simple looking groceryrestaurant is run by the same person who worked the yummy woodfired pizza oven at norman hardie estate out in prince edward county we have been to his restaurant twice on the recommendation of the winery itself and both times it was pizza and norman hardie wines this pizza is my favourite in the city and is the same style as libretto  thin scorched crust and simple delicious toppings the crust recipe is very important to this style of pie and it is excellent here do not let the basic layout of the space fool you this is excellent food,1.0
ive eaten and ordered take out from senbazuru for years and ive vowed to never go there again after this last time for a while now ive noticed the service deteriorate especially from one waitress in particular as a nonasian patron there is a noticeable difference in treatment received the service has gotten to a point of downright rudeness with plates being slid across the table rather than placed not to mention plates and glasses are not washed well and noticeably dirty this last time we walked into an empty restaurant and we were told to sit anywhere we liked only after we received our drinks and a party of 10 people no reservations arrived we were asked to move normally i have no problem with that but there was plenty of room in the restaurant to accommodate the group size however they wanted to sit together in the area where we were of course being of asian descent the request had to be accommodated to summarize with a influx of sushi restaurants in the area there is no reason to frequent this place food is mediocre the place and dishes are dirty and the service as ive mentioned is completely disgusting,0.0
tim was very helpful but the company he suggested to me haggert home improvements left a hole between the rad pipes laid tile that squeeked and shifted after it was laid also if ever considering haggert home improvements do not pay by the hour when i called tile city hoping to get some support it was clear that this wasnt going to happen even though the person i spoke with agreed when i sent photos to the store that the job was not done correctly,0.0
since i go to ocad i frequent this place pretty often i usually get the kake udon which is the cheapest udon dish and comes with just four pieces of fish cake for just over 4 or the beef niku udon for a couple dollars more the soup is addictive and the dish is simple and filling you can make any dish into a combo for another 2 and have a choice of two out of three items takosen soup or salad they say they also have chips available on the menu but every time ive asked they dont have it so ive given up takosen are a good pick for combos as you get two takoyaki a popular japanese snack made of batter balls with a piece of octopus inside sandwiched between two rice crackers this place is such a great deal and the food is amazing for the price im not japanese so i cant say how authentic the food is but it certainly feels healthier to eat here than some of the other places in the grange also its nice to have a proper sitdown restaurant with nondisposable chopsticks and clean tables i have booked the place for large groups before 10 ppl the hours are sometimes a bit odd as some days they close later than others and they usually open at 1130 am and sometimes they are late to open but booking solves the problem if there is one also even though its japanese dont expect sushi here the main pull is udon,1.0

i would like to say i am the most terrified of dentists i had to go because i had a throbbing pain for months that became unbearable so i googled and reviewed several dentists and this one stood out first it was their hours which fit my work schedule then it was the reviews i was so nervous when i got there but the warmth i felt from karla eased me a little still nervous karla walked with me down the hall of doom where i met dr amy and she was so kind and empathetic to my panicky demeanor i had 2 teeth pulled yikes but she almost had me so calm that i was actually ok she talks to you to make you feel comfortable and that youre in good hands she also called me to check on me afterwards kudos for that would i return if it was up to me no but dr amy and karla said i have to and i trust them now i still have some fears but at least there i dont fear the people,0.0

ive suffered several injuries as a result of a few car accidents as a result i had constant pain in my shoulders neck and back that often turned into migraine headaches making it nearly impossible to function i went to my regular pcp and all he did was prescribe me pills the pills helped with the pain a little but they caused other side effects that i didnt particularly like so the doctor started prescribing me more pills for the side effects caused by the first set of pills at that point i decided i was tired of masking the pain and wanted a real fix not a drug induced fix thats when i started looking into chiropractic careafter going through some good and some not so good chiropractors i finally met dr reed at a home improvement show in phoenix i was attracted to his booth with his fancy system for determining where the back problems are after talking with him i was happy to find out his office was really close to my office so i set up an adjustment for the following weekwhen i went to the office i was thoroughly impressed with the professionalism honesty and skill that dr reed and his staff exhibited there was no high pressure sales pitch the exam was thorough before an adjustment was made and the cost without insurance was totally affordableeven though i have since moved jobs and their office isnt as convenient i still go out of my way to see dr reed on a regular basis every 2 weeks ever since i started a regular maintenance plan i have not had a single migraine sure i still get a few nagging pains here and there but they are nowhere as debilitating as before and i can get in quickly to see dr reed and all is well again ,0.0
i hate this place i had the worst experience i have a regular stylist who went back home to chicago for the summer i was approached about this salon and their new location i called explained my hair type and style and asked who would be best to serve me the receptionist advised me which stylist would be best and i booked the appointment i showed up 10 minutes early the stylist i was told would be styling that day rudely informed me she was a level 5 stylist with a full client list and any stylist in the salon could do a good job i should have walked out then but i didnt i told myself lets give the stylist a chance i came in with my hair done as i always wear it i explained exactly what i needed and wanted as well as showed the stylist pictures i left in tears she butchered my hair i was very disappointed i will never step foot in that salon ever again i wouldnt wish that experience on anyone i have been to different hair salons trying to find a stylist that fits me i was hoping to finally end this long search this is why despite my initial interaction i decided to give the younger stylist a chance i honestly was hoping to find someone i could rely on regularly my current stylist is always in and out of town she has done this for many years and this is no longer a job to her its hobby so shes not always availablethis was a complete disaster i left in tears and cried for 3 hours i had to go to fantastic sams near my home to help clean up the mess the stylist left me with i wear a sassy short hair cut but not a mulllet with the extensive explaining and pictures i for sure thought i would leave at the least satisfied or with something i could work with i cannot do anything but wait for this disaster to grow out i am devistated and i would think twice three even four times before you take a risk at this salon i will say this the salon lay out is nice and the atomosphere is upbeat however the skills are just not there,0.0
ok if i give this place a great review can the rest of vegas please not come here i literally drive across town to go to this urgent care because its the best one in vegas in my opinion however dont tell anyone if you check in online they will literally call you and tell you what time to show up i have never sat in the waiting room for more than ten minutes furthermore this place is so clean compared to some of the other crackhead urgent cares in town every doctor ive dealt with here has been fantastic too my husband refuses to listen to me and he goes to the urgent care near our house over there he sits around for two plus hours and has a bunch of weirdos to deal with in a subpar waiting room lurking with germs and contagion meanwhile im in and out of this place and have my rx filled at cvs in less than an hour for all of it hands down  best urgent care in vegas,1.0

quite some time ago i saw this place on travel channels top 50 unique places to eat or something like that the idea of a fusion of oriental and mexican food intrigued me knowing that i would not be going to phoenix any time soon i put it in the back of my mindended up in phoenix on business and needed to find a place to eat the back of my mind reminded me of some place with mexicanoriental fusion searched yelp and came up with chino bandido and it was only 4 miles from my hoteli wanted to experience as many flavors as possible so i ordered an al la cart carnitas burrito  a combination bowl with jade chicken chile relleno jerk chicken fried rice and cuban black beans i wish i could have ordered more but the portion sizes are too big and i would have been miserable because i would have eaten every bite the chile relleno was fantastic the crispy exterior was so uniquewow the flavors exploded in my mouth the food was greatthe thing that impressed me more than the food was the service if any one wants an example of  great customer service for a model for their own business after even without eating a bite of the delicious food a visit to chino bandido is would be worth the trip the staffs compensation is either based on the the satisfaction of the clientele of they are part owners because everyone of them acted as if it was their business it was my first visit and i did not know the menu or how to order no problem i was greeted by friendly staff who directed me to a line of neophytes when it was my turn the young lady asked me  some questions and then offered bites of different menu items  explained some of the many options available for me to order i even had to ask her to cut down the size of the samples so that i would not fill up before orderingmy only regret is not being able to go back and order some of the menu items i was unable to trythe 4 snickerdoodle cookie was a very pleasant surprise,0.0
i always come to this loft when visiting vegas today i came in with the intent to spend 50 to get the loft cash card the customer service i received from the young female manager today definitely makes this my favorite loft  i walked in  she greeted me and explained the specials in the store today and if i made a 50 purchase ill receive two 25 loft cash cards to use for a future purchase in june i told her that i just came from the loft in greenvalley but they only have me 1 25 loft cash card  she asked to see my receipt and gave me another 25 loft can card and corrected my receipt  she checked on me periodically to see if she could assist me i was intent on only spending 50 to get cash cards  and she helped me to calculate and to find the color and sizes i needed  she was always so happy to assist  im glad i came here today  ill be back on june 1 to spend my loft cash cards,0.0

this place is not an equal opportunist sad to say that i have fallen down for the first time in my 47 years of life i have gotten in trouble and i have a felony but its the lowest one and its not for anything violent or sexual this place stated they do not discriminate against that and it is not a disqualification for having one yet i was told i did not pass the background check i have 9 years with motorola and 13 years with the sheriffs dpt so i know the only thing in my background is the felony its a shame this corporation does not believe in 2nd chances and they could even receive a tax break for hiring me too i wish someone would believe in second chances my family needs me more then ever,0.0

the hotel was under construction and i was awoken at 700 am to hammers and power tools  i changed rooms to be put in another room that had excessive construction noise as well  i then changed rooms again to one that was finally quite  of the 4 or 5 staff members i spoke with most could care less and simply said they werent supposed to make noise until 900 am  i also had a few bug bites on me from my stay which makes me a bit worried also there were resort fees in the fine print of my resrvation and even though mine said the fitness center was included in the resort fees they told me that was a mistake and would not honor itmy only positive was the pool was decent  i still would never stay there again,0.0
we started out with several italian appetizers like meatballs bruschetta calamari and they were great we then had the polpo alla griglia which was outstanding wonderful spiciness of the sauce and mellow tartness of castelvetrano olives i think  paired with the la meirana gavi i could have eaten just this for dinner but there was more to come the fileto de manza with the brandy cream reduction was amazing especially with the 2013 alves de sousa douro rsv thank you chef and your staff for a memorable evening,1.0
