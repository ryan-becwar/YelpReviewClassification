393646,Got the breakfast sandwich with home fries both of which were great. Only reason I didn't give 4 stars is slow service as the place was busy and the ice coffee was just ok slightly watery,3

I booked a large group here for my Wedding Rehearsal dinner. I wanted something that had a private-ish area for our group, but had character and good food!

We ended up booking an area downstairs with tall bar tables and stools. There were also other private dining rooms you can book out as well. When I was planning this, it was super easy. They have a $30 per person set menu that comes with an antipasto plate with appetizers and cured meats and cheeses. Then I could choose from their menu any pizza I wanted which they will determine the number that are made and come out based on 3-4 slices a person. 
It also includes dessert which they also determined on the day, but there was TONS of food and LOTS of leftovers. 
I could also pre-order wine which was a great suggestion as then with the group people could just state ""white"" or ""red"" and it was ready to go. You only pay for what you drink. 

The servers were friendly, and was really good at adjusting the price based on the number of people that did not show up. 
I loved that the resto was able to overall just make you pay for what you eat without over charging. 

I've never been to Libretto before, but love that they have unique pizza choices, all that were very good. My favourite was the Spicy Sausage pizza. (as opposed to the house made sausage). The Duck Confit was good too but didn't have enough taste for me. 
For apps, they gave us a bunch of food, but the most memorable was the Gnocchi and we couldn't stop eating it. 
For dessert, we got the infamous tiramisu which was amazing.

There is also an option for Spelt Crust!",5
5084035,AMAZING!! I got a reasonable quote and they came the next day.   Not only did they pick up my junk but they swept up any debris around the area.   Very professional and friendly.   Will use them again for sure.,5

I'm not a tea expert. I don't own a diffuser. I prefer my tea iced and plain because, frankly, I'm sweet enough. 

In search of the ever elusive 'thoughtful' Christmas gift for my picky sister I stopped in at Fleur de Teas in the hopes of finding something special. I wasn't disappointed. 

The shop, located next to the Phoenix City Grille, is small and cozy. Don't let the size fool you, this small spot is bursting at the seams with a huge variety of tea, tea accessories and beauty products. 

The staff was friendly and very helpful, walking me through several different varieties of tea until I found exactly what I was looking for. Needless to say, the gift was a hit (and very reasonably priced). 

I'm not a tea expert, but Fleur de Teas makes me want to be. I'll be back!",4
173185,I have been going here for years and expect a student massage. Last week I went because I was in so much back pain. I got lucky and had Willie Reese as my student therapist. He hit so many tiger points I was pain free all week. I returned this week for 2 hours with Willie and OMG.....painfully but very rewarding. I have never been treated better. I am out of pain!!!!!,5
2493564,"First off let me start with 50 stars for Savino. Here's my story: so I had an account with cox for 8 years. During this time it was a constant bill goes up every year and you have to call and fight your way down to where you were before. I got to the point where their ""loyalty dept"" could no longer work with me as I was an ""existing client"". I was told they could no longer offer me promotions. After 8 years really?? So I cancelled my service. After a month of homework on other company's I found out they have a monopoly in Las Vegas and pretty much are the only good internet company here. Basically we are in their hands.
I spoke to an IT friend and he recommended me buying my own modem and router, then going to just connect service. I went in and explained my situation. Savino was very nice and understanding of the hell I just went through with their company. Not only did he manage to reconnect my service, but gave me a way better deal then their stupid ""loyalty dept"". Please save yourself the headache of calling and come in to speak to these guys. They seem to have more brain and customer service than their whole ""loyalty dept"" put together. Great job team!!",3
3846675,"Just returned from a fabulous anniversary trip to Las Vegas. We booked a fountain view room at the Bellagio and we were not disappointed, the lady at check in asked if we had a preference for floor and we told her to give us the best in her opinion, so we were placed on the 28th floor. The elevators are a thrill ride, LOL ZOOOOM! We walked in the room and WOW! The Eiffel tower at the Paris and the entire fountain area like a postcard!
 Best room I have every had in Vegas. Comfy bed and pillows, very clean and fully stocked (but pricey) mini bar. LOL, But vending and ice was just up the hall. 
Casino was fun. better class of folks for the most part, but still a party atmosphere. Actually didnt do too bad and came home with winnings! 
WE do tip well, so we had some really good bell & valet service. Really not sure why anyone would complain, unless nothing pleases them. It was one of the best experiences I have had traveling, and the place is JUST GORGEOUS!! The flowers alone are worth the visit! 
The resort is not for folks who want to get stupid and loud, head to hard Rock if thats your thing. It does have that high end elegance that many casinos and hotels are missing in town.
Also if you LOVE high end shopping ( even if its just the window variety) you can spend a day inside and around the resort. its located in a fun spot on the strip. The money they didnt get at slots I spent at Giardini for beautiful Italian ceramics! Better than a cheap T-shirt, LOL.
Then there is Jean Phillipes Patisserie, with the giant chocolate fountain. Not just decadent sweets, but great Panini and crepes for lunch, and we made it our go to for coffee and Brioche for breakfast. Grab something and go sit by the pool with the paper ( Only for guests) .
Awesome dinner on your checklist? We chose Le Cirque at the Bellagio.  If French food is your thing,and you like to dress to impress, its one of the best. The service was amazing, the decor & the plates were wonderful and the food Gourmet. They helped me arrange a surprise for our anniversary and presented the table with a Beautiful cake from Jean Phillipes in our anniversary colors! 5 star+ to their whole team!!
I cant wait to return again!!!",5

The lean beef Pho was tasty and hearty, with a light broth.  The dish came with a fried spring roll and a nice side salad (with traditional dressing) that was tangy and bright.  We also shared a crab Rangoon appetizer.  They were small and served with the same dipping sauce (sweet chili) as the spring rolls.

Pleasant and attentive servers, along with a steaming bowl of soup made for a very comforting meal.",4

2293919,"I am big on Food Safety and when I see food safety violations (especially when someone else is cooking my food), I feel propelled to say something. I stopped by here and placed my order. The female taking my order called another employee over who was on the line cooking the food to help her with a cash register issue. The employee stop making the food, walked over and started handling the money and pressing buttons on the cash register. I ordered through the drive through so I can see how nasty the monitor was on the cash register. 

The female that finished handling the cash register issues went back to make the food without exchanging gloves. I said something immediately and to my surprise the original cashier clerk defended her action as if she was scared to correct her. This happens in the workplace a lot. People see others violating rules and dont say anything to ""keep the peace"". 
I was sooo mad, I told the cashier ""Forget it"" I dont want this food and drove off not even negotiating my refund. 

I have eaten here many of time and had great experiences. I just had to post this so the whomever is in charge can round up the employees and remind them about Food Safety and not be to lazy to wash their hands or change gloves when touching other things away from the food prepping line.

4583209,"Not sure why there are so many negative reviews here. Let me point out a few things that matter when you enter a brand store like Canada Goose.
1. The material and the offerings this brand has for Winter wear is of no match to any other brand and hence the price does all the justice. It comes with a 10 year warranty, what else would you need.
2. Such stores are always jam packed and its very difficult for any sales associate to handle multiple at the same time. Yes, even if you deploy a soldier of sales men, its not enough for such a store
3. What they offer is promising and  they do no compromise on quality or safety when it comes to winter wear.
4. The sales associate 'Luna' was super sweet to us. Though it was the peek of season and super busy, she was kind enough to answer every question and took time to explain every detail of the varieties they had at the store.
I do not need to recommend this brand to anyone. Those who own this know the worth of it. It is indeed a life time investment worth every penny.",5
3560831,"**Check out Dollar Mountain!** (located in the back of the store) 

I happened upon this store while on a ""book quest"" during my stay in Phoenix in July 2013. I am a huge supporter of independently owned book stores, so I was really excited to find this gem. Though it's pretty small in comparison to some of the other indie shops I've been too, this book store has a pretty awesome selection of books. 

All the sections and shelves are well organized so books are easy to find. At the register, there is a glass showcase that holds some first editions, and even some autographed copies as well. 

The owner was very friendly, and extremely helpful. They were running some awesome specials as well. There are several tables at the front of the store where any of the books you find or select are only $2 each. I got several hardcover books (used) in EXCELLENT condition for $2 each. There are a few new books scattered throughout as well, but this store specializes in USED. IF you go to the back of the store, you'll find ""Dollar Mountain"", which is a HUGE stack of books that are all $1. Awesome deal!

So, when I was in this store, I asked the owner: ""What happens to the hundreds of books you get in that don't sell? Do you toss them? Recycle them?"" His reply: ""Some I do send off to be recycled into new paper for new books, but I primarily donate them to the troops overseas in Afghanistan and Iraq.""--That answer alone inspired me to make a hefty purchase. We need more stores and people like this to stay in business. These businesses are great for the community. 

I'd highly recommend this store should you ever be in the Phoenix area!",4
2359989,"This is one of my favorite restaurants.  I have been there numerous times since they've opened and the food has always been delicious and the service has been outstanding.  The bruschetta board, Tomasos meatballs, house made pasta and sauce are my go to items.  The cocktails are fabulous as well.  Most recently I sat outside at the bar with my friend and Nicole the bartender was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  I will be back for sure!",5
826059,"I discovered Las Vegas ATV Tours via Groupon and read some of the mixed (but mostly good) review via Trip Advisor and Yelp.  Overall, it seemed like everyone was super happy with their tour.

Communication is a little spotty at times, but mainly because it's a mom and pop kind of business and everyone works in that joint.  After a tour is when these guys respond to your emails and phone calls.  

We signed up for the One Hour Tour.  John picked us up from The Four Seasons Hotel along with other folks from different hotels on the strip and we headed towards the Motor Speedway where they dropped us off next to the Airforce base.  It's about a 30 mins drive. To begin with, I have never driven an ATV before, but I owned a scooter for seven years and have driven a motorcycle, so I am well aware of how to dress on a moving vehicle.  However, a few of the gals did not.  

Girls - be smart, not stupid.  Wear pants and choose the morning session in the summer.  It's simply too hot to do this tour in the middle of the afternoon.  You'll die.  Second, wear moisture wicking clothes as you will sweat and pour water all over your body.  Bring a light long sleeved shirt.  The sun is strong and no matter how much sunscreen you apply, you'll be thankful for the coverage when the wind picks up and sand is blowing onto your bare arms.  Second, wear old tennis shoes. Not TOMS, not Keds, not sandals.  Again, don't be an idiot, you are in the desert on a 4-wheeler.  The pedals have metal prongs and you need protection from the heat of the engine.

Last, bring a small backpack filled with water, extra sunscreen, ibuprofen, kleenex (i.e. toilet paper), chapstick and a bandana.  While the group gives you a water during the half time break, they only bring enough water for one bottle per person.  It's hot outside and the heat definitely got to me.  I wish I would have brought extra water and a bandana to cover my mouth from all the dirt.

Now, onto the tour.  I thought it was amazing.  The guys are tatted up, smoke and good ole' boys - they know what they are doing.  They did a great job describing what we would be doing and the hand signals to follow.  They also had extra riders to round up the caboose and let the girls ride tandem in the event they were too scared to drive an ATV.  They warm you up with an easy start filled with small bumps and hills.  As you become more comfortable with the ATV,  you  have the option to be more aggressive as you trust the machine over time.  They definitely make it clear to do whatever you feel most comfortable with and they never make you feel stupid for taking it slow and careful.  They know the area like the back of their dry, tan hands and do their job well.

Honestly, a one hour would have sufficed for me, as it's hot and physically exhausting, but we winded up riding two hours.  I'm not complaining, it was great fun, but for a retreat recreation I am planning in September, I would recommend to my older clients to perhaps consider just an hour as it is very physically demanding.  Also, your gas is in what looks like a gear shift on your right handle bar, it's a lot of strain to your right hand - it doesn't work like a motorcycle.  So be prepared for some terrible texting, post tour.

I winded up flying over a ""Witch's Eye"" and into a dune, causing me to almost flip over the handlebars.  I didn't, but winded up jamming my right thigh into the throttle and right handlebar.  It left a nasty bruise, cut and whiplash, but it was all worth it.  The staff was great - they made sure I was OK, gave me water and asked several times if I wanted to stop and go back.  I assured them I was OK, and while I definitely felt it the next day...and today...I am still so happy I did the tour.  It was great to get out into the desert, out of the strip, see the jets fly above you and meet some new people. I definitely would recommend this group and Casey as your guide.  To make this trip more enjoyable - be prepared, not a dumb-ass.

Lunch is provided afterwards and the team is eager to take group photos.  If you are ever in Vegas and looking for something different to do, give them a a call and go in the morning!",5
4954984,"Just ordered my pizza and I have a good feeling about it. I work in the area and craved a slice of pizza so I took to the world of Yelp for recommendations. They have good reviews on Yelp and they were just a couple miles up the road, so I gave it a shot. The lady at the counter has a New York or Jersey accent (I can't tell them apart, sorry). I told her it was my first time and she helped me make a decision (bc I'm indecisive) and I made my own creation. She saw that I had a Yelp coupon for checking in. She happily took it and I just paid the difference bc I the coupon was for a free slice of cheese pizza with a drink. She didn't have to accept my coupon but she did any way. While writing this my pizza came out and my order was called. I went up there and boy does it look good. I'm looking at it as I type. I'm taking my first bite!... I just ate half of it before continuing my review. It is delicious! I'm so lucky I found a pizza joint close to work and home. The prices are low especially for the quality. Definitely coming here again! Sorry, pizza trumps Yelp today and I'm hangry!",5

The service was very good, though not worth  the mandatory 24% gratuity (we had 10 in our party hence the mandatory gratuity) The pizza was good. Good not great... Not average, just not 'wow'. There are so many boutique pizza joints in the valley, and they are all good, I just didn't find anything unique about Cibo's besides the complex Italian naming scheme. We had a big group and they packed us in to a back room with another large group... That's fine, but the acoustics are horrible and it was very hard to hear or carry on a conversation. Regardless, I'll go back, even if only for a glass of wine and dessert but wait until the fall to enjoy their big outdoor dining area.",3

We thought...5 minutes...let's get all 8 pieces fresh. WRONG!!! So many appendages in my chicken. Ew...The batter was crumbly, in a bad way and the chicken was super dry, like beef jerky.

I complained, an of course nothing was done. Yet my credit has inquiry's on it though.

2605868,I really like this place! I like how you can try as many flavors as you want until you get to that one you want to commit to. I had passion fruit which was delish! If you can get over the sketchy location then you won't be disappointed!,5
5150367,"I have been on a search for good soft serve for a couple months when I found out about Tom's Dairy Freeze. I was skeptical because I thought ""just how good can soft serve get?"". I was wrong.

The very BIG ""medium"" cone dipped in chocolate that I got almost brought tears to my eyes. Not simply because it was creamy, delicious, melty and amazing but because it reminded me of my childhood. When I was a kid (I grew up in Russia), we went to Moscow and got a chocolate covered ice cream bar. It was almost identical taste to the soft serve cone dipped in chocolate that I got at Tom's. 

Beware: the ice cream (perhaps because it's real cream and not modified milk ingredient slush) melts REALLY fast. The chocolate was almost falling off my cone. It was so worth it though. I got twist flavour but next time I am going for vanilla alone for the purity of it.

Also, their sizes are generous. A medium really is a large. I've seen people with a large and it is HUGE. I recommend starting off with a small unless you're really sure you want a LOT of soft serve.

I would highly recommend Tom's to anyone who's looking for either good soft serve or good old fashioned ice cream in general.",5

Courtney was understanding and moved our reservations.   We were greeted by Courtney and gave us a choice of two tables.

Remember, I am a fatboy trapped in a skinny mans body.  He promised I wouldn't be disappointed.

As we pulled up to Windsor, my first impression as we walked in the door was WOW.  I feel in love with the way the place was set up.  As we sat down, a friendly waitress came and took our drink and appetizer order.  She brought the drinks but she never brought the appetizers.  Then she came back and took our order.  She brought out our food but never brought out the appetizers.  We asked about the appetizers and she said she was so sorry and brought over her manager.  The manager told us she was sorry for the mishap and would comp our bill $17.00 since they forgot to put in our appetizers.  I couldn't believe this place.  It was like heaven.

I'd recommend it and even take a girl on a date there.",4
1095404,"Convenient location, great customer service, and delicious food. Only bad thing I have to say about this place is it's very pricey (I got the Bison Bowl- which was amazing- but was about $16) You can definitely tell they use quality ingredients and it's super convenient after the gym when you don't have time to prepare your meals, but a little hard for me to spend almost $20 on a bowl for lunch.",4

4511101,This is such a cool place to bring the kids downtown.  I used to always wonder what the inside of this old building looked like and now that they have made this into a museum for kids I have been able to check out the whole inside.  They have lots of stuff for the kids inside and out.  They have special hours when the kids are out of school so check online for that before you head out.,5
42649,"Food was okay, servers were nice but need more experience or should pay more attention to diners needs. There is one white male (owner?) helping out  every time i go to this place this person always wear a printed T-shirt which  doesn't  create a warm welcoming gesture to the diners. This guy should change his attire or just stay inside the kitchen. Sometime you get pandesal if they remember. One time i ordered a bulalo the server said it doesn't come with rice because it is categorized as soup. I know the place is new and will need a lot of changes and adjustments but right now i rate this place one star.",1
1999305,"For a chain restaurant...I was impressed. We stopped in early in a Saturday and were told it would be a 50min wait but bar seating was first come first served. We decided to look around and found a table in the back corner of the bar. It took a little bit but our server finally came over and took our drink order. He was very knowledgeable with the wine list and my wife went with one of his suggestions for a Pinot Grigio and she enjoyed it. I couldn't decide on an entree so I went with some small plates. I started with the lobster bisque which was flavorful but skimpy on the lobster. Next I had a Caesar salad and an order of calamari. The salad was rather large and a good value. The calamari was excellent except for the aioli. I tried a little and decided to stick with the marinara that accompanied it. I'm a calamari traditionalist...what can I say? My wife had the pasta Brio which consisted of rigatoni, grilled chicken, and mushrooms in a roasted red pepper sauce. She liked it and so did I. I'm not a huge fan of chains but Brio does it right. We will definitely be back the next time we decide to visit Crocker Park.",4

Some prices are a bit too high yet just as many and maybe more are surprisingly low.  I'm definitely a fan and it's great that they offer daily half price promotions and that the money the store earns goes toward a good cause.  3$ off coupon if you donate (anything) and a stamp card where once you fill it up you get 30% off your entire purchase.

4817323,"What drew me into this store was the absolutely gorgeous display of lamps and hanging light pendants made of glass set in mosaic design.

The owner is an importer of home decor goods primarily from Turkey, Iran and India.  
In addition to the lamps there are brightly colored hand-painted ceramics like bowls and platters which we were were told are done in traditional Ottoman Empire designs.

There are inlaid and carved pieces of furniture and some beautiful carpets.  
If I were to build a Riyad-style Moroccan house, this is where I'd come to accessorize it.

Toward the front of the store I spotted several jewelry cases.  What caught my attention in particular were the pieces of evil eye jewelry.  There were pendants, bracelets, earrings, sun-catchers; evil eye repellers all.

There are many cultures that believe in the necessity of warding off the evil eye.  I come from two of those cultures and I grew up on stories about the ""malocchio"". It wasn't unusual to see someone wearing a gold horn (cornuto) necklace. 

In this shop I purchased the Turkish version of an Evil Eye pendant which is in the shape of an eye.  It's made in Swarovski crystal mosaic.  What I'd tell you if you'd ask, is that I love the way it looks.    But what I'd also like to believe is that it might be giving me a little extra protection to get through the day.

Great shop, with lots to see both for decorating yourself or your house.",4
4937171,"We came here for lunch on a weekday around 11:45 and almost all the tables were occupied. I ordered the kale and arugula salad with shrimp, and it was pretty good considering I never usually order salads at restaurants. I do wish the dressing came on the side; the leaves were almost too drenched. However the shrimp was cooked perfectly and the parsnips and radishes added a nice bitterness and crunch. The cornbread that came with it was amazing as well. I tried a few bites of the shrimp and grits though and instantly wished I had ordered that instead - SO GOOD and had more than just shrimp and grits. So if I ever come back I know what I'm getting. 

The staff were all nice and so is the atmosphere and decor. A bit pricey, but within reason and well worth it.",4

1536277,"I went by there to watch a Panthers game and the whole experience was pretty sub-par. For one, the area we were seated in was right below some speakers and they had the cranked up to 11 and we just about had to yell constantly to have conversation. It was kinda interesting in a way because after a while people just kinda subconsciously gave up on conversation and by the end of the evening a few of us were just sitting there quietly. Anyways, along with our drinks we ordered a pretty good assortment of ""bar"" type food. Sandwiches, wings, chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks, fried pickles, french fries, nachos and even pizza. I sampled a little bit of everything just about since we were all doing a communal snacking type deal and I think the only thing that was even borderline decent was the mini chicken tenders. The nachos had some kind of cheese whiz type sauce which tasted like it was from a jar. I think they brought us 6 or so mozzarella sticks and at least two of them didn't even have any cheese in them. The fried pickles were the soggiest incarnation I've ever tasted and the both the pizza and chicken sandwich were greasy. Overall it was just a crummy meal. They do seem to have a very good drink selection though and a full bar even though the drinks are a little overpriced. If I could say one good thing about the place it is that the wait staff seemed very friendly and was on top of their game. Our server didn't mess anything up and kept all our drinks filled. Another funny note was that the guys running the food to the tables seemed to be clueless as can be. Not only did we get our food but they tried at least 3 additional times to bring us other peoples orders. It's like they had no idea where they were supposed to take the orders.",2

Michelle was our wedding coordinator on the day of the wedding and she was fabulous and so helpful, as was Tony. All of our guests raved about the food and the lighting was wonderful for photos.

For starters the apartment building was built in the late 60's cool I like old buildings and the design of that time, but that doesn't mean that everything had to still be from that time inside. Everything is from the 60's and 70's down to the carpets that is missing in most closets. The ""updated"" tile that they where so proud to tell us about turned out to be Vinyl rolled out to look like tiles....the kitchen flooring is totally coming up from the faulty dishwasher also. Everything just looks dirty and dingy. Not only is everything inside the apartment out of date, but then the hallways haven't seen the light of anything new for a while, correction most hallways the main lobbies have just been freshened with a new coat of trim paint.....went from dingy blue to some type of aqua green stuff that looks like the 80's meet the 70's and decided Miami needed to be invited in....the worst thing of all have been the thefts from Amador every package that we have had to have delivered, I have had to replace almost every order we have ordered here due to the lovely neighbors helping themselves to packages left in door ways.... basically don't move here the only positive is the price but like they say you get what you pay for....",1

The place appears to serve desserts, coffee, and wine (not sandwiches/bread).  They don't open very early (11:00 am) and stay open up into the evening.  It would be a nice place for a casual date, conversation with friends, or an after movie/theatre/church snack. The owners might have come up with a nice niche for their business and hopefully it works because the desserts appear awesome.

The  service was very friendly and the pastry I  had (chocolate brownie/chocolate chip cookie) were really yummy.  The pastry looked like super quality stuff and from what I saw prices ranged from about $3 for cookies/brownies to $4 for very unique macarons to about $7 for very high-end cake desserts.  The more pricey desserts looked big enough to share with a date, spouse, or significant other.

The shop has about ten tables and is nicely decorated and clean.  It has a classy-artsy-bistro feel but is mellow with cool music.  It's tucked away in the corner of a strip mall at 215 and Stephanie, but it is not hard to find.",5

The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. Even after the first visit we had a few questions about a minor change in our dog's condition and Dr. Flick herself called us back in a timely manner. I was surprised at that alone because usually you hear ""bring them in, we can't diagnose over the phone"". The Dr. called us back in a timely manner  and reassure us she would be fine!!

It is in a strip mall but it would not be a Saturday night date choice.  It is all tables with nothing, not sure if it meant something but a car painted on the wall.  Let's make it look Itallian.

Talking about polite, Marie and Theresa are the two individuals who I prefer to deal with, out of anybody, working here, but if they are not there, anyone will do, but those two ladies are super awesome!

So before, there once use to be several Whataburgers locations closer to where I lived. That is no longer the case and I am a sad panda.  I always order a #2 (Double meat Whataburger), add cheese, extra pickles, extra onions and extra mustard on the bun! I feel those three things help perfectly clash with each other so I can fully savor the meat and the overall meal. The staff never even judges me or gripes about me wanting all the extra stuff. 

The fries, always crisp and golden and not too salty, but enough salt to have with the ""Fancy Ketchup"" ! I always grab extra ""fancy ketchup"" here to take home with me.

Onion rings taste sooooooooooooooo good. Add some ranch for 30 some cents, and yep.. 


Inside, like I said, clean.. but they play 50s-60s music, and it is music I grew up listening to, so I like the ambiance! 

What I like is that I can go in at the 3am and sit down and my food is cooked just as fresh as if I ordered it at 2pm! This place is open 24 hours so this place is legendary in my book. Yes, I said it, LEGENDARY!

89296,"I visited Elmwood Spa with my mom for Mother's Day and overall we had a good experience. We had lunch first, following which I had a manicure and pedicure and my mom had a facial and manicure. Lunch was pretty good - nothing special but nothing to really complain about either. My mom really enjoyed her facial and said her esthetician was very skilled, knowledgeable and happy to answer a few questions that she had. I was a bit disappointed by the manicure and pedicure facilities. There are quite a few stations (almost too many for the room) which feel kind of squished together. The chairs aren't particularly comfy - there are no massage armchairs here. The room was also quite noisy and difficult to relax in. The quality of both my manicure and pedicure wasn't quite as good as I was expecting for a spa. Considering Elmwood charges significantly more than Nailsense, which I usually visit to get my nails done, I wasn't blown away. 

The customer service was quite good and everyone was friendly and helpful. The facilities are also nice and very clean. Overall, I would visit Elmwood spa again for other services, just not to get my nails done as I'm not sure its worth the steep price.",3

The place was super packed when we got there, they only had the bar and high top tables available at the moment. The bar was actually super nice so we got seated there. 

We were immediately greeted by our server Nicole, sick tattoos btw. I've asked her about their mimosas and she said there were different types of mimosas that they can make. She listed them all and introduced this blueberry lavender mimosa that was pureeeeeeeee delicious and amazing. It was definitely something that we both haven tried before. The taste of it was just amazing and perfect for brunch. 

I've ordered the eggs Benedict and my best friend ordered the crab cake Benedict's. The food came super quickly and I was super impressed at how our server kept checking up on us and even filling up our cups with water without disturbing us! 

Let's talk food. My eggs Benedict was amaaaaaaazing. Delicious, I wish they were more generous with the hollandise sauce but overall it was great. The smashed potatoe hash browns were sooooo perfect. Crispy, hot and soft in the inside. I loved how they also saut√©ed other veggies with the hash. It was delicious. I think I would get the crab cake Benedict's next time, my friend said it was amazing and something she has never ordered before. 

When I asked for the bill, Nicole our server totally surprised us with a birthday treat for my friend. We were so awed with the surprise that it totally made our day. Plus we would definitely be coming back just to snack on those donuts. It was pure goodness.

Do NOT go to Scott if you want to lay on a table and get rubbed for a while. It's not about relaxation. Your body is your temple and all that, but it's also a machine, and if the pulleys and levers are out of place/sync/whack, then no amount of epsom salt and meditation is going to cure what ails ya. Just like how you gotta work out to get stronger, you gotta work on your injuries to make them better.

I spend a very large portion of my life either rock climbing or hiking somewhere to film someone else rock climbing. The rest of my life is spent behind a computer, seated, in what is possibly the most unhealthy bodily configuration for someone with chronically tight forearms, upper arms, chest, and back. Add to that some chronic elbow tendonitis (or -osis, whatever), a hectic schedule living on the road, and you have a recipe for a bundle of chronic pain and limited mobility.

I keep most of this crap at bay with self-therapy, but that only goes so far. It feels like vacuuming the kitchen floor, when really, it needs a mop.

Scott is that mop.

In 90 minutes, he took my forearm extensors to the bone, gave 'em some active release....from typing, my pronators are as taut as a piano string. He isolated those bastards and gave 'em what for. The back, neck, and shoulder work was incredible, as I could open my chest afterward...which is rare for those of us with hypertrophied backs who rarely use our pushing muscles.

It was New Year's Day and my friend and I were looking for a place to watch the Rose Bowl. I called Biaggio's to make sure they'd be open and he said they'd switch the channel to whatever we wanted to watch.

When we got there, Biaggio somehow recognized me from Yelp. He knew I was the one who ended up backing out of the CMYE. Wow! For someone who claims to not be all that internet-savvy, he sure does keep a finger on the pulse of social media.

Long story short, my friend ordered an Italian Stromboli and I had a Pastrami Stromboli. We didn't realize how huge they would be, so we added some Garlic Knots for good measure. The Garlic Knots were extremely moist and doughy on the inside. And they're huge! But nowhere near as huge as the Strombolis. Even with a 3-hour game, there was no way we'd be able to eat all that food. Oh and yes, the Strombolis were all they were hyped up to be. I personally like the Pastrami over the Italian and my friend concurs. So delicious.

With our Strombolis only half eaten, the food coma was setting in and we decided to leave at half time. Biaggio stops us and says we have some Fried Dough on the way. Um. OK. How can you turn down free food from such a generous man? Of course, the Fried Dough was awesome. It's basically pizza dough topped with butter, cinnamon, and powdered sugar. It smelled really sweet, but it was surprisingly mellow. We had a few pieces and added the rest to our to-go boxes.

It goes without saying that I'll be coming back. I need to try the Chicken Wings that everyone is raving about. Also, when I mentioned that my boss loves pastrami, he offered to send us a Pastrami Stromboli when I return to work on Monday. Now that is the epitome of generosity! (I'll be sure to supplement that with my own order of Chicken Wings).

4441378,"The Argus Bar is a place which most Madison residents know about, many have visited, and and a lesser number have (at one time or another) made it their regular go-to among the myriad of downtown bars on the Isthmus.  The Argus has been around for over two decades, and has changed relatively little in that time.  It's vibe can change dramatically, depending on the time of day, type of demographic inside, and other factors which are less predictable.  Think of it as the bar version of that person you used to date who had many mercurial moods, but always wore the same clothes.  Lunch may be the most benign time there, when laconic patrons and downtown employees take advantage of the wide variation of menu and drink choices.  What to order off the menu could occupy a review in itself, but suffice it to say that there are rewards and choices which are problematic.  On a recent visit, I was a little short of cash and thought a humble burger would be a good compromise at $5.75.  While a 1/3 lb. patty is the standard offering, and lettuce, tomato and slivers of red onion, along with condiments are served without additional charge, the final result is about as inspired as retired CPA.  Other more successful offerings include their Reuben, different salads, wraps, and decent chicken sandwiches.  Drink menu is complete and the pours are healthy.  For proof, just check the clientele at closing time on the weekends, when the place becomes a loud and unapologetic hot mess for young people to either celebrate their tinder conquests or just get hammered like a good Wisconsin citizen.  Regardless of your take on the place, it will likely be here longer than you.",3

3878698,"Today was our first trip to Zipps in Phoenix.  We used to go to the one in Scottsdale on a weekly basis, but they have been doing really bad on their health inspections.  

I ordered a beer and appetizer at 4:50.  By 5:52, we still haven't seen our server to order dinner.  I had to walk up to the bar to get another beer.  The server stopped by to take our order at 6:00.  It's 6:53 and she hasn't been back.  This will be our last trip to Zipps.",1

I recommend the flights and the IPA as well as the jalape√±o Mac and Cheese.  Service was very helpful in making recommendations and knowledgeable about the beers and menu.",5
5219388,"Located in Terminal 4 of Sky Harbor Airport (just outside of security before heading down escalator to baggage claim) is a convenient place to stop when you get off of that early a.m. flight and had not yet had a bite to eat. 

Bagels, spreads, breakfast and deli sandwiches. 

While the service wasn't slooow, the people who work there are definitely confused. I had to pay three separate times since they kept forgetting to ring items up. Bagel. Check. Special spread, oh I didn't get that. Check. Bottle of water, you wanted that too? Oh, now I ran out of dimes, I'll be right back (BTW, in case you didn't know, 2 nickles = 1 dime or 10 pennies = 1 dime).

2737940,"Always love Portillo's beef and Chicago style hotdogs but while in the area stopped by this location and wanted something different. Tried the lasagne. Not doing that again! Close to 10 bucks with tax I got a bowl with a lump of pasta literally swimming in sauce, I mean it floated! I told the guy I didn't order chili and he just shrugged and pointed to some parmesian sprinkle cheese, as if that would make it authentic. I almost spilled the sauce as I walked to my table asit slopped from side to side. Topping it off; a 2x2 piece of bread with a hardened butter packet. You'd think with all those lovely Italian rolls for the beef, they could spare a little more than the butt. It then dawned on me, this is what they cut off before making their signature Italian beef. Pity! I'd suggest sticking with the signature instead of scribbling something and calling it lasagne. Don't waste your $$$. Get a BIG BEEF and let it dribble down your arms as you delight in its grandeur.",2
2396356,"Pullman is a place you have to choose to go. It's not on the way to anywhere, and it's not close to anything else particularly. Consequently, It took me a long time to get round to going. But I loved it.

The decor is chic and comfortable, but not pretentious in any way. It attracts an eclectic clientele, with a wide range of ages. The music is present, and reasonably loud, but not so you have to shout, or even pay much attention to it (I really can't remember what was playing). It's the sort of place you can dress up to go, but at the same time, you won't feel under-dressed in jeans. (I wouldn't go in sports clothes though.) My only concern was that it is a tad on the dark side, which makes it difficult to read the tiny-printed menu when you're over 40... 

The tapas-style food offerings are top quality. I tried the gravlax, the beet and feta salad, (served together), the charcuterie platter, and the beans in truffle oil, (also served together, which made for great marriages). There was plenty for two.

I had a yen for pinot noir, but was struggling with the very long wine list. The servers are billed as sommeliers, and definitely seem to know their wines. Ours suggested one I'd been hesitating over, but it turned out to be unavailable. She offered an excellent substitute at an even better price, so we ended up having two bottles! :-)

I don't know why it took me so long to get here. I think I feared it would be pretentious and disappointing, but honestly I found it exactly the sort of place I've been looking for for a while.",5
4069562,"I have been here several times with my parents. I want to like it so bad. It is close to them, and has so much potential. The views and setting are beautiful. The facility is nice and clean. I keep trying it but still get the same results.

I think my biggest problem is the menu. I am not sure they know quite what they are going for. Are they catering for the tastes of the local trilogy patrons? Kind of, but then they try to fancy it up and make it super gourmet but it doesn't work. The food is like the girl at the party who just tries too hard. She seems like she has everything right, but there is just something off about her, especially when you look at her closely. The food all sounds really good on the menu, but when it comes out it is just heavy. They seem to rely more on the use of heavy creams and butters to try and make the dish taste good instead of seasonings. I cannot find anything on the menu that I like. I tried the salmon- it was very dry. They do not have a wide selection of salads  that appeal to me either.  The Caesar is just ok. I did not like the asian salad. My dad loves the wedge salad though. I also did not like the flavor of the french onion soup.  My husband always gets the macaroni and cheese. It is good, but again very heavy and he always gets a stomach ache. I do eat a little seafood, but there are no vegetarian options under the entre section. 

We also came here for cinco de mao. It adverstised an all you can eat mexican buffet. It was pretty terrible. The churros were rock hard and inedible. The rest of the food was mediocre and limited. 

We did come for Easter brunch and it was excellent. I would do that again in a heartbeat. That was the only time i have been truly happy here. 

I guess the menu just needs to be revamped to include lighter, healthier, more organic fair if they want to charge the higher prices. 

Also, they have live music a lot on the patios and leave the doors open. I know a lot of people there are hard of hearing, and they cannot have a conversation because the music is so loud.",2
2917136,"We stayed here from 12/19/2008 to 12/23/2008.  Being from Chicago, luxury and elegance was something sought in a Las Vegas style hotel.

From the time we entered the lobby and entered our room we were beyond pleased.

We just knew we were going to wait until 3pm to check in, since we arrived at 11 a.m., so in this sense we were prepared, but Mandalay made sure we were settled in by 11:15!

We ate at the buffet (not my first choice anywhere), and again were pleasantly surprised from the decor of the hotel, to the choice of food selection, not your everyday buffet.

You are connected to the luxor and excabilur, which we discovered after $100's in cabs.  We would stay here again, but would like something more central!

Highly recommended for those that want a low key environment, and great restaurants.",4
1463420,"We had the tasting menu and it was a feast, we spent the next day biking to burn all the calories. 

Everything was delicious; flavourful and delicately spiced. It was an effort afterwards to try to pick a favourite, but the kibbe nayye was a contender. 

Often with a tasting menu, the dessert is an afterthought and not really worth it; so we were pleasantly surprised that the kunefa (?) a sweet cheese pastry was so good. 

Our host was second generation Syrian and was a delight, his wit and explanations added greatly to our enjoyment of the evening. Would heartily recommend this restaurant.",5
3266606,"waiting on my oil change, i stopped by here mainly because the place looks pretty damn cool. it's like a little ramshackle shed, with lots of shaded seating areas in the back. 

you order at the counter and then pick up in the back. i ordered 3 fish tacos to go and they were ready in less than 10 minutes. and they were only 6 bucks! how cheap!

but they weren't the street taco size...pretty much standard size! and they were loaded with cheese, beans, cabbage, and fish. i was so impressed, i ate all three by myself!

I expected some issues with Course conditions because of overseeding. But they had also ripped up all the irrigation system and there were bare spots all over the fairways. The tee boxes were beat up and the greens were bumpy and inconsistent speeds. 

All that and I still had to pay $55. I probably won't go back--too many other nice courses in the area.",1

1521922,"I bought a Groupon a while back and was very excited to use it but unfortunately it expired before I had a chance to use it. I was very lucky that one of the workers came into my work and we got onto the topic of the business she works for and was super sweet to give me some passes to try them out. 

A few months later I decided to give it a try and was very happy I did. When I got inside I filled out paperwork and we got started on a consultation. The manager, Mariana, was nothing but amazing with me the whole time talking me through every step. She directed me first to the ""Hydration System"" where it steams your body for about 20 minutes. Prior to that I bought into a Stretch Mark cream to put on before, that way when the steam is opening my pores, the cream can insert and help treat my recent marks. First impression would be relaxing. After the 20 minutes, your body feels very hydrated therefore it was worth it!

Then we moved over to the Red Light Therapy where the light helps with the overall health of your skin. It penetrates and helps with fine lines, wrinkles, stretch marks, and even collagen. Although I haven't seen very much of a result quite yet, I do believe her when she says it would take multiple sessions to really improve your overall skin. 

Next I had an automated massage which was all deep tissue and at the same time was having another light therapy on my face and neck. She had me apply a cream (for my acne, which I chose) and it the light helped the cream soak into my skin. Now the day I went in, I came in with no makeup, overall redness, large pores, and tons of acne on my chin. When I woke up the next day, I noticed more than half of that was gone. I was amazed because the cream and light therapy really did improve my face a ton and I would definitely be back to do that one again. 

At the very end, we decided it would be a good idea to try a spray tan (for the first time) because the hydration station helped hydrate my skin and with that, if your skin was dry, the color wouldn't absorb properly and you would probably result patchy. It evenly distributed all over my body and next time might want to go a shade darker now that I know what to expect. 

Overall experience, Mariana was amazing and very easy to talk to through the process and I was really excited she was there to help me out and makes sure I was comfortable. I'll be back!",5
590043,Very good place. Just driving by and found this place . It was very clean and elegant comparing to other ayce sushi places.

Fair price too . Nice atmosphere.  Will go back for Sure.,5

4654958,"What brought me to Fones Gone Wild was that my Galaxy S5 fone had gone wild. Nearing the end of its life, it was more frequently a dark screen when I pressed the power button. This was not cool. I had visited a few shops to inquire about the problem in addition to a factory reset. When I looked up smartphone repair shops on Yelp, the high rating was encouraging. After work I headed to Fones Gone Wild with the expectation that a tech genius could bring my ailing Galaxy S5 back to life. 

   Contrary to the highly rated reviews I have a mixed opinion of Fones Gone Wild. It is a good and bad opinion. The following two paragraphs discuss the good that summarizes the first half of the visit and the bad that summarizes the second half. 

The good:

    After walking into the small shop that is across from UNLV and near Einstein Bagels, I walked passed the display of refurbished phones to where the room dead ended at the service counter. There an older man asked how he can help me. I was a different customer from the majority that walk through the door to replace a screen. The tech genius that I was hoping to bring life back to my phone executed a factory reset on my phone. He carefully opened the Otter Box then displaced the SIM and SD cards. He emphasized if I had everything saved. This was an extraordinary long factory reset. As the Galaxy S5 was erasing everything at a speed slower than molasses, he would gently wipe down the screen. He stated that a factory reset doesn't usually take this long. When the Galaxy S5 finally erased everything, things turned bad. 

The Bad:

   You gotta love technology (sarcastic). As soon as the phone booted up it demanded my Samsung password. The problem is that I had been signing into Google to sign onto the smartphone. Every attempt I made to get into the phone was futile. Now the older man went onto other things. I appreciate the time that he took to reset my phone. Now a younger guy was at the counter. I pressed him on what to do to get into the sign in. He said that there was a way around this where he could get me into my Samsung account. It would cost $65. Talk about being between a rock and a hard place. I work very hard for my money and $65 was a lot of money to get me into my Samsung account. By now he was enthusiastically helping the uptenth customer who walked in the door for a screen repair. I knew of a way to get around the Samsung password block at zero cost. After he placed my SIM card and SD card back into my unresponsive Galaxy S5 that was seriously loosing battery life in the process of a factory reboot, I drove up the street to the Clark County Public Library to use the computer. For the equivalent of the $65 that Fones Gone Wild was going to charge me all I did was go to the Samsung account website where I typed in a couple of personal items and tadah I passed the Samsung sign in. It was so obvious that Fones Gone Wild could of imputed this information on their computer or had let me do it. 

Possibility of a return visit:

  In conclusion when I get my next smartphone, I plan to pay additional for insurance. When the smartphone breaks, I will have the peace of mind that there is a replacement. There is no reason for me to return here.",3
5343664,"I was told the food here was good but service might be lacking. Went in yesterday for lunch and there was a small line and the place was fairly packed so I figure the food at least must be decent. Went through and ordered and paid for our food and grabbed one of the cleaner tables. The condiment containers are all pretty gross. I understand when a place is busy you can't necessarily get everything as sparkling as it maybe should be but the ketchup was dried and caked onto the bottle, that doesn't happen in a short while. Cleanliness aside, our server was pleasant and the food was pretty good. It wasn't the greatest burger and fries I've ever had but it was worth going back for. 

That said, the management/owners seem to treat their staff poorly. I watched several interactions with the servers that made me think this place runs like a prison. Asking for a to-go box became a problem for our server because apparently she had the audacity to give me one of the larger boxes instead of a smaller one. I've never seen so many people chastised for whatever they did wrong, out in the open during a rush. Seeing that turned me off pretty fast and you can see how their behavior changes the demeanor of the servers. Not sure if I'll be back but I doubt it. I can get better food elsewhere and not watch the workers being berated as a side dish.",3
3775322,"Late lunch. Bar crowd and some diners in restaurant. Old fashioned ambiance but fresh and cozy. Ordered off the lunch menu linguine with calamari in marinara.

Calamari in nice sized tubes and so tender!!  Perfection. Very pleasant staff. I will be back!",5

We settled on two dozen wings (garlic parm, and some  type of spicy bbq) a mushroom burger, and a western bacon cheeseburger. The burgers were $5 each, which also included French fries. I believe our total was about $26 for all items. 

We decided to dine in and quickly grabbed a table because they were almost full. There is tons of interesting decore that reminded me that I was in a antique shop. We sat near the bathroom that is right by the front ordering counter. There is package station for leftovers which was helpful because they were busy with customers the whole time we were there. There is also hot sauce and ketchup bottles at the station, a few arcade games and a flat screen tv in the back, and a few trivia card games on a few of the tables.

The food came out to our table quickly. The wings were plump and flavorful. Finally, we found some wings that didn't skimp on the meat. The wings came with sides of ranch and carrot sticks. The burgers were awesome. The French fries were soooo tasty. I love this place and will be returning in the future.

1057774,Great experience at this UPS Store. I was visiting my folks in Vegas and had a couple of large items I needed shipped back to NC. I told them I wanted to do it as inexpensively as possible and they made it happen. Got my items today and they were beautifully packed and here on time. Thanks so much! Will recommend!,5
5511641,"I was at the club the other morning, grooming myself after my workout (you know, much like lions and monkeys...picking off the tic's and lice, smoothing my fur using saliva, etc.:-) and I thought to myself, ""I need a haircut:-)

BTW, if I can just digress for a moment...I see things at the club that no person should ever be subjected to...this particular morning was no different...an 85 year old, Grandpa Jones look alike, standing naked at one of the sinks, one leg up on the counter and shaving ""himself"" in places that I had trouble believing that anyone other him would care about...you just can't ""un-see"" that kind of thing:(

If that describes you...please, for the love of god...go into a shower stall or something...I was blinded from seeing this and I spent the next twenty minutes stumbling along, asking for someone to just put me out of my misery, before I managed to grope my way into a shower and boil myself:)

Anyway...I still needed a haircut...(or, I needed to reform my band from 1970...we played a very ragged version of ""House of the Rising Sun""...and that's about all we played:)

These days, my choice for sartorial reconstruction is V's Barber Shop...I used to go to Great Clips, but V's  has won me back and won me back for good:)

This location is everything I want in a great barber shop...a manly experience that simply cannot be duplicated at a ""salon"":)

Nowhere near enough testosterone in any salon...even the unisex Super Clips and Great Cut's:)

That's not the case at V's...it's all testosterone, all the time:)

The barbers are all barbers...they may be stylists too, but first and foremost, they are barbers...they know how to cut hair for men and they know how to chat with guys like the great barbers I used to frequent in San Francisco and Portland.

Lots of sports to talk about (and flat panel TV's with ESPN on at every station), plenty of magazines to read while I'm waiting for my call to action (and not a Cosmo or Vogue in sight:) and tons of wood paneling and manly smells (I mean witch hazel, talcum powder, etc....not ""pull my finger"" manly smells:)

And, most importantly, they cut my hair correctly...all of the barbers and any of the barbers at V's do a good job...they cut my hair right...as right as my poor misshapen head will allow:)

That's important to me, because (as I might have mentioned before), I'm not a ""classically handsome"" man...I'm a little bit ""quirky looking""...and a decent haircut helps:)

I'm pretty sure that a good haircut is the only thing that keeps the Beautiful Carin from second guessing herself and the (possibly drunken) decision making that led her to select me as her husband (no one ever believes that she proposed to me...I can't believe it myself...but that was a great haircut that I was sporting that day! :-)

So I'm back at V's and I'm happy to swing by and get my ""ears lowered"" (a colloquialism that I suppose is lost in the mists of time) and talk football and golf and chicks and other guy stuff with my buddies at V's:)

And if you need one, there are even post or pre-haircut cocktails available next door at the Arcadia Tavern...and believe me, sometimes quite a bit of alcohol is required to forget the horrors I've seen in the locker room at the Village:)

And when he finally did, the quality was horrible. Huge gaps and cracks in grout. When I told a supervisor about my complaints, they sent the SAME tech out to fix it.. and, surprise, surprise, he did a terrible job ""repairing"" his initial errors. Finally in December the company sent a new tech to fix my still-flawed floors. The new tech ended up having to retile the master bathroom from scratch because it wasn't laid and set properly.

HOWEVER, the food is utterly and absolutely disgusting! Went there with my whole family for a Saturday brunch. Ordered smoked salmon eggs benedict, waffles, veggie burger, and a bunch of other stuff. It was barely edible. Eggs served on some sickeningly off colour and mushy potato roti type thing with overaged spinach. Veggie burger burns your mouth, way over-spiced. Waffles soggy on the bottom (from sucking some kind of liquid) and dried out on top. etc. etc.

Bottom line: if you go there, stick to drinks ... although they also managed to serve lemonade without ice (so lukewarm). They just don't bother putting any kind of effort with the food, probably because they know they will get customers regardless because of the patio and location alone. It would be a perfect candidate for one of those restaurant makeover shows where the TV personality yells at the chefs and owners for being lazy or incompetent.",1
300724,"I traveled from Seattle and picked this place from Yelp. It was GREAT!!! I had pulled pork and hot links with mac cheese. They have many kind of bbq sauces you can try. Staff was friendly and helpful.

I'd recommend this place to anyone",5

The manager had on gloves because she was cutting fruit but preformed many tasks with out removing them (cash register, turned on tv poured drinks) and then returned to continue cutting. So strange to watch. We had a few appetizers and a drink. Don't even know what we ate. Sad because there is so little to offer in Southern Highlands.",2

Their words: ""My drivers work minimum wage plus tips and doesn't want to risk their safety.""This is a predominantly black area and apparently we're vicious animals that prey on pizza drivers. Seeing as the Twinsburg Sheriff's department patrols this area and practically LIVES in this area. They took the money off my card and now I have to wait 24-hours to get the money back on my card. The only money I had left to feed my family. I will never do business with this pizza place ever again. I will make it known that the owner of this establishment is racist.",1

4501882,"I'm not a huge meat-eater, so I'm going to focus on the veggies for this review....and, comparing them to Mac's down the way since that is my favorite BBQ joint.

Amazing fresh, seasoned crinkle-cut fries. I mean, they're crinkle-cut fries, but try them. Seriously. I've never had Mac's fries, but I doubt they get much better than this.

Lightly battered yet crispy and flavorful fried pickles (edged out Mac's for my number 1 fried pickle, which was not an easy decision!)

Fried corn-good, but with the French fries and fried pickles, I probably would have enjoyed this corn freshly steamed/grilled better. Add salt-it makes it yummier. 

Macaroni and cheese. Not bad, uses more of a cheese sauce than melty/crusty/baked cheese. I prefer the latter, and depending on the day (i.e. Mac's isn't skimping on the cheese), Mac's has them beat.

The collard greens were sweet and yummy, but I felt like the serving was a little small. Mac's has a little more spice and tang to the sweetness, adding depth of flavor, but I did enjoy them and would order them again.

The baked beans were just okay to me. They had a little extra BBQ or smoked flavor, but they didn't stand out to me. I happen to love Mac's baked beans so the bar was very high, but I'd probably give them a 5/10, whereas Mac's gets a 10 out of 10 for me.

My son got the beef brisket the first time we went, but it was pretty fatty and from my perspective Mac's has amazing brisket. I got turkey the last time I went and it was okay, a little dry. The BBQ sauce was good though, which made up for it, almost.

Overall Sauceman's will be added to our list of BBQ choices, but probably only when I'm craving their fries and pickles.",4

I drug my husband over excited to try it and hoping to see an improvement. No such luck. No vegetarian entree, not really kid friendsly, small portions, pricey. Not what we were looking for in an evening. Love to support new restaurants but wont be back. Hope they figure it out and make it work.",3
2744470,"The beef was overcooked, dry, and mostly tasteless. That said, it was still ""tender"" as it was cut thin/against the grain (it is possible for meat to be both tender/dry/overcooked). I used a groupon to eat there so I wasn't too disappointed, however if I had paid full price I would have been pretty pissed. For what they charge (close to 10 bucks for a sandwich/fries/drink) it needs to be a heck of a lot better than what they serve.",1
4024473,"Hubby and I love going out for breakfast and since this was new to our neighborhood we decided to give it a try. The place has nice decor and the waiter was decent. What we didn't like is where the owners cut corners.  The home fry potatoes were obviously previously frozen from a bag because they were perfectly cubed, tasted bad and had a spoon full of peppers and onions randomly placed on top. I ordered a fruit side with my meal and again, was previously frozen. I understand cost and time  savings measures but this took away the quality of the meal and sorry to say, we won't be back.",2

I personally enjoy the 1/3 rack of ribs with Brisket and 2 sides. I have never been a fan of potato salad, that being said Bryan's has the most amazing potato salad I have ever had!!  The BBQ beans are also very good and a little spicy.  The best side choice for me is the Slaw!!  Ribs are always smoked to perfection here.

Looking for a place for dinner at almost 9pm. First we thought Japanese, but I'm sorry to say that after being seated for ten minutes and not being offered a drink we got up and left, then we say Osteria Costa. Although we love Italian food, we normally don't eat it out, preferring to try food we don't cook so much at home. 
What a delight Osteria Costa is! Firstly, all the staff were extremely attentive and friendly - we didn't wait more than 30 seconds before we had water and menus. Jen, our lovely waitress brought us some delicious (although a little expensive ) wine selections & explained the menu to us.
We decided to share appetizer, salad, entree & dessert 'family style'. Everything was delicious, from the creamy burrata, the crusty bread, garlicky pesto, shaved Parmesan on the arugula salad to the perfectly prepared Branzino. And not a bone in sight on the whole fish dish. We topped it off with the 'famous' olive oil cake - which was so good, not too sweet an end to a fantastically fine meal - Italian done right (not a red sauce in sight) - I'm making that olive oil cake this weekend!!

Portions were sized just right, but I found the food to be a little bland. Nothing was wrong with it, but it wasn't remarkable. I ordered the Herb Roasted Chicken, and while it was huge, it wasn't memorable. 

Where the food was slightly bland, the service was far from it. I honestly felt like I was dining at a 5-Star, 5-Diamond restaurant. The server and waiter were both very knowledgeable about the menu, were friendly while talking to us, and catered to our every need. Our table's glasses were never empty, and whatever we asked for was given to us immediately.

It took 20 minutes (I timed it because I had to be somewhere).  The cashier counted my $5 in ones 6 times and had to use a calculator to make change.  From the looks of it the place is just horribly disorganized.  They check people out in order.  That means if you're behind a family with a complicated order you wait until that is cooked and rung up.  If you get a long line of orders.....well there's my 20 minutes.

Don't let the tiny cup and baby spoon fool you, this coffee packs a big punch.  Very strong yet smooth and not bitter.  We decided in tapas and forgive me for not remembering the names of the dishes, but my descriptions should suffice.  First was chorizo with garlic and onions coverered in melted  cheese and seven with sliced buttered bread.  Immediately I fantasized about taking down this dish after a night of binge drinking.  The bread sopped up all the grease and oily goodness.  Second we had fried plantain cups filled with shrimp and topped with more cheese.

Other than the great food, atmosphere was nice, and the small staff was friendly and personable.  Will come back again.",4

2255086,"Stopped by Egg Works before heading back to LA after reading about it in a little magazine that was in the taxi. We decided to make the trek out because of the free breakfast entree coupon. The yelp reviews looked great, so we decided to head to Egg Works instead of a typical Sunday brunch on the strip. Whenever we woke up that Sunday morning, we packed and stumbled to the car to get some breakfast. After about a 20 minute drive from the strip, we finally arrived at Egg works. 

The place is relatively big, so the wait for 3 wasn't about 15 minutes. After being seated, we were promptly served drinks and then was left to look over the extensive menu. I decided on a side order of the corned beef hash and the Green Chili omelet. The omelet was extremely large. It probably had 3 whole Ortega chilies, a ton of cheese, and another ton of cheese on top. The omelet was good, but nothing special. Along with the omelet came a side of home potatoes that seemed like it was tossed with a whole bottle of Lawry's season salt. If you like that stuff, then you'll love these potatoes. If not, I'd see if they can cut the season salt next time. The corned beef and hash was interesting. It was more like corned beef and mashed potato pancake that was crisped on the flat top. 

Overall, if you have time to venture beyond the strip, check Egg Works out. You won't be hungry after the meal.",4

I was out milling about on Mill Ave, and while we were trying to find our next stop, we walked by the open door and empty bar. The guy at the door was enticing us with $4 Long Islands and $2 shots. I can see why....no one wants to come in here. It's lame.

You see, back when it was The Library, this place had attractive bartenders dressed as....librarians (skirts and all). A magical place, where you could have a great time. Then it started getting played out, and eventually closed.

Now, it's Blondies....it's just a run of the mill (get it?) bar with average drinks, a great location, no TV's, turrible music and a pathetic crowd. There's no theme, it's disgusting, and the ghetto crowd in the back playing Beer Pong was lame.

They didn't even have red/blue party cups. They were using cheap plastic tumblers for Beer Pong. Isn't that illegal?

I've been complaining for a while, so you are probably thinking, ""Dave, why didn't you just leave?"" The night was winding down, we were kind of tired, and we just wanted to chill. Afterall, there were plenty of places to sit, since hardly anyone was in here. 

And yes, I know it's summer and school is out. That didn't stop other places from having a crowd. Just sayin. Just sayin....

5920138,"My FAVORITE frozen yogurt hub is Menchie's!!! 

Although the flavors change regularly, I can usually find at least two flavors to mix & match. I'm a choco-holic -- so, my fav combo is a chocolate/coffee/vanilla mix with spanish peanuts, coconut & topped with hot fudge!! Sounds almost like a tin roof sundae? YEP! 

However, on a couple of visits, they did not have the coffee (or cappucino) flavor yogurt. Bummed ... But, I found Cake Batter flavor or cheesecake flavor is a decent substitute if need be.  Samples are always available in little cups, which is a good way to figure out the perfect concoction. One of these visits, I'm going to have to try the fruit flavor frozen yogurts -- in particular, lemon & raspberry together. ... But, it just seems every time I go in there, I crave the chocolate & hot fudge experience!! Prices are based on the weight of yogurt & toppings in an ample cup. So, it can get expensive -- and you never know how much it will be until it's weighed at checkout.  Be sure to pick up a Menchie's Passport -- sign up online and use your passport card with every purchase to accumulate points to get a $5 credit with every 50 points. 

On my last visit to Menchie's, the store was selling ""Paws"" in support of the Cleveland APL (for which I volunteer) -- I bought a few ""paws"" that were immediately posted on their wall. The clerk was a slightly older woman (40s-50s) and she was a dynamo! She was happy, friendly, knowedgeable on flavors, specials, and the APL charity. She was a very good face for this Menchie's store in Westlake (Crocker Park).

5061937,"Whaaat?  No love for Ange Ricky?  I'll have to fix this.

My boyfriend and I were a little unsure about the goat tassot, so Ange let us try it before ordering.  It was VERY slightly spicy.  Oh, and delicious.  It sounds a little funky, but it doesn't taste too outlandish.  The chicken was good too, but I was too sold on the goat.

I also got her vanilla lemonade.  I ordered it as a slush, which was way too good.  The only problem is that it had very large chunks of ice in it, which made drinking it awkward.  I'd suggest not getting the slush; just keep it simple and get it as a liquid.

I didn't like the plantains, though I'm a hard sell on that, since I don't like bananas much.  They were too hard and dry for my tastes.

Ange was also extremely sweet and welcoming.  Her personality alone could make this an enjoyable experience.  And just the goat and the lemonade would bring me back here in a heartbeat.  That is, if I didn't live in California.",4

I sat for 45 minutes while other people, who didn't have appointments were taken in front of me with no explanation or anything of why I had to wait. When I got up and walked out the girl just looked at me and said nothing.

1032612,"I went in last year to get a tuneup and fix a flat.

afterwards my bike derailleur system was messed up, skipping and changing gears, so went back, spent some cash on replacement parts, it got worse, went back again, spent more cash, still the same, but now had spent $350+ on to fix a flat a tuneup and bike was in WORSE condition then when I started

went back again end of 2013 with third complaint, after arguing that it wasn't me or the way the bike was made (NEVER had these issues before they did the tuneup) they made some adjustments, was better but not perfect

took my bike out this spring, the bike derailleur behaves like a piece of cr@&, on downhills and up hills or whenever there is lots of torque, derailleur again constantly skips, jumps, misses gears causing horrible cycling conditions... and the light i also bought the first time broke with button just falling off, useless...

i always try to have nothing but positive reviews, but I just have to warn others about this place, i've never spent 30% of value of an asset on repairs and had it come back in worse condition.. beware",1
4240727,"Look elsewhere if craving good Indian food. My husband and I live in Rochester NY and the Indian food there is not quite what I'm used to as I grew up in Toronto. I thought for sure Montreal would live up to my expectations but I was disappointed. We didn't have data on our phones to check out the Yelp reviews beforehand so we decided to give it a try. Ambiance is nice with a good sized outdoor patio. Service was well paced. We ordered the butterfly prawn appetizer. When it came out it wasn't what I expected. It was flattened out prawn with a thick coating of breading. When I tried to bite in it was very hard and I couldn't even chew it. We sent it back. They apologized and asked if we wanted another plate of it. I said no thanks but they ended up bringing it anyway, on the house. That was considerate but I didn't want it in the first place. For dinner we got the karai ghost and a mushroom bhaji dish. We had to add salt to our dishes since it wasn't flavorful enough for our spice craving palates. Naan was good and fresh. Overall, disappointing flavorless Indian food.",3

I had a very short wait and then I was on my way into the eye exam. We went through the exam part quickly, as it always seems to be with these exams.

With all the hype, design, and work to have this place open in our neighborhood, I expected more on the menu.  You have $3.50 tacos, chips/salsa, and a couple other appetizer type foods that could rival a food truck - not a full service restaurant.

Don't even bother looking at the menu, order this gem. You won't be disappointed in the slightest. When I first arrived and had seen the reviews, I was tempted to try the tacos or burger. Uh, no. The chopped salad is where it's at and rightfully how The Gladly has its fame. Ask the wait staff to mix it for you and you'll see just how intricately the ingredients blend together. Every piece is crucial to the overall taste. I recommend ordering it with avocado as that definitely livens things up, but I'm sure it would be fine on its own too.

Oh, and they also serve a great Arnold Palmer ;)",5

Practically the first words out of the owner were, ""call 911.""  Yea....I was overcharged, asked for my money back, and have been being harassed from this company ever since!  They are claiming that I am lying about how many times I have even been there!  When in fact, their own stylists are lying about how many times they have done=screwed up my hair and are reporting it differently (OR NOT AT ALL) in their computers!  The first stylist I saw there was LENA=bad haircut!  I came in for it to be fixed by the most experienced person they had, which is what I had requested initially but they decided to give me Lena, with only 3 yrs experience.  After most experienced Sarah had fixed my haircut, I decided to let Sarah do another cut and also dye my hair.  BAD CHOICE!  I would have never had SARAH do my cut or dye again after the first screw up but instead of just giving me my money back like I requested they insisted on fixing it!  And, she did so again the 2nd time, and again the 3rd time!  She is the teacher there, so this is why I allowed it to be her to try to fix it instead of obviously going with a different stylist but since Sarah is the teacher there I figured I was getting the best they had to offer...YIKES!!!  I am obviously the idiot for assuming they actually knew how to do hair in any way at this salon...I take responsibility for being the idiot (I'M TOO NICE!) for allowing them to push me around instead of just refunding my money like I requested the first, second, and third times.  BUT NOW, THEY TOOK IT TOO FAR!  THEY ARE STEALING MY $210, NEVER PROVIDED THE SERVICE THEY HAVE NOW CHARGED ME TWICE FOR AND ON TOP OF THAT THEY ARE THREATENING ME WITH LAWSUITS AND WASTING TAXPAYERS' MONEY CALLING 911 FOR NO REASON OTHER THAN TO COVER UP THEIR OWN UGLY BUSINESS PRACTICES!  SECRETS HAIR SALON IS HORRIBLLE!!!!!!  I actually have it all written down in my calendar (& on my head:() (however, not one of these ""women"" will even listen to or try to help me-instead they just called 911!  The manager, Luann, (with the full support of her owner=evil!) threatened me on a voicemail that they would attempt to get their lawyers involved because I left a comment on Facebook so others will know that these ""women"" will NOT only screw up your hair and steal your money afterward, they are threatening your civil rights!!!!!  Freedom of speech, honesty, & integrity do not even exist in this salon!  And, they actually did call the cops on me and I had to talk to 2 cops when I showed up just for proof of where in their computers it says I have only seen Sarah 2 times!  When I have in reality seen her 4 times!!!!!!!!!!! 1 fix haircut after LENA originally screwed it up + 3 bad haircuts/dye jobs!  HERE R THE DATES: 2/12: bad haircut and dye job (from SARAH), 2/19 SARAH was supposed to fix instead yet another bad haircut and dye job from SARAH, 4/12 SARAH was supposed to fix but received yet another bad haircut & dye job from SARAH!  Of course I was charged the $100 ($65 dye + $35 cut) the first time Sarah did cut and dye (2/12), BUT for some reason she charged me another $110 (dye + cut + $10 gloss) on 4/12, but that was supposed to FIX the crap cut and color she had given me the first and second times!  NOW, THE TOP HALF OF MY HEAD IS BRASSY ORANGE WITH BRIGHT NEON YELLOW PATCHES/HIGHLIGHTS :( & THE REST OF MY HAIR IS AN UGLY ORANGE BROWN :(:(:(  I USED TO RECEIVE COMPLIMENTS ON MY HAIR EVERYWHERE I WENT UNTIL I STARTED COMING TO THIS SALON, NOW EVERYONE I SEE SAYS ""IT'S NOT TOOOO BAD:(""  I have seriously gotten the exact same haircut at Great Clips & Wal-Mart!!!!  Save your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  And your sanity!  They leave voicemails on my phone 10 times in a row after 7 pm, harass me, threaten me, call the cops on me, try to have me arrested for trespassing when I show up to their business both to explain how they are mistaken and for proof of the fallacies they are spuing, but they all just want to be THIEVING LIARS and not help anyone but themselves :(  Secrets Hair Salon is BOTCHED!!!!!!!!!!!",1

3538427,"Astonishingly Mediocre 

Alas, this experience was everything I dislike about corporate restaurants--unenthusiastic employees following a script, slow and incompetent service, uninspiring food.

While I understand that a party of 9 is a large group, the restaurant wasn't busy during our time there at lunch, and there seemed to be no cross service to help out our waitperson.  Despite being perhaps 30% full, our lunches took about 25 minutes to deliver.  And the order was incomplete, one entree was incorrect, one not delivered at all.  Too bad it was wings, as it took another 20 minutes for them to arrive--and these too were incorrect.  I guess other than being part of the name, wings are a difficult entree to prepare.

The waitperson apologized, then started complaining about the kitchen staff--true professionalism.  The head host (who introduced herself as we sat and left a flyer with us) never came by to apologize.

Despite us being obviously ready to go after over an hour there, the waitperson had to go back and finalize the bill, which was incorrect.  We were charged for the delayed (and incorrect wings), but were not charged for the incorrect salad entree.  That would somewhat make sense, but it was not mentioned by the waitperson, so I don't know if it was a mistake or intentionally complimentary.

My entree was entirely forgettable (indeed, a few days later I have no recollection of what it was).  I do recall that the onion rings were soggy and greasy.

I have two issues with TJ's:  
1)  You can't go there looking for something specific, because they may not have it
2)  Their produce is very often wack!  I went looking to buy a zucchini once, and I had the option of buying 7 zucchini that were pre-wrapped, or a bag of baby zucchini.  ???

That said, they have great (cheap!) wine selection, lots of fun prepacked meals to try, interesting vegetarian products (Trader Joe's chickenless chicken nuggets, anyone?), and lots of cheese.

Presentation 5/5
Taste 3/5

ICE CREAM: it was very blan and didn't taste any different than regular soft serve. Which is disappointing. They give you a lot of ice cream though. I would say the portions are great for sharing. 

Waffle: it was very fluffy and sweet. I really liked the waffle and how you have many flavours of waffle to choose from. However, your waffle will get wet and soggy by the time you're half way done your soft serve. Half of the waffle will be perfect, the other half is wet and tastes like your melted ice cream.

I would probably not come back again since there are so many other Asian ice cream shops in the GTA that has way better ice cream minus the soggy waffles.",4
5818170,"I came to Las Vegas in March looking for a place for my husband and I to live. 
Debbie Bird {Real Estate agent} showed me the property at Bella Vista. When I first saw it I really liked it because the appliance matched. It was enough room for My husband and I and our 2 pets. 
I immediately got everything in motion so I could go back east and pack. I gave myself 3 days to find a place. I went into Remax Central on Sahara
and met Tobie. Tobie went over the lease. I told her my husband and cat will come later has he was finishing up things back east. The rent was 
$699. I paid a pet deposit of $300 for my Pom among other fees. I told Tobie  my husband and cat will be here later on in the year. She said as soon as they get here we will have to pay another pet deposit for the cat. No problem. Tobie and I agreed on that. I left Las Vegas with the lease stating $699 a month. I signed a year lease. Gave money for a year lease. 
I signed the lease in March. I did not move in until May18.  
In the middle of April I get an email from someone name Laurine Huynh from Remax Central stating that I will have to pay for my cat before I get there. I wrote back and told her Tobie and I agreed that when my husband and cat get to Las Vegas just come into Remax and pay another pet deposit.
Laurine Huynh Very Nasty person said Tobie is not a leasing agent she filled in for her because she was on pregnancy leave. I said well how was I suppose to know what position Tobie is and did not know who  Laurine is. I have never heard of you.
First I thought it was a scam. So I wrote Tobie she said Laurine is the leasing manager. I talked to Laurine and told her Tobie and I had an agreement I signed a lease with Tobie not with you. I also stated to her so everything Tobie said was a lie? Her words were that's not what I am saying. I said yes it is because if it was not then why are you telling me something totally different from what tobie and i discussed in March and a lease i already signed.
I left Las Vegas thinking the rent was $699.
It changed to I had to pay for my cat deposit right at that moment even though I did not know when my husband and cat would be here.  Another fee came up $50 extra a month for my husband and cat. I said for my husband and cat are you kidding me. She wrote back and said: 
Because you are adding extra people. What?? extra people? How is my husband an extra person. This is a 2 bedroom 1 bath condo.On the application said will except pets 2 maximum. I had already agreed to pay a security deposit for my cat even though I did not know when they would be there. Then another total came up. She said I would have to pay extra $75 for an extra inspection. WHAT!!!??? The lease I signed with Tobie already said it was going to be inspection every 3 months. Which was no extra money to me. So I have to pay for extra inspection for what month? They were already going to inspect it every 3 months so basically she was trying to make me pay for inspection that was already in the lease.
JOHN and RUTH AHLBRAND is the owner of that Remax on 8400 W Sahara so i received in my email something that wanted me to give them my automatic signature
I never signed that. But i did sign for extra fee for $50 more a month for rent for as they sated: EXTRA PEOPLE. I could have said NO but that would have meant i would have to come back to Las Vegas and start over. Laurine even said i could pay the extra $50 for the whole year if i wanted to. I said NO. I will pay it monthly.
They already had a year worth of rent from me and now they were going to have $50 more a month for my husband and cat. They thought they was going to get that $75 for an extra inspection which i fought NOT to give. 
When i got here in May2014 the air condition was broke. I spent 3 hot days in that apartment. I have high blood pressure, heart failure and i am disabled. The microwave was filthy underneath. The refrigerator was not cold. They had to replace all of that. She talked about me paying for that old nasty microwave. But they realized it was old and nasty underneath the vent. I guess i was so relieved to get a place {I was only in town for 3 days} i really did not look underneath the microwave.
Derek the repair man {extremely nice} had to replace the bulb in the stove. When he pulled the stove out OMG there was dog food, dirt, a dog toyand a lot of food crumbs. 
Everything was wrong got fixed or replaced but not without the attitude of Re/max.
I never hung anything on the walls while we lived there. I did not want them try and nickle and dime us when we moved which was this year. Long year in that apartment. We hired Maria House Cleaning service to clean and that place looked cleaner after we left than before. The stove had so many marks on it i thought it was part of the stove being everything was old except of the cabinets. The cabinets were changed over in all the apartments when they changed to condos.

Flash back to the valet, the parking entrance is confusing and I took an unintentional detour and then had to flag someone down after 10 minutes because they were completely ignoring me. They said they had to help the people in line, but I had been there before any of the cars arrived.

Next, the waitress disappeared for twenty minutes after taking most of the drinks sans three people. So three people were drinkless for half an hour while everyone else had their 'adult beverages'. The woman who ordered wine, (me of course), had to wait an additional 15 minutes because they were 'checking to see if they had it'.

My burger ordered medium rare was charred to a crisp that couldn't even be drowned out by the Secret Sauce. Saving grace -- the fries were good, yay.

There's a few kind of seating arrangements, whether you're looking for a quick bite or looking to get social with some friends, a date, and interview, or cozy up and get social online with your email in a corner somewhere. It's a good space if you need some focus time because it's somewhat quiet right now, but it's really quite great so if this review has anything to do with it, I hope to see a little more bustle in the near future. :)

If you're looking at staying even a little longer there's a detached back room complete with TV if you wanted to host a large meeting, or some boardgames if you feel like hanging out next to the sunny windows.

We came here really late after watching ""O"" at the Bellagio and waited at the bar for a while before we got a table. Cheap drinks! 

Tip: If you need a cab to get back to your hotel after eating here late night, make sure you ask have the hostess call while you are dining. We had to wait nearly an hour for a taxi to make its way out here to get us. That was ridiculous.",2
1588316,"Tea Space has the best boba in the area but the sweetest teas- but at least they're consistent with both. Cope by specifying less sweetness for your order and you should be good to go. Service is great, which is an anomaly for places that are adjacent to Spring Mountain Road.

Decor is cute with a cat theme, menu is pretty large, and the sizes are good for the price. For first time visitors, staff tend to recommend the house teas, which seem to be extra-sweet due to being made with half and half or cream? Unclear, but too sweet for me. They're great about adjusting or remaking drinks to fit your preference- the wintermelon beverages are refreshing in this ungodly summer heat.

Note that their signage is a bit faded and the storefront looks like it might be closed from the outside- it's in the same little building as the diabetic sweets bakery, and seems to have popped up overnight.

EDIT: Dropping a star. Service has been lacking the past couple of times I've been here. They're open late but manage to make me feel like I'm inconveniencing them if I pop in and interrupt their chat time as the only customer after 10PM.",3

Now it was time to paint the exterior of my house so it was an easy decision to call back George and his family. They did not disappoint. Their price was very fair. More importantly, the quality of the work they all did was outstanding. They are ""artists"". We now have the best looking house in the neighborhood. Many thanks to George and the gang!",5
4112320,"This place has great food (especially the shrimp, scallops, and salmon at one of the stations). It was a little pricey for not being served since it is a self-serve buffet (two of us ended up paying a total of a little over $100) but overall, great choices.",3
4807819,"This is a nice casual place to eat where you can feel situated in the heart of Venice/Vegas. It's a nice place to order shareable plates as well as entrees. My wife and I ordered a meatball appetizer, carpaccio, and the pizza Cristina, which was our favorite. The meatballs and polenta were a great combo. It was our first time trying carpaccio and we certainly would order it again. The pizza Cristina features prosciutto and arugula, which are two foods we love. Good service and pleasant lively environment. We were able to listen to the live music playing at the Venetian every 15 minutes or so.",4

OMG! the food here was to die for. I have never had brisket like this! I mean really NEVER! I did not expect much and when I got my sandwich I was in SHOCK! I mean really it was like I was in HEAVEN! Service was nice and friendly and the food was just hot and fresh!!

The brisket was way way cool. I want to give this place a 10. This place made the visit all worth it. Thank god I found this place. I will come here every time! BEST FOOD BBQ FOOD EVER!!!!


COME HERE NOW Its that good!

GREAT JOB GUYS AND GALS!",5
5501372,This was my first visit at this location and I had a great experience. It was recommended to me by my hair salon since I was looking for a new hair dryer. I was greeted right as I walked in and as I stood staring at the large selection someone quickly came to see if I needed any help. They were very knowledgeable and I have been very happy with the one they helped me select! Great products and great service. Thanks!,5
212765,"Ok, we came back for a second time. The food is acceptable. The first time we dined during the week. There were 8 tables and 2 servers and 2 tables occupied. Service was annoyingly slow. The second time we dined on the weekend. This time there were 3 servers. We ordered drinks and our meal. Our meal came quickly but our drinks???? After my husband got up several times to alert the waitress that we still did not have our beverages, our food got cold, our tortillas dried out and finally our drinks came. Really? The table next to us waited 15+ minutes before someone took their order? I don't know how others feel but when we go out we like a relaxing environment and we want to be served. We don't want to fight for our food or bev. Even though I like the food we will not be going back. Who needs the aggravation. That is not what dining out is about!  Educate your staff to run your establishment correctly. Thumbs down on our overall experience. And in my last review I mentioned that this is not authentic Mexican food. The website should take the word AUTHENTIC out of its description. If you want acceptable food and an aggravating experience GO. The food is not disappointing but make sure you beg for additional sauce... They are not offered.",2
4773165,"One of my favorite korean eatery. Have tried a variety of their tofu soup and love them all, the broth is very flavorful. Also tried several other dishes here (seafood noodle soup, japchae, bulgogi, bibimbap, seafood pancake, etc) and have always been satisfied with their flavor and portion size. 

However, their side dishes are not as good as Gogi's. I also like the taste of Gogi's kimchi  better than Chodang's. Prices are a little higher than other korean restaurants in town. 

Would be nice if they offer lunch special like Gogi.",4
3658640,"We went to Morton's for a regular weekly dinner night, heading in they offer valet but we had to wait a bit for them to open. Talking with no smartphones.. it was horrible. The interior is dark, cool, polished and has a sleek modern appearance. I prefer this kind of environment that's very dark, so if this isn't your thing you may not enjoy the atmosphere. Perfect for a romantic date night. I ordered a mojito and it tasted like a very watery mojito with barely there liquor and a few mint leaves floating around in the glass. Sent it back and ordered a sangria instead which was much better. I am fortunate enough to have access to some of the best wines, so I never really order their wines here. They offer cabinets to store your own wine. The jumbo shrimp cocktail sauce was bland to my shrimp cocktail. Lucky Wishbone where are you?!?! I longed for just a bit of horseradish..
The BLT crab cakes were fried crisply but lacked color, and appeared a little unappetizing but tasted like meaty crab. The filet mignon sandwiches and prime cheeseburgers arrived hot but the filet mignon was a little overcooked and on the tougher side than normal. I think they were having an off night I guess because the restaurant was absolutely dead inside until it started to pick up at the end. The service was very nice and was at least redeeming in that quality. The sangria surprisingly was boozy enough to make me forget all my cares temporarily and scarf down truffle fries.",3
202706,I was in town for business and needed to find a local restaurant. My coworkers and I choose Little Italy on Mayfield.

44608,"My first trip to the Mirage was a great one! The hotel and casino are beautiful and fairly easy to navigate (which is saying something for Vegas which has famously confusing casino floors). We had an excellent experience with the front desk staff - Luis was extremely professional and helpful for us in securing our room upgrade. Our room was amazing and the housekeeping staff did a great job. 

There is a lot to do on site at the Mirage. The Mirage volcano (which underwent a $25 million upgrade I believe) was brand new to us on this trip - the past times we had been it was under construction. Definitely do not miss this! The pool at the Mirage was awesome although nothing too different from most resort pools I have been to. The Paradise Cafe (located by the pool) had great service and food. 

It's not advertised but the Sigfried and Roy Tiger Habitat offers a $3 per ticket discount to Mirage hotel guests if you show your room key. We gladly took advantage of this and enjoyed seeing all the animals. 

The Beatles Revolution lounge (located just off the casino) has a really cool ambiance and atmosphere, but $9 for a Heineken bottle is a bit excessive. We loved the Beatles Love Cirque du Soleil gift shop - sadly we could not get tickets for the show, so we spent a good amount of money in the gift shop buying souvenirs instead.

One downside to staying at the Mirage is the $20/day resort fee and additional tax that is charged not only on the room but the resort fee as well. To their credit, they are up front about the resort fee - it was NOT hidden, we were well aware of its existence before we booked our room.",5
2637839,"Good food. However they need to get rid of the tablets they use to take orders. This isn't a large restaurant with 100 tables. I ordered the chili with cheese and onions and a Cobb salad.

Got medium lemon pepper shrimp, corn, potato & sausage and was totally an amazing choice!! It was soooo good!! Had jessica & Rick as servers and they made the experience fun, energetic & making us wanna come back tomorrow!! What topped it off compared to the other places was that they give you gloves to use (I have a cut on my finger so didn't want to get the sauce on it) and they have sinks outside the bathroom to wash your hands! Oh AND the whole ambiance and feel of this location I LOVEEE!! It's interior design was so nice and clean and the fact that it wasn't busy made the experience so relaxing while we ate!! Thanks for coming to this side!! See you tomorrow :)",5
4951241,This is the worst Taco Bell I have ever been to. I asked for sauce at the drive thru and she threw one sauce in my bag. Which was super rude. Then I got home and we were missing one of the burritos which we paid for. We called and the same girl who was working the drive thru answered. Her name is Dori and she claimed to be the manager and refused to tell us who is above her and was incredibly unprofessional and rude over the phone. She in no way compensated for our troubles. To top it all of I found a piece of plastic in my burrito. Never going here again. Worst experience ever.,1
3407201,"Rating 4.5 stars
I am digging this place. The night we went it was a Sunday night and the place was full but not overly so that you can't walk around the place. Lots of comfy leather chairs to lounge on, good music and a full bar that won't keep you waiting. The inside has dark and rich tones, lots of framed art- from the odd to the strange, decorated ceilings and lots of things that catch your attention. I like that they have some private rooms that is ornately decorated- seems to be a harem styled room-swags of cloth, rich decoration and lots of gold and reds. That night they had a burlesque performer...very fitting for this place. 

The main attraction here is the view and the lights of Sin City. The view is spectacular...amazing. I heard the Foundation Room seems to be members only but once in a while, they do open this place to the public. If you can, go...it is nice change from the big clubs on the strip and the views will have you appreciating vegas a lil bit more.",4
316914,"If -5 Stars was possible, I would do so. What a Terrible experience with this dealership in particular we had. After several broken promises/lies it's come down to  There general fiance manager (JT) disregarding us. What a shame, I would look elsewhere for a different dealership.",1
4145338,"The hotel rooms are a bit cheaper than its competitors considering the quality of room that you get.

I've stayed in the Deluxe Suite, corner Business Suite (Rm 6002) and Vdara Suite (Rm 43010).

The Business Suite and Vdara Suite are basically the same except that the view from the business suite that we were in was the Aria Shuttle (looks like the Disneyland monorail). The view at our Vdara Suite was pretty nice, we could see the strip, including the bellagio water show.

List of things that impressed me:
- kitchen sink/stove/cabinetry
- separate door for the bedroom
- pull out sofa, dining table
- full sized stainless steel refrigerator
- electronic blackout curtains/shades
- washer/dryer set
- bathtub
- 2 free water bottles per night

List of things we needed to call for:
- extra towels
- setting up the pullout sofa
- detergent
- pots/pans/cookware
- extra soap

Convenience Store
The walk to the nearest convenience store is a few minutes away. Around the roundabout to Aria and through Aria's entrance, you'll immediate see ""Elements"" which is Aria's 24/hr convenience store.

Cosmopolitan
We found that walking outside alongside cosmopolitan was the quickest way to get there. It beats walking through Aria, then the mall, then over the bridge.

Earl of Sandwiches
Again, walking right alongside the Cosmopolitan hotel was the quickest way to get to Earl of Sandwiches.

Planet Hollywood vs Vdara - Go Vdara
If your decision is to either stay at Planet Hollywood or Vdara, I would probably stay at Vdara based on the quality of the room that you get for the price. No, it doesnt have a casino, but think of that as a good thing, for most.

Customer Service
The front desk was extremely attentive to our needs. Housekeeping was fairly quick, with the exception of check-in times. Make sure to request that your sofa bed get done when the sun is down, you'll get a lot quicker service this way. Be nice to your housekeeping lady that fixes up your room because most likely, she'll be the one fixing up your room the next day as well, tip her the first day at minimum.

Late Night Munchies
Sorry, no late night munchies at Vdara except for room service, you'll have to walk to Aria for that.

Cafe Downstairs
The food takes about 20 minutes to get, so you'll have to be patient. Luckily, I was working on my laptop using my tethered internet, so it was a pleasant time while I was there.

Free Wifi (512kbps included)
Don't expect fast internet, it's slow, for free. Fast if you pay? I'm not sure, I didn't rely on their internet, I just tethered.

AT&T iPhone 5 Reception
The reception is good when you're on the lower floors. I had LTE on the lower floors. However, up on the 43rd floor, it took forever for pages to load while browsing. Reception was also a bit choppy for the people I was talking to on the phone. It's not the hotel's fault, it's just that I was too high up.

Pool
Don't expect much, it's a little pool with a bunch of seats to lay down on. They provide towels. They check your room key before letting you enter. There's a large rectangular spa as well. The music is ok, could be louder and more modern selection.

In short, my stay was great.",5

1636190,"Do everything online now as I can't stand to go in this store and deal with the wait. Have had to wait over an hour on numerous occasions.

The last time I called Verizon and they told me I needed to take my phone to the store to have them look at it. I said ""I don't want to go to that store because the wait is so long"" and he offered to call and see how long the wait was. He told me he called the store and was told there was no wait and to head right over there. I was standing in the store in less than 10 minutes and found that there was a 50 minute wait. Once I got called she told me ""we don't have a replacement phone and will have to order one for you"". There was no reason I had to go to the store to begin with.

5503529,"Hadn't had Domino's in years (maybe?) and wanted to try them out to see if they were any better than I had remembered.  They had a killer deal of a 2 topping large pizza for $5.99.  With a deal like that, how could I pass that up? 

I placed my order online for a large steak and onion pizza with their garlic white sauce.  Paid with my card online, drove down at my specified time, and they were just getting it out of the oven.  The lady at the shop was welcoming, smiling, and friendly.

The pizza?  Not too shabby!  The toppings were pretty skimp, but overall, the crust was good, the cheese was just enough, and the sauce was tasty.  A tad salty, but not horribly bad where you need to grab a glass of water right away.  Me and my buddy split the pizza and he thought it was pretty tasty.  

A $3.00 lunch, per person?  Shit, you really can't eat anywhere for that cheap. It's no Grimaldis, but for the extremely low cost, it is more than serviceable and was a good ""chain"" pizza.  I would not hesitate to order from this Domino's again.",3

Anyway, it changed hands and even changed locations [across the walkway] a few months ago.  The coffee, while no longer the best this side of Flagstaff is still really good and the home made whipped cream is always delicious.

A prior reviewer lamented that it turned its back to the street and is now open only to the rear parking lot.  In Phoenix-speak that is a betrayal of right-thinking anti-sprawlism. I agree.  Maybe a small point, maybe not.

It has a menu now!  The food keeps to the same standards as the pastries and beverages, which probably explains why there's almost always a line at the counter and rarely a 4-top available.

One thing this place has always had is a distinct personality, which changes in a big way with new ownership and many little ways with staff.  I've always loved that about it.",4
4977509,"This place was very difficult to find and the store fronts in the Grand Canal Shoppe were not helpful in finding this place. And surprisingly, neither was the security guard! 
After paying at the front desk by the Canyon Cafe and the rock climbing wall, the Women's locker room was so far away. You walk down an endless hallway with lots of different painted colored walls and turns. You literally feel lost!

The spa itself was ok. I went room by room to scope out the scene for the 3 hours I was there. Gave each room a good 30 min to chill out and try to take it all in... I excepted much more. 
- The showers had (note ""had"") a eucalyptus spray that infused the shower but now it's just a dangly wire with 2 green beads? Weird that the product was discontinued but that thing just hangs there with a large sign to ""Try it out.""
- The Aquavanna room is a small spa for 6 people, 2 of those seats were tiled lounge seats. It was a tight fit to get 6 people in there.
- The Aroma room is a semi-sauna with indian chanting and good smelly stuff steaming ""herb scented air."" 
- Was definitely not impressed with the Igloo - a small room (not sure if its meant for a few people or a private experience) but a cold mist/stream of water shoots down over you... and it smells pretty...?
- The Experiential showers (i think that's what it was called?) was like the Igloo - smaller shower with Carribean storm, Tropical thunder, and some other ""experience."" It was cold, weird and couldn't get into it. It was like sitting under a sprinkler with club lighting and white noise.
- Long... I mean LONG.... hallways. What, again?!?!?! It took a long while to get to the co-ed areas like the Conservancy, Wave room, and the Salt room. 

I'd give this place a whirl again, IF and only IF I had a treatment scheduled. Would not recommend for the facility day use. Sorry!",3

5262338,WOW!  This is a beautiful Spring Training stadium!  I was able to attend the Season Opener of the D-backs and Rockies and loved this place. It did take what seemed forever to get a parking and I am sure that they have worked out the kinks.  The lawn seating covers the entire outfield and is the best place to watch a game.  The food was fantastic!  There were so many choices.  I decided to go with some fry bread and I was not disappointed.  My next visit I will have to try out Salty's or Native New Yorker.  I did get to spy on a celebrity...Gonzo was signing some autographs for some lucky fans!  I loved the selections of micro brews that are available at the stadium.  I like that this stadium has sunblock stands available courtesy of CHC.   I can't wait to watch several more games at this stadium during spring training!,4

However, if you're looking for a nicer dinner with a great atmosphere Taza's is your place. They make their own fresh pita, playfully names ""puffy pita"" by some, served with olive oil and zataar. I'd highly recommend ordering any of the meat products as they are each grilled to perfection on what must be a wood fire grill. 

My favorite plate is the Lamb Plate that can be ordered in two sizes, depending how much meat you want (I recommend eating it with the garlic sauce). The perfect wine pairing is the red Adyar wine. This wine is made in Lebanon and can only be found at Taza's or Aladdin's",5

There's a trio of flavors for the pierogi, and they're all good but the cabbage and mushroom is my favorite. Whichever you decide on, they're served in the traditional style topped with sour cream and fried onions, and they are comfort food to the max! The bratwurst sausage, dressed with cabbage and mustard, is the perfect compliment to a pint inside at Banger Brewing. Quality is solid, prices are a bit inflated due to the location (5 pierogi for $8!) but not outrageously so- the sausages and sandwiches are generous portions. I'll be back to try the meatloaf!",4

Atmosphere 
- Nicely themed restaurant, especially for the area. Good decor and vibe, place is clean and nice ambient lighting. Good for casual, family, dates.  Had to wait longer then expected for the food and bill, make sure you go with someone you can talk to cause time goes by slow. 

Menu
Your general bistro items, sandwiches, starters ( shrimp, fries, poutine, pasta, steak.... ) The mains are similar to any steak house. When it comes to pricing its a tad high then similar places, but $20 average for a main is nothing major. 

Food 
Its okay. Unfortunately the stuffed chicken which was on the menu, is no longer offered. Got substituted with an 8oz chicken breast, some veggies, and mash potatoes, doesn't come with any sides. Chicken was good, but a bit small in my opinion. Sauce was amazing, thick and creamy with good flavor. Mash potatoes was gritty, felt like it came out of a box. Not sure if its normal or if its a bad batch but would not recommend the mash potatoes. Steak was good, they know their cooking temperatures, good steak sauce. Similar complaints, small portion and mash potatoes. 

Overall
Its okay, but not sure if I will come back again for dinner, or for any of the mains. The wait time for the food and bill was a bit annoying, and food was nothing major. Maybe I'll try their sandwiches, some of them look interesting. The location and convenience is whats going for the place, and with it being halal attracts wider crowd. Its Meh...",2

1.  The soup - I really love the light flavor of the soup. I can tell that it is just like homemade, boiled for a long time with all the bones and pork and etc. Light, subtle and very tasty.

2  The Ramen - Just right Al Dente

3.  The choices -  All sorts of choices, additional toppings, larger size with more noodles and etc.

4.  The key points - I like the pork tenderloin in any ramen. I also like the flavor of green onion sliced and cooked to perfection. 

5.  Parking - Has parking, in it's own lot, however, the traffic direction seems to be a bit odd, seems that the entrance is two way, yet large enough for only one car.

6.  Service and Seating - Small, be prepared to wait, nice service, and very busy.

1305424,"My friend and I were visiting Toronto this past weekend, and after a long day of walking around the city we decided to grab some sushi to snack on before heading back to the hotel to rest and get ready for proper dinner.

We settled on Kokyo after passing by a couple other restaurants. A very nice waitress greeted us at the front door and we were seated in the outdoor patio area. The plastic lawn chairs were scuffed and old looking. There was duct tape around the outer edge of all the tables. To hide chips and cracks? Who knows. 

We ordered 4 rolls: Spicy Tuna with tempura flakes; Cucumber; Salmon; and Honolulu. The prices were pretty cheap compared to the sushi place we frequent in our hometown, so we thought we were getting a deal. 

When the rolls came out my first thought was: Holy sh*t I hope we don't get food poisoning from this. I don't know if it was the chef's first day out of school or what, but they were the sloppiest looking rolls we've ever seen. They looked like they were falling apart. And the pieces were sliced so huge, it was almost impossible to eat them in one bite. You could either try to shove the whole thing in your mouth and hope you could chew it enough to swallow, or try to take two bites, which effectively destroyed the piece and made a mess. I settled on taking two bites each, dealing with the mess to avoid choking.

As for the taste, it was MEH. We are really spoiled when it comes to sushi, our local sushi place consistently puts out exceptional food. The cucumber roll was just a (huge) chunk of cuke surrounded by rice, so it's hard to go wrong there. The Honolulu roll was good, but the avocado had some brown spots on it. The Spicy Tuna roll tasted just the slightest bit off. It looked fairly unappetizing, which probably colored our opinion. I liked the texture of the tempura flakes though. The Salmon roll was also ok. We left several pieces on the plate. We just didn't want to finish them.

Thoughout dinner there was one particularly agressive fly that would not leave me alone, and little birds hopping around the patio. Not very relaxing when you're trying to eat. Overall, I would say skip this place. I'm sure you can do better.",1

After telling them our background and situation they said we were ""solid renters"" and wouldn't have any trouble finding us a place.  
The employee seemed very disorganized and showed us one place after being there for almost half a day. He said he would call the next day with other places to show us.  I never received a call back so I called the manager explaining to her our time constraint and asked for a more aggressive person.  She had nothing but excuses and sounded like she just wanted to get me off the phone before stating that she would check my file and call back.  I have yet to receive that call.

Since the coupon was set to expire in 3 days, Linda was unwilling to honor the coupon value because the actual service was set to take place after the expiration date. I have had all other companies honor the promotional value if the service was scheduled prior to the expiration date, however Linda was completely unwilling to show any flexibility on this, and only agreed to provide 1 hr of service, as required for the $49 I paid for the coupon. Her reasoning was ""policy,"" however as the owner of her own company, that excuse does not carry much weight, as she has the authority to do as she pleases and she obviously chose not to be flexible here. She maintained a pleasant tone throughout our conversation, however the entire interaction left me feeling very frustrated.

We had Lasagna, poor or lack of flavor and Chicken Alfredo almost tasteless and the chicken was grisly. I did well to have eaten a third of it because I was extremely hungry!

I love the decorations. But having nice decorations does not mean the food will be good . What's the point of a nice place when the food taste awful . My mom ordered the chicken mole plate , mole was not from scratch it tasted more like it was from the Do√±a Maria , The chicken was not fully cooked . Which thankfully she didn't get sense she ate most of it . My Husband ordered the wet burrito he said it was okay nothing extremely bad about it . My soon ordered some nachos witch had more beans then carne asada on them . Also what makes nachos ""NACHOS"" is cheese don't be greedy with the cheese . 
My 18 month old had a sopa de fideo with no fideo in it only the broth , I did ask the server for a new one and showed him the soup . I ordered my self a disgusting Pollo A La Crema . Do Not Order this ! The chicken was not fully cooked it was still raw . The cream was not even seasoned at all it was just the cream no taste what so ever . I can say the only good thing was the rice and drinks that's it . I did tell the server and showed him the chicken he took it back offered for a new . I did not get a new one due to I was grossed out and couldn't eat any more . I do want to say that the server was very nice and he did attend to us . Sadly I will never return to this restaurant.",2

The couple that was with us didn't really have special meals either I don't think there's a reason to go back specially since it was like we're an afterthought for being there once again employees all crowded around the bar chatting and you have to flag them down to get drunk refills.

I'm writing this as I sit, extremely grossed out in my hotel room here at the travelodge. 

We checked in on Monday evening where our room seemed fine enough for what we paid. Sure it isn't the cleanest but for $30 something dollars a night you can't be too picky. We unpacked everything that we had for our seven night stay, when we realized there was no key to our in room safe. We called the front desk and they offered to move us right then. We moved to a room two doors down and packed and unpacked all of our things yet again. The next day, we found a small cockroach in the bathroom and a few moments later, a very large cockroach climbing up the wall above our bed. We went down to the front desk to show them what we just came across and they didn't even bat an eye.... That was extremely disturbing to me, that both women working did not seem the least bit alarmed at the sight of two cockroaches found in their hotel!!! They offered us yet another room but we were on our way out to a pool party and we're already running late. So we moved to our third room later that evening. Packed up all of our things again and moved them all upstairs.. We got through the next day without a cockroach sighting in our new room, up until just now! I went into the bathroom and there was a giant one sitting on my tooth brush!!!!!! I would be leaving but it's an extremely busy weekend here in vegas and everything is either booked or too pricey! Each time I try to contact a manager about our ongoing issue, she 'isn't in'. Very disappointed in spending my vacation here, it has been a headache and a disaster.

Outside of Yelp I have heard from friend's ( I don't really like them) complaining; muttering something to the effect of ""it's not that impressive"". Are you f$&king serious?!

They have always had every brand I have gone there in search of(even the elusive Christiana Vodka which I have never seen ANYWHERE else for purchase)! 

Ok,enough with the questions marks and exclamation points, the facts are they have the biggest selection and the best prices. They blow Bev Mo and Costco out of the water. People always ask me if it's REALLY cheaper then Costco, well it is....... consistently(plus you have to drop $50 just to shop at Costco). 

We usually hit the Desert Ridge location(that was my first intro), but have been hitting this new Camelback location in CenPho and we like it. It's a good spot and it's probably the only store that sells alcohol that you could spend over an hour in giggling like a child.

There are only two things I will say though - I wish there was a more convenient location that wasn't stuck in a bad intersection (McCowan & Sheppard) always seems to be so congested there I presume it's cause the Highway is a couple blocks south going towards Scarborough Town Center - like if Francesca relocated to the McCowan and Milner intersection where Cora's was that would be the perfect spot considering there's so much parking!

4342405,"3.5/5, +.5 for service

Okay I'm a sucker for these places. You pay for the atmosphere and ambience, not so much the food, although the food/drinks were also not bad.

This place opened up sometime last month, and it's a popular hangout spot for students and young professionals who want to...I won't go there. You get what I mean. The waitresses in the restaurant are called ""maids"", which is consistent of what many female servers in Japan are regarded to as. Note that on weekends there's a $10 minimum charge each person.

I've been here twice now, both times ordering a chocolate lunar cheesecake. The first time I tried the matcha latte, while the second time I tried the matcha green tea. I also ordered an angel plate the second time around, where the maid gets to draw (or write) a custom message on the omelette using ketchup.

The chocolate lunar cheesecake was surprisingly very good both times, and was definitely worth the ~$6 charge. As for the matcha drinks, I preferred the latte over the tea, as the tea was way too bitter for my liking. The omelette in my angel plate was surprisingly fluffy, similar to their original cheesecakes. Everything else in the plate was nothing special, but hey it was something neat to try.

If you're lining up in the original Uncle Tetsu store and are wanting to buy an angel hat cake, come here instead. They have a wide selection of angel hat cakes for takeout and you don't have to wait an hour in the old lineup.

Service was very good, and you can tell the maids love what they're doing. Their accents can be a bit rough at times, so do be patient in communicating. Either way I'd definitely return here, maybe to catch a show in the future (both times I went during the day).",4

To be honest, other than lamp skewers and beer, other stuff are pretty under average... 

The 3.5 star rating goes to the lamp skewers and beer only ..

P.s. the atmosphere is under average as well.",3
382800,"I have been there 3 times.  Every time, I have to say, I am very happy about it.  I see many photos are their signature dishes!   In general they are all excellent.   The other thing that I will highly recommend is the OX tongue.  I think it shall be one of the dishes in all Izakaya, but I am so surprise NOT many Izakaya in Toronto has it!  Tsuki  is one of the very few that serves.  Make sure you order it!!",4
4431568,"I love vietnamese food and decided to give this place a try since my favorite ""hole in the wall"" joint closed down. I had the steak pho, crispy spring rolls and bun (vermicelli) which were all pretty good and flavorful! The service was great, but I was a little disappointed with our drinks. My Thai iced tea was watery and the boba had a heavy flavored creamer taste to it. Overall, I will come back, but I'm still on the lookout for a new hidden gem.",3
4746064,"The sandwich here is pretty good. The special with all the fixings is the way to go. Though I think theres too much mustard for me and not enough of their house sauce. The best part is the crackling. It just makes it that much better. 

Service is friendly and quick. They didn't hesitate to explain how the menu works and the sandwiches. Its a pretty tiny place inside, so its good for a quick bite. Don't loiter so that others can get seats as well.",4
1031951,"Fun lunch on the way home from Phoenix Sky Harbor.   Great place for a really good sandwich and craft beer.  Loved the decor and feel of the place.

I'm not a huge fan of ordering at a counter ... my only complaint.",4

2927194,"I've been here quite a few times since my first visit, mainly because I have a stamp card that keeps getting filled up with the groups I go with.

The price is a pretty good deal. $19.95 for lunch and $22.95 for dinner and that includes a list of special rolls, appetizers, nigiri, and even dessert. 

The service has actually gotten very polite, friendly, and fast since my first visit which is why I'm giving them another star. 

The sushi may not be the BEST in town, but it's definitely good and the appetizers are even better. 

I really like that this place gives out a stamp card; it's a big incentive to keep coming back. The restaurant is also very nice and clean, which is always a plus. Whenever I bring visitors from out of town here, they're really impressed because it's hard to find places that do ayce sushi along with appetizers in SoCal. 

I'm glad this place has improved since my first visit. I'll be sure to keep coming back.",4
3053084,i had an avocado burger with jalape√±os and onions ! it was pretty delicious although I don't recommend the whole grain buns here they're not that good . my boyfriend had a big bacon cheeseburger with a fried egg. it  was really good! We both had smash fries which were not too bad.  Don't get if you don't like rosemary because if had a strong taste of it. Overall it was not too pricey but service and staff was amazing ! Definitely a MUST try !,4
581354,"Do not go here! The manager is a complete moron. Like United Airlines, they overbooked and then randomly or deliberately deny people entry despite sending a confirmation email confirming the reservation. The manager is an overweight rude guy. I explained to him that I had my reservation yet the guy didn't even let me complete my sentences, talked over me and was rude. He kept saying, ""I called you to tell you we are overbooked as soon as you reserved the table."" Well, he called me 30 minutes after my reservation was confirmed. It's completely unacceptable to cancel someone's reservation. That's why you make the reservation in the first place. Remember the Sienfeld episode. Btw, I think if they're overbooked they're more likely to reject you if your name does not sound Caucasian... It's the colonial mentality.",1

This location of some reason, smells like farts and really bad. Inside and out. I had to leave to regain my appetite. My daughter kept making fart jokes because of it, which was amusing.
Seems like the prices keep going up too,at all of these.

4324219,"I haven't been treated this badly by someone I was paying money to in my life.  I had to go to the post office to get my mail after they removed it from my post box (I don't have the luxury of getting my mail every day). When I presented my ID the clerk asked my why I haven't picked up my mail, and since I don't think I need to explain myself to her I didn't answer.  She proceeded to tell me that I must answer her, so I told her I was busy.  She said that wasn't good enough.  I haven't been treated that way since I was in the third grade.

After threatening to stop delivering all mail to my home she finally got my mail which included several large packages that wouldn't have fit in my mailbox anyway.

When did it become my obligation to go out of my way to pick up piles of junk mail that I proceed to throw directly into the recycle bin, just to keep from inconveniencing the USPS?

4750379,Delicious and fresh food.  We started with the lemon cilantro hummus.  OMY (Oh My Yum) was it good.  I love cilantro and it had a strong cilantro taste and burst of lemon.  I ended up dipping fries and my gyro in the leftover hummus.  I had the greek salad and gyro and my group split the fries.  Everything was super flavorful.  My dining companion had a coupon for a free baklava and although I'm not much for baklava I had a taste and it was good as well.  Can't wait to go back and try more from the menu.,5
4865874,"One of the worst restaurants in Little Italy. Went there with a friend recently for a quick bite to eat. Friend got the chicken enchiladas and I got the southwestern burger. Expecting your normal type of meal for the price (enchiladas was $14, burger was $12), we were disappointed with what came out. Though I was told the enchilada was spicy and filling, the burger was a huge disappointment. A small patty, equivalent to the size of a McDouble was provided to me, but came with no sides, and a severely undercooked patty. I'm all for having a medium rare beef patty on my burger, but this was just too rare for my liking and too expensive for what you get. On top of all this, their advertised ""tall boy special,"" where you get a $5 beer is completely false. We got a 355ml can of cheap beer for &5. Absolutely ridiculous. Don't go here unless you're willing to spend a ludicrous amount of money for small portions and mediocre food.",2

5820454,Needed to get my nails done on a weekend trip to Vegas and decided to come here based on the great Yelp reviews. SUCH a good choice! I was greeted and seated right away. They asked what I wanted and didn't challenge me on what I wanted (you know how some salons are). The chair was comfy. Ha did my pedicure and Ben did my full set. Both were hospitable and friendly. They didn't try to upsell me the entire time; just talked to me like a normal human being. I'm actually going to be moving to Las Vegas soon so I'm happy I found a nail salon!,5

We were with a group of family and friends in town for a wedding and everyone was getting into this thing...my boyfriend, my brother, my uncle, even our friends in town from Norway (in their 50s) were all over this thing!  It was so fun!
They had a ton of stuff to chose from so it's an easy to please all type of place.  also a lot of seating, inside and out, so it was a great stop for us.  Nothing amazing and above and beyond but fun for a college town.",3
5745233,"I'm from the Midwest area, which authentic Japanese dining is very limited. Everytime I visit Vegas ( at least twice per year), I would make a reservation for Raku. The restaurant is limited in space and highly rcmd reservation (they usually seat reservation in one of the private booth/room). Rcmd checking out the bathroom which has a fish tank and heated toilet.  I've been to Raku for few times and these reviews are based on all the items i've tried. Sometimes, there may be a language barrier and was difficult to understand the type of fish or entree for the daily special. 

Skewers: The price on the menu is for one skewer. Skewers are cooked over a special type of charcoal from Japan, therefore you would really taste a bbq/charcoal flavor in the meat.

Kobe tendon - Rcmd sharing this skewer with others. The tendon which is good fat, would melt like butter in your mouth. Don't consume too much of it because it very heavy in taste. I would just take a bite of it for sampling. 

Kobe beef filet with wasabi - $12 a skewer for kobe filet which was a thick cut. It was good, but it was okay. Maybe it was too well done, I prefer medium rare. Personally, I think the kobe skirt which was thinly sliced tasted better.

kobe beef outside skirt $8- One of my favorite skewer, the beef was tender and tad of charcoal taste to it. Not too overdone and just right. 

beef tongue - delicious and it's a bit crispy and bouncy to the taste, 

Kurobuta Pork cheek - Very tasty. Love it.

chicken - I always order the wrong chicken or  different chicken skewer but it's all tender and juicy,

yellowtail $7 - Good deal for a tasty filet of yellowtail with glazed sweet sauce over it. It was flaming delicious. 

eggplant - direct flamed eggplant that was covered with bonito flake. It was not spectacular, but average.

Regular food item:
Raku tofu - home made tofu that is nicely presented. I usually sprinkle with the matcha sea salt and bit of the house soy sauce. My usual appetizer that i order every time.

Udon with foie gras custard soup - The udon is served cold in a basket and I think it's homemade because it's not the typical thick udon. The foie gras is infused in the egg custard. You dip the cold udon into the warm foie custard soup. Sooo hearty... Unfortunately, i flll up on the skewer and never have room for the udon.

Poached egg with sea urchin and salmon roe - pretty much everything mixed together in a small bowl. It's all raw and raw. The taste was okay and fresh, but not amazing. The texture was slimy Been there, done that.. ill try something else next time

Juicy deep fried chicken - fried chicken and the chicken was juicy and tender. 

Grilled rice ball -  a ball of rice that is fried on the outside. Cool concept, but i'll skip it and save room for the skewers.

Daily Chef's special:
rock fish - The whole fish was served in chunks of sashimi which was sweet and EXTREMELY fresh. My friend and I finished the whole fish. Soy sauce and wasabi is not needed, just chew it raw!!!  It's very reasonable for $45. Later, the bones of the fish was fried and served. This is one of my favorite fish.

wagyu beef sukiyaki - Do you know how difficult to find a restaurant that serves sukiyaki the right way? Most place would just dump the meat and the vegetable in a bowl and serve it.  Raku does it just like how it's done in Tokyo! The vegetable are cooking over a pot of charcoal claypot and the raw meat is placed atop and simmers to your liking. The waiter would crack a raw egg in a bowl and it's used for dipping for the meat. Love IT and i wish there was more meat to it.

Overall, one of my favorite robata grill. After the meal, it's pretty heavy and you might to drink some alcohol with your meal. The plaza that this restaurant is located is a Foodie paradise. In this plaza, there is Sweets Raku, Monta Ramen, Kung fu tea, Snowflake shavery ice, kabuto, Japanese curry, and Japanese Italian noodle (not sure of the name).",5

Most of the ""girls"", while in great shape, all looked like they could've been your favorite auntie w/ major freaky cougariffic tendencies...You know the one. Always making people uncomfortable with the sex jokes at Thanksgiving. Only one of the 7 women would ever be anywhere close to my girl crush list. Now THAT is crazy.

The biggest bummer of the show was it's lack of melanin. This show's marketing, even in it's golden heyday, has included at least one black butt in the signature pose lineup...a butt I was looking forward to seeing in real life! Sadly, those chocolatey buttocks never appeared. The most horrible joke was the ""big booty"" number where the girls donned Nicki Minaj-esqe neon outfits and shook their mini tail feathers off beat to a poor excuse for hip hop. Just delete this scene guys. I'm just gonna end this paragraph with Black Buns Matter.

5555435,"Nothing special. Seems like they try very hard to be different but don't focus on the important stuff. Food was mediocre and service was sub par. I called ahead and was placed on a list for a wait. This wasn't a problem because when I got there, I received a pager and was told I had only 1 ahead of me on the list. Once I was sat the server had a smile which you could tell was forced and after taking my drink order I saw her flirting with another server in the back. The manager came by later in the meal and was very keen on trying to be my friend even though I was still trying to eat my food and could be seen trying to just enjoy the half decent meal I was given. From looking around at the people that work here, very few actual look like they enjoy their job, or even want to work there. 100% would not recommend to other people looking for a place to eat. The only claim to fame is the german pancake which to be frank was nothing more than a crepe or a flakey pie crust. If I had to go again I'd probably just go to village inn.",1

Everything else was great though!!",4

Thank you MJ's for great food and being so close to work.

on a side note:
I love it when a restaurant that sells BBQ food actually smells like BBQ. I have been in a few restaurants around town that don't smell like smoke inside or out that claim to be BBQ restaurants.",5

I used to love those), and they have a few video game tables as well as other games like Connect-4, etc. you can play.

The food was fantastic, jerk chicken and curry goat in generous portions, but what made the experience special was the warm hospitality of the owner. He knew we were first timers and walked us through the menu, offering helpful suggestions throughout. The whole atmosphere was very Caribbean, with brightly painted walls, a steel drum in the corner, upbeat island music giving the dining experience an energetic feel. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone. Be careful though, the jerk chicken is not for the faint of heart!",5

Was told to bring in documents to local store.

* Proof of Income:  your most current bank statement or pay stub (Since I own my own business and am self employed I was told to bring last 90 days bank transactions to show income)
* Proof of Bank Account:  your most recent bank statement or a bank statement including the previous 30-days transactions.
So I gathered my info and went to the W. Sahara location.  First I was told eventhough I filled out everything on-line they need a hand written application.. so I start filling that out.. waste of time number one... while I'm doing that I give them all the requested documents... Then I was asked for my business license... okay it was never mentioned I would need it, but luckily I had brought it just in case... My business is licensed in California, where I moved from and I am in the process of moving it to Nevada, so I give them the CA business license info and I am told that the business has to be licenesed in NV... so I have proof of income from a bank in town.. why in the world would it matter where the business is based.. if I worked for a business that has its corporate office in New York and I work in NV and I get paid in NV how does it matter where the business is based?  This made no sense.. when I was pre approved on the phone it was never mentioned or asked where the business was licensed... They knew from my on line application and from my conversation on the phone that I owned my own business.. why wasn't it ever mentioned?  How was I pre-approved then told I didn't meet their requirements after I had wasted my time gathering the info they wanted and going to their location? 

I left and called their 800 number back.. explained to the customer service rep my problem and he agreed that it shouldn't matter at all where the business is licensed... he asked what location I went to and after a 10 minute hold (another total waste of my time it turns out) he connected me to someone who I believe was at the location I went to.  Again I explained my problem and was told ""That just our policy!"" Really!??!!?  Then how about you ask the question on the website or on the phone before you pre-approve someone and have them jump through hoops to get denied!

Our group slept in the room comfortably (I wasn't one of the people on the pull-out couch, though, so I can't really speak for how comfortable that was) and it wasn't a cramped struggle for the bathroom or anything. The previous time I was here, we had a little kitchenette, which was nice, but the ""kitchen"" area in the most recent room wasn't the greatest and was almost an inconvenience. It felt a little strange because people were placing their things on the stovetop, which made me nervous, but I also earned the nickname ""Mom"" during this trip, so maybe that's saying something.

My wife and I kept joking that we were all going to get a stomach bug just by being there, and sure enough today our daughter was diagnosed with hand, foot and mouth disease. There is no doubt that she got it at the IDEA museum, she hasn't been around any other kids that have had it.

I have stayed in nicer hotels at cheaper prices and haven't dealt with this kind of problem ever. Needless to say I have crossed all Hilton hotels off my traveling list.

Bath tub floor was slick, tried to be careful didn't matter because I busted my you know what in the shower. Just an all around poor experience and I will not be back.

Dinner there is amazing. I had the Mexican Ceasar salad with mesquite grilled shrimp on it and a side of Fideo, the only place in town that has Fideo. They could cook it like crap if they wanted to but they don't

4532375,"What the heck happened?! Ended up here for lunch today, around 11:30. Keeping in mind my last experience, I expected this to be a tasty deli lunch experience. Ummmm jokes on me I guess. Everybody's food was SO BLAND. You know how the best food is the restaurant food that taste homemade, but honestly you know you could never compare if you actually made it at home? That is what I wanted, but did not get. ARGHHHH. 

My brisket wrap did not have any horseradish despite the menu saying it would. I choked on the meat it was so dry. And the chicken salad was mostly egg salad. IF I WANTED EGG SALAD I WOULD ORDER EGG OK?!??? The marinated mushroom was just a chewy mass. Like they just whipped it out of the bunch that they marinated and put it on some bread. Not even grilled. So disappointed!!!

I am still giving two stars because it was fresh, just not good. So learn to work with the quality and you'll be killing the deli game. 

p.s. Sauerkraut balls were good, but probably only because they were fried. They were made with mostly corn beef anyways, not sauerkraut. FALSE ADVERTISING!!!",2
5604985,"I have used Fox many times.  They are always friendly and provide nice cars.  I agree with Scott L's post about the lines...it took for EVER for us to get our car.  

We rented a Honda Civic Hybrid for around $40/day.  Not bad for a Hybrid!  We saved a TON on gas in the 600 miles we drove in 4 days.  

I'll return to Fox again, but PLEASE get more people up at the desk...it is bad when people in line feel the need to complain before they even get to the front...",4
5017427,"So I'm from Kentucky and jus let me tell you bein in this place totally made me feel like I was back home. And I loved it!! I had a few things a la carte cuz I wanted I try everything! To drink I got an Arnold Palmer with unsweet tea (don't tell anyone in ky I did that) and one of my friends ordered the kool aid. It tasted just like a watermelon jolly rancher she loved it!! 

Because they cook all the chicken to order it takes a good amount of time to get your food. We were also there on a Sunday after church so there was a pretty long wait. Jus don't expect to be in a hurry is all. One thing I will say was a downfall though was how darn hot it was in there. It was almost uncomfortably hot. They are moving to a new location soon though so hopefully that will fix it!!

To eat I had the fried okra, a thigh, a waffle, and Mac an cheese. I also tried bites of cornbread and red velvet cake. My favorite part was probably the waffle and a close second the okra. Everything was super hot and delicious. I can't wait to go back and try everything I didn't get to try this time!!",4
1214108,"Stumbled upon this cute restaurant/grocery store in the heart of Tempe near the light rail. I was craving a gyro sandwich but got the Gyro Plate with Rice and salad. It truly was amazing and filling. I ordered the Arabic coffee, wow, it woke me right up. An amazing lunch!  I will definitely be back!",5
5693248,"Finally got around to trying Meat & Potatoes! Overall, we had some great food and drinks, but it did not blow me away. I would probably choose to go somewhere else for a nice dinner, just based on my own preferences for fish and lighter fare, but we had a good experience overall. Service was friendly and attentive, but we were there for early dinner before it got hectic. The cocktails were tasty and strong, but I didn't see anything too unique. I would say that the drafts were a little disappointing as they only had two or three on tap that were not IPAs.

In more detail are the dishes we sampled:

**Special Shrimp and Shishito Pepper Appetizer** 3/5
This dish was okay, but the shrimp was very salty. 

**Smoked Buffalo Wings** 4/5 
Solid wings, with crispy exterior and moist, smoked flesh. 

**Wagyu Flat Iron Steak** 4/5
The steak itself was phenomenal and cooked perfectly, but the accompanying potatoes and sauce were way too salty!

**Special Black Squid Ink Pasta** 3/5
Pasta was cooked a little too soft and the shrimp was over salted. The sauce was milder and less salty, which helped balance the dish, but overall was not too impressed. 

**Pub Burger** 5/5 
Get this! I heard only happy mumbles as my eating companions scarfed down this massive burger. I've heard great things about the burger and was not disappointed. 

**Vanilla Panna Cotta** 4/5
I'm used to softer Panna cotta but I enjoyed this slightly firmer version with Apple butter and granola on top. It wasn't what I would expect on Panna cotta but it somehow worked.",4
3187118,"Food was great. Thier pizza with smoked salmon and shrimp was delicious. ( sounds gross but i gave it a try ). Serving was huge.

1277661,"So I wouldnt have ever visited this place but a friend invited me to meet up with her while she was in town seeing family.. I ordered the city hot flavor chicken wings.. Its basically a buffalo style hot wing sauce, but tastier.. I was  impressed!  They run a great happy hour on their appetizers, its like $5-$6 each and full portions.. The sliced sirloin sliders with aus ju is yummy too! I have visited the place 4 times now, service 3/4 times kinda sucked but I like the food so go back. The bartender i had one time sitting at the bar top sucked. She ignored me the first 10 min I was there. I guess because I wasnt a guy to flirt with. The place is a very casual bar atmosphere.. Nothing pretty, but kinda a laid back chill ambiance. I wish the patio area  had a non smoking section also.
The one thing I hate is they have non filtered yuck Arizona water!!!! It is HORRIBLE!! I cant even gag it down. So youre forced to order a soda or beer.
 I go for the wings but the service and most of the staff could be upgraded to better serve the customers.",3

Everything is made from scratch so some things take a little longer and you may get your food at different times but that doesn't bother me as long as the food is good. Server was nice and attentive.

We also got the fried rice with no meat and it was delicious!!

954513,"Red Rock is where my husband and I spent our wedding night and we enjoyed it so much we decided to come back. We came back for our anniversary and were quite disappointed. We found out all pools and hot tubs were closed and it was nothing that came up while making our reservation on their website. Apparently it was noted in a side link about their pools but because we stayed here before, we weren't reading all the side links. That is a huge amenity to not have available and its a big part of why we came since my husband is recovering from a back injury and we looked forward to utilizing it often during our multiple day stay. We are quite deflated at not having better communication about such a large amenity being gone. We drove over 5 hours just to stay here and we were going to book an additional night this weekend but will be looking else where. The front desk didn't answer our call and when I went to the front desk, they had nothing to contribute to a better stay for our anniversary.
We are very saddened.",3

583302,"There was a lot of hype about the opening of Pizzeria Libretto on The Danforth in recent weeks...perhaps a little too much hype.

I had dinner here last week with a few good friends, one of whom orders pies to go from the Ossington location and drives across town to pick them up! 

The new Pizzeria Libretto location offers a cool space to dine or grab a beverage.
The pizza is tasty. They use fresh ingredients...sauces...toppings...yadayada.
That's what you get when you pay $15 for a thin-crust pizza cooked in an 800 degree oven for 90 seconds.

The staff -- mostly male -- were qualified, exuded that 'cool' vibe and knew what they were taking about.

The place was busy and I suspect will likely do very well on The Danny.

Yeh, I'd return again, maybe not on my own accord but certainly if a friend wanted to go there or if it was someone's b-day.

I still prefer Terroni.",3
2470214,I rarely do the review thing but I had to this time.  Super friendly staff and ohhh the food.  The garlic knots may be the best I've had in Charlotte... No joke they are baked perfectly.

5795922,"The food here is always fantastic...the counter people though are always borderline rude at least the times I've been there.  They've never been helpful with suggestions or answering questions.  This time there wasn't even ice, for the iced tea that had just been brewed and was very warm.  The food flavorwise was excellent though, I had a macaron and the chips with salsa and guacamole.  So I probably will keep avoiding here because I don't really want to bother the employees with doing their job.",4

576148,"We were excited to try this restaurant and made our reservation way in advance.  We had a 7pm reservation and only had to wait a few minutes to be seated.  We wanted the full experience so we ordered the tasting menu ($120ea) and the wine pairing ($70ea) for 4 courses.  While everyone (the waiter, his assistant and the sommalier) were very nice, none of them were in sync with each other.  We received our first wine pairing a good 15 min before the appetizer (a shared antipasto plate), so we didn't really pair them because the drink was finished.  The courses were then spaced far apart and the wine and food were not timed well.  You have a choice for pasta, entree and dessert, but they do not customize the wine to your choice of food and just serve the same to the table (for example, I had salmon and my fiance had steak and we were served the same wine.  It seems that they could have put in a little more effort.) The summary is that we went in at 7 and didn't finish until 9:45 and it cost around $500.  For that, I would say to skip this and go to Michael Mina's at the Bellagio.",3

She understands the passion it takes to do what we do, she doesn't take it lightly, and she is there any time I need her. Whether it's a routine groom, or I just found a dog hiding under a car, emaciated and painfully matted, She is there to help. Just yesterday, I brought in one of our seizure dogs. This dog needed quiet and calm and to not be too excited. She went back there and groomed him herself !!

It's a newer restaurant so I get they're still working things out, but we had a reservation and still had to wait 15 minutes past our reservation time (on a Thursday) and then it was at least a half hour wait for our food once we ordered. The waitress kept telling us it was about to come out and then it would be another 10 minutes each time. When our food finally did come out the pizzas were cold. They remade my pizza but there was no offer of compensation for the massive wait to then be delivered cold food. The pizza (once hot) was really phenomenal and the only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 3 stars.",4

5526856,"For the record I bookmarked this to review for a friend's wedding, not for my own, and no wedding plans in the near future. :P

My friends were married here several months ago and I have to say that with all the wedding chapels and options Vegas has to offer, this place is over priced and under impressive to me. Their wedding was pre-planned/scheduled in advance, yet when we arrived it was like a cattle call inside when it came to ushering the wedding group in and out. Other brides and wedding parties were waiting in the small waiting area, it felt less personalized this way. The staff was nice, but they moved everyone around frantically, which sort of made all of us feel frantic and rushed.

Sure it looks like a chapel inside, and if that's what you're going for great. But with red carpeting, old white pillars and lattice work it looks like a chapel out of the late 70's; seems tacky rather than classy.

The pros: they have a limo service for the wedding party, to and from any downtown hotel. They will tailor the ceremony to religious needs and wants, like the use of a bible or unity candles, etc.

The cons: pretty pricey - they paid over $2,500 for a pretty basic package that included photos. Also, they don't allow any other photos during the ceremony because the photographer doesn't want her shots messed up.

I suppose all Vegas wedding chapels come off feeling a little cheap, but don't expect it to be cheap on your pocket book.",2

Does the Sahara location only hire teenie bopper ditz's? One time I order almonds- the girl told me they were out (clearly the full jar of almonds in front of her was a mirage in my head)
Today my husband ordered a peanut butter batter something or other (the new featured combo ice cream) the girl starts making something completely different. I stopped her to explain what he wanted again. She proceeds to tell me they don't have that ice cream and she doesn't know why they are advertising it. I pointed at the peanut butter batter ice cream in front of me and said ""well then what is this?"" She fumbled around and said she didn't know that's what I wanted.

156071,"My first time there. We went during happy hour on a weekday. We had a reservation but he place wasn't too busy anyway. 

For starters we ordered guacamole which was made table-side, nice touch. It was great, and I am not sure but I suspect that the tortilla chips might have been made in-house. If they weren't, then they're darn good forgeries. They were very crispy and didn't taste like they came out of a cellophane bag. 

I also ordered a margarita special which was a Paloma and for whatever reason I got served a double, but they only charged me $6, so lucky me. Beginners luck, eh. 

For mains, we ordered an assorted plate of 6 tacos (2 each of pork, chicken, and chorizo), and a special dish of 3 pork belly tacos with pineapple salsa. They brought out condiments of a spicy mayo and a green sauce that I don't remember the name of. They made a point to mention that the green sauce was made somewhere in Quebec and not in-house. 

There wasn't much difference in the pork and chicken tacos as the veggies were all the same, as well as the seasonings. The meats are shredded in both cases, and well seasoned, but next time I would order a fish taco or something instead of having both chicken and pork, being so similar. The chorizo was spicy and nice, but was very messy and was a bit difficult to eat without getting crumbled meat all over. Maybe I'm not good at eating tacos, I dunno.

The pork belly and pineapple ones were the best, for me. The pork belly was crispy and went excellent with the pineapple. I'll be having those again for sure. 

And because it was happy hour, all our tacos and margaritas were half price, so we got the chips and guac, two plates of tacos, and three margaritas for just under $65 including tax and tip. Way cheap for the amount and quality of food that we had. I'm definitely a brand new fan and will be returning.",4
4049637,"It's PF Changs hello! One of my favorite restaurants. We eat here at least once a month, food and service are always great. Wanton soup, and lettuce wraps to start. Changs spicy chicken, salt and pepper prawns are two of my favorites.",5

2152376,"We're currently here.  The service has been horrible the last few times we've eaten dinner at this location.  So far there has been a long wait for a waiter/waitress to come around for drink orders.  After receiving our appetizer 10 minutes ago, we're still waiting for silverware to be able to eat it.  We've been told that they are currently rolling the silverware in napkins and we will have silverware soon.  Still waiting!  The food is great but the service at this location couldn't be worse.",1
2262675,"Nice place, but trendy in Old Scottsdale.  This is a place for the college students of Phoenix from ASU, Tempe, etc.  This is a place to see and be seen.  Many races are in here, but mostly your young frat or sorority friends.  I personally thought it was fun, but I can see families get a little bewildered by the place.  If you are a middle aged person who has a family, skip this place even though the food is good.  OR better yet, come in the late afternoon when the college kids are out and partying so you can avoid them.",2

2519861,"I hope this doesn't sound corny, patronizing or worst, racist, but I want to talk about the atmosphere of this place. In some wonderful family restaurants run by new American families who have come from elsewhere, you feel like you are getting the delicious authentic food, but in an Americanized setting like a strip mall or lower rent neighborhood where they haven't had time or money to try to make it more like home, or show off their culture.  I can totally appreciate and go with that and often actually prefer it because it's the food and flavor that matter to me. In Phoenix, this is true of Khyber Halal, and Da Vang, for example, although they each share with patrons some few homey icons I find lovely (rugs, shrine, respectively).   Other restaurants try harder on the decor and lighting, and it's a miss, because you feel they've kind of thrown up some predictable version of what Americans expect for their country's style, a la Chinese buffet with jello at American truckstop. Actually, I'm rarely a fan of restaurant ambiance, kind of dislike it mostly, especially when I feel I'm being courted (marketed) with that instead of the food.  I suppose the idea is to blend an impression on multiple senses to make dining an experience, but I have found it much more accessible and enjoyable when its not staged for me quite so obviously as it is at cool concept restaurants, not that i don't like some of them.  I think it mostly doesn't work, even in beautiful settings because the best eating experiences to me are intimate, even open-hearted, and its hard to achieve intimate when you are big and successful.  (Which reminds me, I need to review August in New Orleans for gifting me brioche for breakfast after an incredible dinner, when I was agonizing over what I had to forego in the face of so much lusciousness to choose from.)

With that preamble, I'd like to say that the atmosphere, the deep colors, the lighting, I don't know...the feeling of Reathrey Sekong, from its strange-to-my-ears name to the amount of space inside the tiny room dedicated to a ""sofa setting"" of furniture, is kind of wonderful.  Ok, I'm going to say it, poetic.  It's gently happy and softly lit, and just well  put together.   Kind of a perfect smile on the solo server, pretty food, a menu that is charmingly written.  Examples: serving intestines and asking if you've got the ""guts""), and, come on, who couldn't love ""student noodles.""  

And, yes, as everyone else here has said, it's delicious.  Thank you to the owners and staff.  I'll be back.",5

2677810,"A place that is probably out of our usual budget if without a Groupon, but a fantastic deal if you could snag one (2 entrees and 1 dessert for up to $69). It was our second time back and we loved it equally as much as the first time. We went on weeknights both times and there was live jazz music. Awesome band both times--great singers, but the volume was a bit loud to hold conversations over. My boyfriend and I were shoulders-to-shoulders both times and we could just manage to hear one another. So I would recommend calling to check before having a large group dinner.

We had the fried calamari (with shrimp) appetizer and we loved it! Portion was generous and we were both stuffed before entrees arrived. They always serve raspberry sorbet on this decadent flower bowl to cleanse your palate before your main dish arrives--yum! (Almost feels like cheating to have dessert before dinner!)

Main courses were fried chicken waffle and lobster tail. I didn't try the chicken waffle because my boyfriend cleaned his plate before I could. The lobster tail was so flavorful with the risotto! We had ice cream for dessert (up to 3 flavors) but it took a while for it to come out. 

Oh and the bread here is amazing!",4

It took another hour to get out food. Again... an empty restaurant. Then a meal didn't come for 1 person in the party and a burger was undercooked for another. Our drinks were left at the bar to the point we had to get up and get them ourselves. Still no real apology from anyone.,1

I had several estimates for needed landscape work in my backyard, and all were too expensive. I chose to work with Albert and Cactus Curbing because the estimate given was a fair price and I'd read great reviews about Cactus Curbing. I'm so very glad I chose to work with Cactus Curbing. Albert and his crew began and finished the job on time and within the estimate given as promised. His excellent advice, along with professional workmanship, turned my dead dust bowl of a yard, into a beautiful paradise, complete with a sprinkler/drip system, rocked landscape and plants and shrubs I enjoy.

4315058,"It sucks having to drive all the way to charleston and etc... for mexican street tacos but I usually suck it up and just do it. Taco y taco gives me that option to avoid driving down to the east side but taste and price is at a compromise. 

There is a paper disclaimer in the small walkway to the restaurant warning people that this place is open to foodies with an open mind and some of the options they have will make people turn around. Honestly though... those options are worth the risk. 

Interior: BIG, so big that there is a second floor to eat tacos. Some days they have a dj spinning edm sort of music otherwise it's popular mexican songs. Clean for the most part and they have someone rounding all the tables to wipe up.

Food: Your standard taco joint options with the addition of burritos, and street corn. I always go for the al pastor (spicy pork on a pineapple spit) or the lengua (tongue) always tender with no foul odor. The street corn is just like the ones you'd get from the carts, cheesy with mayo and a slight kick from the tajin. Their burritos are a hit or miss, miss in the sense that the white rice will be mushy and ruin the burrito. Otherwise it's on point and make sure you ask for the cotijas (mexican parmesan cheese) it goes great.

Price: a bit higher than your regular mexican restaurant but not by much.

Overall: a nice option to get authentic mexican tacos in henderson but places like tacos el gordo is still better",4
2818223,"I would definitely say this is just an 'ok' place. I really wanted some bbq chicken and steak and saw they had a combo on the menu. They have an old school salad bar for your starter salad and it was pretty cleared out, so it was just basic lettuce and some dressing. Not a huge deal, but I was really hangry at this point. My chicken was ok, but the steak was overcooked so much it was tough to eat. It was way too busy to get it made again and I was hungry.. sooooo I just ate it. I don't know if I would try this place again, it was very basic. However, there is a very beautiful view of Phoenix from the patio, even nicer with good weather. 

btw. the bread comes out with the food so eat the salad",3
4640944,"I called Duke of Computers this morning.  Thankfully they were able to provide service later today.  The owner arrived at my house and was able to fix the problems with desk top computer within a few minutes.  Very professional, honest and a Vet.  The $79.00 fee was worth it.",5
4623311,"Get lucky and wait 40+ min. or befriend a Local with the right connections if you want to be fed. 

For a non-local, I've had the luxury of being a semi-frequent patron of Lotus of Siam. I mean, there's a reason why the wait is notoriously long - I've heard that it's nearly impossible to score a reservation in advance. All of the food I've sampled has been pretty much on point. 

The Nam Kao Tod is my absolute favorite appetizer. Now either I've been under a rock for most of my life or that my Thai food palate is extremely minuscule, the latter may be a bit of a stretch considering I am Thai by blood (not a surprise though), but this is the first time I've encountered that dish. To me, it's the perfect marriage of unique flavors that Thai cuisine is notorious for. I MUST know how they fry the rice to get it to be so crunchy. It's amazing! Don't even get me started on the pork which has a similar taste to the Vietnamese appetizer called Nem Nuong. The perfect amount of lime is added to this dish which helps make it unforgettable. This is a must-try...unless you don't eat pork then I suggest asking for the pork to be served on the side. Get it - you're welcome.

I'd say that the only dish that I have ever been disappointed with was their pineapple fried rice. Go figure right? I mean, how can you mess up fried rice? Well, I shouldn't say mess up... I guess you can say that I was taken aback by the strong, Indian curry flavor which masked the entire dish. Like I said earlier, I've had my fair share of pineapple fried rice due to my previous experience with working at a Thai restaurant and being Thai so I have a pretty good sense of what to expect. It may be dependent upon individual tastes, but I personally think that the strong curry flavor really throws off the flavoring of the dish. I mean, it was so strong that I couldn't even finish my dish and I didn't even bother eating my leftovers (and I'm the leftovers Queen). Would I order this dish again? No, there are many other dishes to choose from, and if you are going to order this, be prepared for its' strong taste of curry.",4

We arrived and Taryn greeted us to help us pick out some of the weapons we wanted to shoot. After signing the various waivers, we met our RSO Chris.

The meat is really good, the sides are hit or miss but overall not bad, they have a few beers on tap, and the water is good (which counts for a lot honestly). The atmosphere is lacking and the staff seems a little inexperienced, but nothing that would keep me from giving them another try. Also we were there pretty late so we didn't see what it is like when they are busy. 
My husband said the ribs were some of the best he's had, very meaty and tender. The brisket was excellent and the pulled pork was tasty but a little too smoky for my palate, would probably make a really good sandwich though.",4

The last time I was here was with my best friend, who had befriended the bartender and demanded that I tag along and enjoy the drinks that the two of the came up with. Well, us not caring about pop sport culture did not know it was a game night, and so struggled to find seats at the bar. Her friend the bartender took a while to get us our drinks, which was fine since he had to service the whole place. But then came the food fiasco. First, it took fifteen minutes for us to put in our order. Then it took twenty minutes for the order to go through. Which isn't all that bad considering, but the thing was, we only ordered appetizers. I got fried pickles and she got the sampler plate. I was approached by a waiter with two baskets of fried pickles who asked me if I had order some. I said yes, and they gave me a basket. Turns out the people next to us had ordered two baskets of fried pickles. I basically just jacked their pickles.
I didn't know this until much, much, much later when my friend got her plate and they gave me another basket of fried pickles. The bill was only for one as well. I seriously hope those people didn't end up paying for two.

I paid for the sandwich and looked at my receipt and noticed they rang up something else. The girl at the window hands me my sandwich and I can tell the bag is a lot heavier than it should be. I look at the wrapping and can tell it is not what I ordered. I hand it back and say I wanted the sliced turkey sandwich and the girl hands it back to her co workers. She explains to them what I asked for and I can hear the employees arguing over what it is that I want and how to make this sandwich. Instead of clarifying with me what is it that I want they make another wrong sandwich and I finally say I wanted a refund because 10 minutes had passed since I arrived to the Dunkin Donuts. In the background I hear more conversation from the employees saying ""this isn't Starbucks and you can't order secret menu items"" with the manager Kathy standing there with them. Kathy comes to the window and says it's not a menu item they carry, which is fine HAD THEY EXPLAINED that from the get go. The reason I was upset was the lack of respect by the employees and the manager standing with them allowing that type of conversation to take place where I can hear. I asked for Kathy's supervisor who she said was currently out of town and I could fill out a survey if I was dissatisfied. I will NEVER go back to Dunkin Donuts.

The understated decor is reminiscent of a simple yet sophisticated Italian country villa, and the general aura is relaxed and welcoming. 

Every person on the wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable and the managers were gracious and accommodating. Because it was our anniversary we each received a complimentary glass of Bastianich's own Brut upon arrival (normally $14 a pop), but more notably, because we are locals, we received 15 % off our entire bill. I believe Batali is the only chef thus far to offer such a discount on a regular basis, and he should be commended for it. 

For an appetizer we ordered the pappardelle with 'porcini trifolati,' or cooked porcini mushrooms($22). Porcini mushrooms are my favorite mushroom. They are generally large and have a sponge-like underside rather than gills, giving them a kind of chewy yet slippery texture. When I saw porcini I got incredibly excited because the only place I have seen fresh porcini mushrooms in the states is at the Ferry Building farmer's market in San Francisco. While living in Italy they could be found everywhere in the Fall, even at road stands, and I frequently ordered this exact dish whenever I could. Needless to say I was truly disappointed when the dish came out full of shitakes and other varieties of mushrooms, with nothing like the porcinis I know and love. If the menu had just said 'pappardelle with mushrooms' I would have been completely satisfied, as the pasta was beautifully home-made and tossed in a light yet buttery sauce. Sadly, this misrepresentation showed up more than once on the menu. Our spinach side was supposed to have cherry peppers to give a kick, yet didn't, and our 'spring peas with pancetta' turned out to be snow peas. 

The steak was the real showstopper of the meal. I try to be frugal when dining out, but as a self-proclaimed foodie I am also willing to pay big money for something novel and ridiculously good. That something today was the 240 day dry-aged steak that cost $100 an inch. Dry-aging of beef is basically the controlled rotting of the exterior of the meat in a cold environment that results in the formation of a skin, or pellicle, that is then removed prior to cooking. It is an expensive process and therefore results in better, but less frugal, cuts of meat. Most well-marbled high grade meat is dry-aged for some amount of time as it dramatically enhances and concentrates the flavor, but this time can range from a few weeks to about the 240 days given the riserva steak here (we were told the slaughter date for our beef was circa early August, 2009). A second manager prepared it for us tableside by skillfully slicing it on a wooden board and drizzling it with the chef's recommendation of a little olive oil and a sprinkle of salt. We ordered the horseradish black pepper zabaglione as an accompanying sauce, but despite its ethereal qualities, it was utterly unnecessary and almost felt like a sin to use on this particular piece of meat. The inherent flavors of the steak were not powerful enough to stand up to it, and only by eating the steak alone could you truly appreciate the process and time required to create such a masterpiece. The wait staff described the flavor as earthy, but for me it was as if the aroma you get when you first walk into a fabulous cheese store (such as Murray's in the West Village) found its way into the meat and then ultimately into your mouth in a subtle yet obvious way. Combine that with the intensely flavored juices of the best quality steak you can buy and the result is unlike anything you've had before. As I continued to analyze the complexity of flavors twinkling in my mouth I looked over at my husband and saw teardrops welling in his eyes. When he noticed I was looking at him he said, ""I'll cry over meat, I don't give a f*#!."" I was hoping he was tearing up over how happy he felt to be married to me, but no, it was the steak he was feeling such a fondness for. I really wasn't hurt at all because I felt the same, and in all fairness, you can't have a steak like that everyday for the rest of your life. 

As far as Strip restaurants go, I would be more inclined to come back here rather than try some of the other celebrity chef restaurants I haven't yet been to. Usually you don't get what you pay for, but I felt the prices charged here were deserved. To boot, the service and ambiance were top notch without being stuffy. If you are looking for a special occasion place, Carnevino is now on my list of top ten Strip restaurants.

4382415,"A well maintained trail for walking, running, or biking. The trail is actually paved with dirt trails below in several areas. One could get a few miles in on this trail and make it even longer by joining up with The Arroyo Grande Sports Complex. There are even scenic stop offs with picnic tables.

Even though the trail crosses several major roads the trail is very quiet and relaxing as it cuts through residential neighborhoods. Each major road has an underground path so that you don't have to cross busy roads. I was glad to find this option as it seems like a much safer way to travel the path. 

The path was free of garbage and animal waste. We saw volunteers cleaning up the area close to the wash as we walked too. I was glad to see that not only does the city maintain the path, but the public using the trail takes pride in keeping it clean. The area around the path was also prettier than I expected with green grass in areas and trees along the trail that were well cared for too.",5

I enjoyed the show because it wasn't too long and overdone. I liked Bette Midler a lot. But I loved Brittany and Pink (same Diva). The Whitney Houston DIva was too old to really pull it off, but she was beautiful. Each ""Diva"" came out, sung two songs and we were on to the next one. Well the hostess comes out after each performance. She was very funny and after meeting her after the show, I learned that we lived in the same neighborhood in Oakland at one time. Without spoiling what the hostess does at the end of the show, let's just say she blew my mind and I am headed to CVS like she recommended.",4

I have stopped in for lunch a few times during my work day, and haven't been disappointed by the big tastes and big portions they offer. I typically save half of my sandwich for the next day; their sandwiches are huge and loaded with ingredients. This makes up for the average sandwich cost of $8-10, making it into two $4-5 lunches for those without a gigantic appetite.",4
4797215,"My boyfriend and I went to dinner here last night and we weren't disappointed. We ordered the Tuna Tartare and Crab Cakes as appetizers. The tuna was very fresh and delicious. The portion was a good size for us to share. The crab cakes were good as well, but not the best I've had. I would still recommend them if you're a crab fan though!

I ordered the beef short rib ravioli and really enjoyed it! It was served with a delicious sauce and was topped with some delicious vegetables. I love my veggies! I had a delicious passion fruit iced tea and my glass was never empty. Our servers were very attentive.

My boyfriend ordered the Beef Short Rib entree and it was tender and flavorful. The portion was a very good size, so we were both quite full after our entrees. Despite this, we decided to give their desserts a try. We ordered the Pineapple Upside Down Cake, but it was way too sweet for my taste. The sorbet it was served with did help tone it down a bit, but it was still too sweet for me. This is a place I may have to visit again.",4

-They've been having a sale recently on their meat ""buy 1 get 1 free.""

I also tried their Queso for the very first time and it was very good as well.

Fine I look around and finally the same guy comes outside and I ask what I need to qualify , and he says go ""apply online and we will see if we can qualify you"" . Omg . How rude .

2104044,"We won't be going back again. This is our second visit and while the first was not amazing, this time was truly horrible. We ordered a salad to start. 3 bites into the salad and the entrees show up... so much for our salad. One bite of the chicken saltimbocca proved that it was made ahead or purchased and then frozen and reheated. The artichoke hearts were obviously canned and tough. It was awful and it was promptly returned. The spaghetti and meat sauce was passable but I did not try the meatballs my daughter ordered. The were so huge and dense, I can't imagine they tasted good, let alone the texture. We ordered the chocolate ""lava"" cake and it came so dry that all we ate was the middle and the ice cream on top.. microwaved for sure! When I confronted the manager and said that I thought he overused ""chef mike"" he knew EXACTLY what I meant and smiled, but did not deny it. Chef mike in the land of chefs is the mircowave... a HUGE no no in any professional kitchen that cares at all about the quality of their food... the biggest waste of $75 in recent memory... stay away!!!

We came here because my husband wanted something unhealthy and fried, but we should have used up those calories somewhere else. I had the chicken and waffles, and although the plate looked like a spectacle... being a spectacle is not always a good thing. I would only come back here if I was being dragged to it by tourists who use the moniker ""foodie"" too freely. Their cocktail mixes are pretty good, but again, more focused on looking good rather than actually tasting good.

The eggs in the sandwiches are weird powdery circles of processed egg. This morning, I got a bacon, egg and cheese bagel. The bagel was probably 3 inches in diameter. Weird! I ended up with a black tea, which was fine. Although I ordered a large, and got a medium...which actually felt like a small.

3862540,"The saying "" it's too good to be true"" definitely applies here. We sat through the time share talk last year and chose this location for our free weekend. I got the sense there is some sort of list of those there for a free weekend as we were pretty much on the discard list while we saw many others who were seemingly  owners treated much better. We booked the weekend in a suite for four guests as we told them we were with our children. We drove from Los Angeles and after sitting in terrible traffic arrived at 11 pm. Our young children were exhausted. After checking in we were sent to the guest services representative that held our parking permit hostage. She started in with the "" sell"" and when we explained we really needed to go upstairs as our kids were falling asleep she acted offended and said "" well I'm not done telling you about the resort"" when we got to the room the living room with the pull out couch was so small we had to move all furniture to the perimeter of the room to open the bed. It was not made up. There were NO blankets in the room. None. Two total towels for four people. Every time we called down to ask for these items we had quite a long wait. On our second night we came into the lobby to someone sleeping on the couch or passed out there. We asked for a late check out when we arrived and were told to call back Saturday night or Sunday morning. Regular check out was 10am. We called to ask for an extra hour and got a very clipped "" no we will charge you $35 an hour"" the staff was less than accommodating and certainly did not make us feel they wanted us to purchase a time share. We left feeling like we wouldn't go back to a Wyndham property if you paid us. It was not relaxing to hear people talking about their sale and percentages wherever we went. There were no umbrellas at the pool. No umbrellas at a pool in Vegas???? There was a seedy element here and I'd never return.",1

3108060,"Good lord, I thought this was a hotel, not a white trash penal colony.  Well, ok, in all fairness, it is not just a white trash penal colony, because it is full of trash of all races, creeds, and colors.  

But, in complete honesty, if the human race had a trash can, it would be this dump.  

I am, right now, in a ""non smoking"" room, that smells like the rugs were shampooed with chewing tobacco.   Or, maybe I just smell it from the next room, because the walls are so thin that you can hear a dog fart through them.  

Walking through the lobby, it looks like a frigging zombie movie.  That movie ""Leaving Las Vegas"" should have been filmed here, because being here makes ME want to drink myself to death with a hooker.  

There are two reasons to stay here:  1)  There is a blizzard coming, it is unsafe to be outside, and you are on foot, with no shoes, and you'll die before you get to other shelter, 2) you're trash and you want to be with the other trash.

4346881,"If you're booking a hotel for the glitz and glamor, the service and the gorgeous rooms, don't book at Harrah's. This hotel is clearly older, the maintenance is a little questionable but the rooms are surprisingly nice. However, I have only stayed at the Mardi Gras tower, so I'm only saying that from this particular room. The best part of this hotel is the obvious location - you really cannot beat the location. Right on the strip, the back door is right across the Forum Shoppes and it's walking distance to anywhere fun. 

One thing that bugged me was the front desk. Coming from hospitality, it's surprising how few front desk agents they had during the busiest of check-in times. We were standing in line to check in for a good half hour or so and the line went out the door. Once we got to the front desk agent, she was friendly, but no apologies for the wait or anything extra. On a side not, she also kept pushing us to take a smaller room, which we found completely odd. I assume they were either oversold in a certain room type, or oversold in general, but pushing someone to take a lesser room is completely unprofessional. 

That brings me back to my own words though, don't expect service from this hotel. That's not their focus. 

I didn't visit any restaurants, mostly because they didn't look very good. Besides, you're on the center of the strip, you should probably be going to better places to eat!

In conclusion, I would go back. The price was right and I'd rather spend that little extra money on a craps table or a yard of Fat Tuesday over staying at a nicer hotel when I'm only utilizing the bed for a few hours!",3

2599702,"I bought a set of tire from discount about 14 months ago for my wife's '99 SL500. When I went in this week for their rotation they told me they could not rotate the tire because the front tires were worn off on both sides below the wear points. This was due to the fact that they set the air pressures to low in those tire. They only had 14lbs of pressure in them, and they should have been at 30lbs. The tires were rates for 60K miles, but they only had about 10k on them. The new set they put on the rear had 24lbs in them, and they looked fine,  but they should have been at 35lbs. Discount would not stand behind their failed work. 

They are the ones who set those pressures wrong, but I could not prove that fact. They tried to say the chrome on my rims was delaminating inside, and that was causing them to lose pressure. That was total BS, because both front and back tires had matching pressures on either side.  I'll be finding a new tire store next time after this.",1

2297426,"35+ years of patronizing Roberto's in San Diego and in Las Vegas is now finished. Why?  Roberto, you can thank your employees at the shop located on Cactus (just East of So. Highlands Parkway), in Las Vegas. 

Earlier this month (March, 2015) while waiting for my food, a female employee began vigorously sweeping the entry rug located INSIDE the front door.  She swept in the direction of the condiment island and the service counter, all the while oblivious to the cloud of dust she was creating in the room. In a matter of seconds, the entire room was engulfed in dust.  It was so bad, in fact, that I was compelled to go outside, where I could breathe. 

Not only did the dust settle on the condiment cart and its contents, but it migrated into the kitchen where my food was being prepared. NOTHING was said by any employee about the dust cloud as it lingered in the kitchen AND SETTLED ON MY FOOD. It was DISGUSTING! DISGUSTING DISGUSTING!

No storage space anywhere in the units, rooms are small. living rooms too small and the water and trash used to be included now they are charging their tenants a flat fee which should be illegal.  Its called Ratio billing and their water waste due to broken and poorly functioning irrigation and sprinkler systems is not the tenants fault.  The group that owns this complex also owns a few other properties in the area.  My advice stay away do your homework youll be much happier in the long run.  You can tell by driving through there that half the complex is vacant ask yourself why such a prime location would be 50% vacant, not rocket science, you probably arent getting what you pay for.  The property manager while she attempts to act friendly always sounds pissed off with attitude, not sure what her problem is. I would probably rate it 2 or 3 stars if the units were priced appropriately for the condition and size, obviously they cant make them bigger so you have to adjust prices",1

The server was very attentive (sorry for forgetting his name) throughout our meal, and we split an appetizer and each had a pasta entree. Food was piping hot and not from a heat lamp (huge plus), and portions were such that a bunch came home with us. Will absolutely return and bring visiting friends and family.",5

4412948,"Simple tucked away little place with exceptional sushi. Attentive but not hovering staff, the right sized menu selection, and quality cuts of fish. When I hear about Montreal's cuisine, it's usually about French food, fatty cuts of pork, duck confit, foie gras, etc. I never thought to look up a sushi place, but the urge hit us so we went to the highest rated place around us. I didn't know what the expect with the Sapin de Noel (x-mas tree) but was surprised by how much flavor was tucked into these little things! They went perfectly with a tiny bit of the creamy sauce they provide on the side and a dab of soy sauce.",5

I had the Summer Tomato soup with Pernod shrimp salsa, the Marinated lightly seared pickerel , and the Strawberry tart with caramel tuile. They were all really good portions and very nicely flavoured. Service was excellent and fast. The restaurant was really empty though and it was filled with only 3 tables or so at the time we went.",4
3142454,"CRAZY FUN!!

I had a blast it was a Tuesday and of course the family has about 4 women who wanted to go shooting so we came back on that day and it was FREE!

The wait was an hour, so we had time to kill and drove down the way and had lunch, but we got back and we were good to go. We rented 2 ""lanes"" or whatever their called. One for small hand guns and the other for big rifles. Both my cousins own those guns, not sure if this place rents guns or not. Our group was about 9 people, only 3 people at a time can enter.

Having never been to a shooting range, it was quite intimidating, my bad for starting with the rifle because it scared the s*** out of me. 308 caliber, that thing was a monster. But once I got over that ""fear"" I was good to go. My sister and I are both pretty petite but we took turns with the boys and it was super fun!!

The staff is super friendly and are laughs. They are really helpful and BS'd a lot with my mom and dad who were waiting by the counter to go back in and shoot. We were there for about 2 hours everyone got their turns and we had a little competition. The sucky part is, I left my target sheet at my aunts house :(.

Anyhoo, super fun I bought a t-shirt to remember the experience, great beginning to my  xmas vacation in AZ.",5
1227694,"First off, I am used to dining at chain restaurants with par to sub-par experiences. With that being said, i wasn't too thrilled about this dining experience either. The place was dimly lit with no open blinds so it was like walking into a cave that reeked of old cafeteria food. Me and my friend ordered the fried pickles as an appetizer, the pick-2 fajita combo - chicken and steak - ""cadillac style"", and 2 beers. My total bill was over %70. The fried pickles were extremely salty with little to no breading. The fajita toppings arrived 5 mins before the actual entree. The entrees arrive to our table.  I noticed mine had a lot of extra meat. My friend's portion was barely adequate for a small child let alone a grown adult. The steak was very fatty and not ""heated"" properly. The beans were watery and very heavily salted as well. I don't think that each and every menu item has to be ""chipotle"" style, even though yes it is a southwestern restaurant. My only complements on this experience were a) the server was extremely attentive to our needs, even though she was more heavily focused on serving her family at the next table over, and b) the use of self -serve touchscreens at each table, which allowed for drink refill requests, desserts, paying the check, which was cumbersome at best, and game apps for the kids, if you didn't mind shelling out $1.99 for games that come free on most cell phones. As far as the overall food quality goes, I've had better, much better.",2

The location is a little bit off the beaten path for me, quite a few blocks away east from the Mont Royal metro station, but the pleasure of the discovery was incomparable. Yes, we have so many nice beer stores in Montreal and they all offer the wonderful products of the Quebec microbreweries, but this store turned to be special, I guess because of the endless varieties of beers and the knowledgeable person behind the counter, who helped us to find what we were looking for. The little tasting we had at home was dominated by my personal preference: the Wild Blueberry Blanche, which was an extraordinary drink that is may be closer to wine than beer.

5522208,"Color this native New Mexican girl IMPRESSED!! 
My family (on both sides) has lived in NM for many generations. So I would like to think I know my NM food (I can cook it up and I was raised on it.) 
This place had been on my list for quite a while now. I am always in search of good NM cuisine, especially when I am not in the mood to cook it all up myself. 

I had stopped in one Sunday morning and was unwilling to wait for a seat. So I turned around. Vowing to try it again another day. 
Well folks Friday (2/11) was that day. Parking on the other side of the chinese restaurant, I walked towards the entrance hoping I could get in, as it was a Friday after 6pm. 
My timing was impeccable. There were 3 open seats at the bar, but I only needed one. The restaurant is dimly lit and the aroma of smoke from their grill lightly permeates the restaurant. Smelled faintly of my grandmothers kitchen, as she still uses a large wood cook stove to prepare most of her meals. 
Taking a seat at the bar, the stools wobbled and I feared my phat ass would end up on the floor so I tried not to move around too much as I begin my wait. Admittedly they were busy and the place is quaint and cozy (aka small). . A couple that walked in 10 min after me claimed the 2 seats next to me at the bar and waited with me for another 5+ minutes. WHAT?! The waiter/manager walked up and handed them menus...as he turned to leave and fetch them some water, I turned back politely and asked him for a menu and water also. (Feeling a bit invisible as I had been waiting for a bit and couldn't get anyone's attention.) The man sitting next to me passed me his menu as he knew what he was already going to order. 

Receiving my water and finally able to place an order for a beer, I continued to watch the guys at work in the kitchen as the flames and red coals from the wood fired grill lured me into a daydream that distracted me from making a decision on what to order. 
Luckily to took them awhile to take my order. I couldn't make up my mind they had a great menu and some wonderful looking specials on the chalkboard behind me. 

Finally, I decided on the Taos Combo they had on the specials board, which included 2 Schriners New Mexican sausages, 2 bacon wrapped grilled shrimp and 2 rolled blue corn green chile enchiladas stuffed with cheese and lightly smokey cubes of pork and rice and beans of course. 
Once ordered it came out relatively quickly. Very generous portions served on their famous metal platters. Everything was delicious and well seasoned (simple). The flavors imparted on the sausages and shrimp from the wood grill were delicious and the shrimp were perfectly tender. The blue corn tortillas were real blue corn, not white corn with blue dye like I experienced at another restaurant recently. 

So much food I took more than half home for leftovers later. 

So why 4 and not 5 stars....I was pretty much invisible to the staff for the first 15 minutes of my visit. They did get busier later but they are experienced at handling a crowd. I shouldn't have had to wait so long initially.",4
1654835,"When there for lunch with my daughter. The place was very empty but it was during the christmas break.

I had the brisket sandwich and daughter had the pulled pork. Both were good, a bit too much sauce on the brisket for my tastes. I tried her pulled pork and thought it was better.

I took my mother there as she is 89 and has terrible hot burning feet at night and gets no sleep, they told her that they have a machine that has worked for others with that problem, so she tried it out at their office and she bought one for $400.00. It was a lot for her to pay out with such a limited income, but was so hopeful that it would work. After about the 3rd day her feet were worse and she was in worse shape than before she got this machine. So she called them and the woman told her to use it twice a day for 30 days and she should be good, so back on the machine she went and it got so bad that her feet were burning all day and all night, so called the office again, and the woman actually told her that if it is not working for her ""Maybe you better put it on Kijiji and try to sell it for $200.00 or whatever you can get for it as we do not do refunds""

I recently moved here about a year ago and I was petrified to find a new salon and have a total stranger messing with my hair.. Long story short my bangs got severely damaged from flat ironing, and swimming in a chlorine pool a lot, they were crunchy and felt like straw. I HAD to go in to get them trimmed and treated.
I came into Design me for the Opalex treatment on just my bangs to help repair some of the damage and get a trim up on them. Zoey was my stylist and I am so happy with the way my bangs turned out! I've always cut them myself because no one had ever gotten them perfect but she took her time and made sure they were even and they turned out absolutely perfect! 
The Opalex treatment is great! Better used with the take home product as well, to keep the damage from getting worse on its own.

5606380,"My husband and I stop here when we go see family back in California. It's a great halfway point for us, and it's the perfect place to detox and get ready to get in the family chaos or return to reality at home. 
We love the option to use the kid area pool or the adult area pool depending on how crowded either one is. The spa in the kids area is large enough that you can sit and have a conversation with your spouse without feeling like you're sitting right on top of the people next to you (large enough for 70 people we're told). The rooms are perfect for the essentials, you have a fully functional kitchen, which is amazing. The bathrooms are spacious and the water pressure in the shower is always great (this is a big deal for me, I hate not being able to get the shampoo out of my hair or getting shot in the eye with a stray stream of water). The adult area pool has a great little bar, and the prices aren't bad. Best part of that is being able to charge it to the room so you don't have to bring your CC to the pool. Great little gym on property. Gorgeous scenery if you want to walk around. Lots of day trips available for a price. There is an actual spa attached to the resort, and I'm sure the treatments are wonderful, but I feel they are a bit pricey. 
My husband loves being able to check out bbq tools and we will usually bbq a nice steak one of the nights we are there. The people at the front desk are always very helpful and if there is an issue with your room they can usually send someone right up.

I call the billing number listed and they want some type of number that I do not have but the pre-recorded voice does not allow me to get assistance.  Then I finally get through to a line and they are closed from noon to 1p.  DO YOU WANT MY FREAKING MONEY OR NOT????  WHAT A JOKE.  NOT GOING BACK just because of the hassle factor.  The phlebotomists and service at the centers are great, but obviously the billing department leadership does not have a clue.",1
4275104,"From the moment I walked into the restaurant to the moment i left, I felt the food and the service lacked passion. The gentleman taking the order was very monotone and it seemed like the staff just got out of a meeting where everyone got in trouble. I ordered the meatball sub and a pepperoni pizza. The food came out within 10 minutes which was great but when i took a bite of the meatball sub and the pizza, It was bland. It needed salt and pepper. I will not be returning to this place.",1

3067746,Against my wishes my friend called the restaurant and informed them about the lobster that smelled of ammonia. She said the manager was apologetic and refunded the dinner. It was the right thing to do. I'm glad that was resolved for my friends sake because she felt bad about the situation since she took me out. I may actually give it another chance some day.,3
2682109,"This place makes GREAT General Tao Chicken. It's honestly some of the best I've ever had. Sweet and tangy and sort of crunchy/soft. 

I came in with my parents after a long day of Christmas Shopping and we were ravenous. We ordered one meal each. (We also got pork and lamb but I forgot the names of the dishes:( )
Service was super fast, the food was served within 15-20 minutes of us placing the order.
The portions are also really big. 3 meals and a medium sized bowl of rice and we were done for. We barely finished everything. 

It's a super low key place, I always walk by it when I'm at school and sometimes I forget it's there. The restaurant is down a flight of stairs and the exterior is really faded and looks like a store.

The one weird thing is they used to have a huge menu but recently they've crossed out a bunch of options so the menu is very scribbled on and it's hard to tell what's being served and what isn't.",5
663137,"Here's my experience with Naima. My sister is getting married and we found a couple of makeup artist in the area. We found Naima and decided to do a makeup trial even though she had mixed reviews  online. So we went to her ""studio""  which is someone's basement. (Let's ignore how awkward that was.) And the first thing I noticed was how unorganized and messy her makeup area was. It literally looked like there was an explosion. Makeup on top of makeup. Products on top of products. Completely unprofessional. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and ignored it. But then she started her makeup. I noticed Naima was using dirty brushes on my sister. I was going to gag because it was so gross but I kept my mouth shut. I was honestly worried my sister was going to break out or have some sort of skin reaction, she took off the makeup immediately after leaving the trail!!Also noticed that Naima was using low to mid drug store products, she wasn't using luxury or high end products which is odd because the price she was asking for you would expect everything to be top notch. Anyways she did her makeup trial and it took Naima 5 hours (just makeup not hair) even though we told her we needed to be done at a certain time because we drove almost 2 hours to get to her. Overall we were not impressed with the makeup look. It was so standard with gold glitter and such a traditional basic desi look. Honest critic because I do makeup. The contour was off, eyebrows were overly drawn, way too much eyeliner at the bottom which made eyes look sunken, and winged liner was NOT on point!  Your average MAC / Sephora makeup artist can do better and are probably in a lower price and much more sanitary! 
Obviously we ended up not hiring her for the wedding. Looking at some of these reviews, I think it was a good decision. Would not recommend her at all! Just my honest review!",1
733656,"Do not drive past this one place! It's very unassuming from the outside but the quality & freshness of the sushi is comparable, if not better than anything on the strip. At a fraction of the price. 

Sat at the sushi bar & was served by Chef Oscar. The care and expertise he used to slice & create was awesome to watch. The pride he has of his craft was obvious. Check out the sashimi platter picture. That's Golden Eye Snapper adorning that platter. 

Besides eating with your eyes, the taste did not disappoint! Totally fresh, great cuts of fish. Chef Oscar added a bit of roe here, a little uni there to completely elevate the nigiri. Didn't skimp on the thickness of the sashimi, either. 

Great meal, fantastic value, fun experience. What more do you want?",5

The casino has no smoke-free area and  the room kinda smell of cigarette, even if it was a non smoking room.

Also, you have to be careful not to touch the things in the mini-bar if you don't wan't to  be charged. Everything is magnetized and as soon as you lift it up from the shelf, you're charged even if you put it back without using it. The employee at check-out removed all the mini-bar charges (we were curious and lifted some of the things in the mini-bar) and she told us it happened a lot.

By 2:15pm still no call back so I called again and was finally able to schedule someone to come out between 5-7pm and that the technician would call when he was on his way. By 7:12pm no call from the technician and I couldn't reach anyone in the office, I left a voicemail that was never returned either. By 8:12pm I tried calling again and finally got an answer, the receptionist said I was the next call. Finally at 9:13pm the technician called saying he was on his way. By 9:47pm he finally showed up and was able to unclog our clean out line to our septic tank. If I could give separate ratings I would give the technician, Israel, 5 stars for being polite, professional, and helpful.

5912129,"I stopped in here to get a breakfast burrito this morning because I was hungry before my flight. I took it to-go with the intention of eating it at the gate or on the plane if need be. I forgot about having to go thru security first, though. I asked a TSA agent if it would be ok to bring the burrito thru and they said sure, just keep it out of my bag. Nevertheless, it set off the xray machine and I had to wait for it to be inspected by another agent. The guy was cool about it. Basically he just said ""yup, it is a breakfast burrito alright"" and let me thru. But it would have been faster to just eat it there at the restaurant prior going thru security due to the extra time I spent waiting for that ""burrito inspection"". Ah well, at least I have wi-fi on my plane now so I can tell you all about it. The burrito I got was the ranchero. It was very tasty but I bit soggy. I get it that it has pico de gallo salsa mixed it but they need to cook some of the water out of the vegetables before mixing in the eggs and wrapping it up. It hit the spot though and I had decent service so I'm still giving them 3 stars.",3

3524625,"Went here with my friend because he wanted me to try out some Taiwanese food! My first experience was decent and I think I'd come back here to try some different dishes.

We both shared this hot pocket looking dish that was stuffed with some herbs and I think ground beef. I didn't get to catch the name, but I'll upload a picture so y'all will know what I'm talking about. That would be a dish I'd order again because it was awesome in terms of having a crunchy shell and being filled with savory meat while also having that freshness factor with the herbs. For my personal dish I got the bean bean noodles which was okay. I felt like I was mainly just eating carbs and they could give a bit more sauce and meat! It was like eating a plate of spaghetti with one serving of marinara sauce lol. The flavor itself wasn't too bad, they just need to fix their sauce to noodles ratio.

Overall this place was decent. It's located in a small plaza so it can be easy to miss if you aren't paying attention. I will continue my search for Taiwanese places. If y'all have any recommendations send me a message!",3

4161966,"I went here for new years eve dinner with my parents and my fiance. It was a prix fixe menu for 70 dollars that came to over 90 including tax and tip...before wine. 

There was one vegetarian choice per course, which is expected and totally fine when it is 3-4 choices per course. The vegetarian choices sounded good and I was really excited before going. 

So, the first course was a caprese salad with one very generous slab of Buffalo mozzarella, one slice of red tomato (a vine tomato I think), and one slice of yellow tomato. The tomatoes weren't great, but it is winter and they're out of season. The dressing was a flavorless olive oil and thin balsamic vinegar, and one leaf of basil. It was okay but would have been greatly improved by smoking the tomatoes, or infusing the oil, or even just using a high quality flavourful olive oil...or more basil. Or even slicing the cheese thinner.

Second course was ""crispy ricotta gnocchi."" This was where it really fell apart. They were battered and over cooked so it was just like hollow, deep fried batter, none of the tender pillows of ricotta gnocchi I'm used to with this dish. It was also over salted and just incredibly greasy...this coming from someone who loves salty french fries or onion rings. I couldn't finish them. The portion was also ridiculously small (I know gnocchi is always a smaller portion but these were mini gnocchi and only came as 8-10 pearl sized balls of grease) and I was really jealous of my non vegetarian dining partners who had plates of fresh pasta, but again, I couldn't finish them anyway. 

I was really looking forward to the third course, risotto funghi, with 4 kinds of mushrooms, because I love mushrooms and was really hungry and already disappointed in the meal. Unfortunately it was the worst course of the night for me. It tasted like campbells mushroom soup that someone had added *extra* salt too. There were clumps of the rice stuck together. The different mushrooms which I picked out all tasted exactly the same, with the same texture, as they'd been overcooked in this mess. There was one whole clove of garlic, but the garlic flavours hadn't penetrated the rest of the dish. It was seriously awful, and my whole table agreed it was inedible. I was really jealous of the sides everyone else's meals came with, like wilted greens. They said theirs was okay but the steaks they request medium rare were unevenly cooked and medium well done that medium rare. There were some generous slices of parmesan on top of the risotto though, and that was the highlight of my meal. 

It isn't like me to not be able to eat my food. I've been to many amazing Italian restaurants in Toronto, Italy, and other countries. I also eat at malls and cafeterias and 7-11. This food wouldn't have been good even if I were drunk (and I did get drunk on all the wine, since I was on an empty stomach as the food they served me was inedible). 

Everyone else enjoyed their food, but were a little disappointed as nothing was outstanding or particularly good quality. It seemed to be a case of them not caring about vegetarian food at all, or maybe their chefs don't know how to work with flavours other than just using meat. The over salting was really jarring. I love salt, but this was disgusting.

Overall, it was one of the very worst meals I have ever been served and the price was outrageous for something I'd be angry and being served at a local pub.

(also, I'm not sure how to change my profile but I'm no longer vegan, heh)",1

2627270,"This place had my attention when I saw that it was refined southern food! I was eager to try it out and secured a reservation for a double date night with some friends! 

The restaurant is just over the bridge to Southend and actually has a nice view of the city but they score points for offering parking! That's always a win when you are close to the city. 

We entered the restaurant and the hostess opened he door for us with a warm greeting. We were offered a large comfortable booth and our server approached the table quickly to be introduced by the hostess. 

The servers wear paper bow ties and full button down shirts... weird. The atmosphere is of course very rustic and they have a story of an old tobacco house on the back of the menu. It's very dark in the restaurant, mostly lit by candles. They have nice fire pits outside but it was a little too chill for us to venture out there. 

We ordered a bottle of wine for the table. Our server turned the bottle presentation over to a different sever and she broke the cork. They panicked and ran form the table to the bar. I think this flustered her but during a wine presentation you present the cork to the host (or taster) ESPECIALLY when the cork breaks. She didn't do this and I requested to see the cork prior to her pouring. The bottle was fine and we did enjoy it but our server needs to learn to open bottles for her own table.. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and assume she was new.

We showed interest in the Fried Green Tomato app and asked the server about it. She told us it was 2 tomatoes and said it wasn't a great choice to share for our group of 4 but we moved ahead with it anyway. First of all I think all apps should be served with enough for 4 ppl to have a taste. Let's be real that's kind of the point, to share with a group. It was small but it actually had 3 tomatoes and it was topped with crab so we all got about 1-2 bites. The flavor was really nice and the dish arrived promptly. 

We placed our order, 2 people ordered the fried chicken and 2 ordered the shrimp and grits. Our table also ordered sides of fries and Mac and cheese. The food was served in a timely manner. The shrimp and grits was presented nicely and reviewed very high from our friends. I was a bit disappointed in my friend chicken. First of all the dish is $21 dollars and it comes with one side of creamed corn. The portion is way to small for the money. I think that it should be a two piece dinner. Also the chicken was very crispy which was nice but it was very dry. I HAD to use the dipping sauce because it was so dry. The dipping sauce that comes with it is a jalape√±o honey sauce which is ok but the bright green color was a little off putting. The Mac and cheese was really quite delicious, very creamy.

They do bring bread to the table and the bread was really great and was served with honey butter! Make sure you try this! 

Overall the menu is a little bit limited so I may give this place another try but they are trying to be a little more fine dining than they are. Your food has to stand up to the price tag and the atmosphere.",3
1653551,"Had a really depressing meal from here, and I hope it was just a fluke because it looked so good online. 
Ordered from ubereats - all the pictures looked like these big stuffed sandwiches and this delicious colorful pasta and these big parm stick rollups...
Well, they didnt have our drinks and never called to tell us. So we had nothing to drink.
The cheese rollups were ONE. the pictures look like you may get a few, they'd be big and cheesey... maybe the size of a long fruit rollup and I could see straight through end to end - not a lot of substance.
The sandwhiches were awful. They were much smaller than I expected, and there was literally nothing in them! One piece of maybe half a chicken finger, a soggy piece of lettuce jammed in the back, you couldn't even see the sauce at all, or anything else... even the pasta, was just noodles with some olive oil. Nothing else.
We were so hungry, ordered $40 worth of food, and didn't even eat half of it because it was just bread and semi dry noodles.

3936235,"I have been seeing Dr Toni Vaughn (for acupuncture) and Margie (for massage) at the AIM Center for a few months now.  All I can say is that, this place rocks.  The attention that you receive as a patient is second to none.  

Dr. Toni is completely thorough and caring.  When you see her, she treats you like a friend, makes you feel comfortable, and really cares about your well-being.  On my first visit, we talked for 2 hours about my medical history and health goals.  I have never had an experience like this with any other physician.  

Margie is the best massage therapist that I have ever dealt with.  She is also extremely caring (hugs included).  The work that she performs is amazing, and she takes the time to show you activities to perform at home that will help with pain and stress in the body.  

Chandra, the office manager, has an ""on-your-side"" approach when it comes to dealing with insurance.  She is completely competent in what she does and has such a friendly demeanor, which is rare in a physician's office.

1692129,"So this place is basically the sizzler that was run there, with new management. The steaks are good portions, no leftovers. The steak and endless shrimp is a great deal. They bring out the shrimp on a big plate, so you don't have to continuously ask for more. It's not the best place in the world, but I would consider going there again. 

PS: Don't order the mashed potatoes, obviously boxed, and bland.",3

4951551,"This was my first time visiting this buffet. I had heard a lot of good things about it but I had to go and see for myself what the buzz was all about.

I came on a Friday night and as you can imagine it was pretty packed which is a good sign of course, and the precursor of what the food might taste like. 

Well I managed to get in the buffet, first impressions were that it looked very clean, it was nice and organized and all the food stations looked very professional.

Visually the food look very appetizing especially the protein area with good prime rib, chicken, and other various meats.

I tasted food from the Asian section , the American section, Italian section, and the Mexican section and I have to tell you everything I tasted was very delicious! 

I was not disappointed, the price to get in was $19.95 which is not bad for dinner and even better when the food is very delicious.

Before I left I tried the dessert section and the choices they have for dessert we're pretty good with a lot of variety. They also have a nice gelato section which visually looks very good, and fancy and the taste did not disappoint either.

Overall I'm giving this buffet 3.5 stars, it was a very pleasant experience and I will definitely be back in the future.",3
413063,"We went to this restaurant for some sushi and it was pretty good. Not the absolute best place I've been to but also defintely not the worst place...

Food items:
Soft Shell Crab - served hot and crispy with sweet dipping sauce
Spicy salmon roll - standard roll, nothing special
California roll - it was okay, i've had better...
Sushi, sashimi, maki combo - fresh fish and good quality

It was $65 to tell us how to use the wiper switch correctly, a $65 fee to fix the shade which was fair, but the $65 to check air in 6 tires was over the top to stick it to a yearly returning customer.  Adios Findlay, there are other places here that would like our business.  We got better odds at the gambling table!",1
5289267,"Been here, stayed here, and eaten here before and loved it. This last visit, not so much. 

Went to the M Life Counter to try and redeem MyVegas points early in the morning for breakfast. Upon arriving, with our kids, the wife went off to the side just barely visible to me and not close to any of the machines. Since there was no lines, I was immediately told any MyVegas rewards are not usable during Christmas since it was blacked out. 

I was disappointed, but I get that.  What I don't get, is the person on the floor and immediately told my wife and kids to leave since they are underage. Sure, I get that minors should not be allowed on the floor and it's not legal. But since I barely paused for a second to ask the hostess and was rudely told by the gentleman to leave before I can barely finish hearing my vouchers were not valid.....that was totally uncalled for. 

Sometimes, it's not what you say, it's how you say it...and this time, it could've been told and handled differently.  It didn't sit well with me and I didn't get a chance to voice my concern. So let me tell my fellow Yelpers to please consider twice before coming here if you want to be taken care of.  There are plenty of better options.",1

I really like the way the fries and chicken strips go with their sauce, good combo.

Update - upon returning home I suffered from food poisoning for half a week.  Emailed management but received no reply.  If you are forced to dine here I would recommend avoiding the sushi section entirely since they leave eaw fish out for long periods of time.",1
2602883,"I am from NJ and very picky about my nails. After we moved to the Charlotte area, my daughter found NiNi online. It is also close to my job, which is the reason I am here in the first place, LOL. My daughter made a fine choice. Although she has returned to school in NY, when she was here, she had service twice and absolutely loved Sandi. 

I believe the salon is open seven days a week, which I was surprised about. They are also open fairly late, which means you can go after work. The place can get quite busy and appointments work best. Sandi, Theresa and Sam are great. Sam is my manicurist of choice, but she is so good and popular, you have to schedule an appointment for the best outcome. Sam has a great personality, is very caring and always making sure she is not hurting you and making sure you are okay. In addition to providing a quality manicure that won't chip/lift for more than two-three weeks, she remembers your name and other important personal details about her customers. I love her and she is really good at what she does. 

If you must get a pedicure, Tau Le is the one to see. I don't know her technique, but her pedicures are literally orgasmic when she does the leg massages. The establishment also accepts the BCP discount card. Prices are fair for the area, I suppose. They offer complimentary drinks, too.",4

5361060,"Cowboy Ciao was one of my favorite Arizona Restaurant Week places to date. They put out a solid menu with some fantastic options and they know that Restaurant Week should be at least a little bit of a deal. (I hate restaurants that just toss three items on their menu that would've added up to $29 anyway.)

I had the fried mac & cheese which was delicious, topped off with a fantastic tomato-chile-salsa type thing. My only complaint here is that it was just this side of not-warm-enough. (The Mac, not the chile stuff, which isn't supposed to be hot.) 

I also had a good several bites of the girlfriend's Stetson Chopped Salad. I understand the hype. It's at once fresh, crispy, and packed with flavor--it's more an experience than a salad. Absolutely perfect and beautiful to boot.

The scallops with beet risotto were just fantastic. The goat cheese was a masterstroke, the scallops were cooked absolutely perfectly, and the dish was just the right size for a three course--three large-ish scallops. The risotto was tasty though it could've used just a little something to perk it up, but the goat cheese did some fantastic heavy lifting on that front. Absolutely awesome.

Finally, the banana cream pudding/pie and the bread pudding. Both hit  the spot, but the banana cream felt a little less special, if that makes sense. The bread pudding was fantastic, but definitely a heavy dish after such a meal. 

Overall, a great experience, though they're a touch on the pricey side... regardless, we'll be back... those scallops were too delicious to ignore.",4

The club itself is split into two area; a full nude side and a topless side.

We were only in the topless side for a bit, seemed super crowded and noisy. The full nude side was more fun and more relaxed. Bunch of different type of girls, asian, black, white, and hispanic. Most of the girls looked pretty good. The girls will really get up close and personal when they are doing their stage dances.

I did wish the girls were a bit more aggressive on getting dances, most of my dances, I had to ask for. All in all, probably one of the better strip clubs I've been in.",4

Our group of five decided to order all five desserts so we could try everything! We ordered creme brulee, flourless chocolate cake, lemon tart, pumpkin bread pudding and coconut cream pie. We all had so much fun trying so many different things, that was what made the experience fun! I told them I was going to do my first review on here and we had even more fun voting for our favorites!

3412672,"I found Lovetts when I was looking for a collision repair shop close to home. My insurance company sent me a list of 'preferred' shops and they all had less than stellar reviews. Seeing the wonderful feedback on line about Lovetts, I decided to give them a shop. 

From my 1st phone call, they were a pleasure to deal with. They answered any and all questions, contacted my insurance company when the initial estimate did not fully cover the damages, arranged for additional inspection, & handled the financials directly with my insurance. They called to keep me updated when my car needed additional days in the shop. They even fully explained to me how Hertz works to pick up/drop off rentals at their shop. 

When my car was ready, they informed me that my battery had died while in the shop. They jump started it every day to move it when they worked on it. I wasn't surprised, as it had never been replaced in the 5 years I owned the car & I'd seen some telltale signs that it might be failing. They very kindly offered to get the battery & install it by the time I came to get my car that afternoon, saying that they didn't want me to drive down the road, only to have it die. They even provided me with the invoice, showing what they paid and giving me proof of purchase for warranty replacement if needed. I'll just say that sourcing my particular battery was quite the chore, but they came through and installed it. 

When I got there, one of their wonderful guys had my trunk popped open and was putting a covering back on the inside. He noticed that my license plate light was out, so he took it uppon himself to pop a new one in. So awesome! 

My car was washed & sparkly clean. The repair work was stellar. I really felt taken care of & like they cared about doing great job. I will absolutely use them again & would send any of my friends and family to them. 

Thanks Lovetts!",5
4958531,"Thanks yet again to the Yelp app for finding my lunch.  I typed in ""soul food,"" and this place appeared.  It had half a dozen glowing reviews, so we decided to give it a shot.  Very glad we did.  Angie is very friendly, I stopped by before we ate and got a to go menu.  She advised me to call and order what we wanted, as the food is cooked to order, and it is not quick.  This is totally fine with me, I find that generally, the quicker stuff is, the less ""real"" it is.  And usually, the better it tastes when it takes some time to cook.

There are some mainstays on the menu (fried or smothered chicken, for example), and there are daily specials.  We ate at Angie's on a Thursday, when meatloaf is the special.  So, my wife had meatloaf.  This is a traditional meatloaf, tomato sauce, onions, veggies.  Very moist, went well with the mashed potatoes and brown gravy.  We also tried mac n cheese, fried corn, and okra.  Of these, the okra was my least favorite, but I still really liked it.  The fried corn has bacon and veggies in it, it was a style we hadn't tried before.  Both of us liked it.  I'd like to try to replicate this dish at home.  The mac n cheese, as expected, was fantastic.  Classic soul food mac, not based on a roux.  Very cheesy.  

I had the fried chicken.  I was glad I called ahead, because this dish can take 25-30 minutes.  Again, I don't mind since it's fresh, but I highly recommend you call first.  This is a LARGE serving of chicken, 4 pieces, with 2 very large drumsticks.  Both meals at $9.99 for the entr√©e, 2 sides, and cornbread.  Very reasonable considering the flavor and quality of what you get.  The fried chicken was seasoned very well.  I find that a lot of places are too focused on the skin, which is certainly important, and leave out proper seasoning.  Not Angie.  The skin was crispy, adhered to the chicken, and was flavorful.  That's the fried chicken trifecta.

The employees were very friendly.  The place is small and sparsely decorated, but we felt very comfortable.  This is some serious soul food, highly recommended.",5

Never checked back after that and dropped off my bill before I even started my main dish. I watched her pick up a check from another table before they left and she asked why no tip. They pointed to the cash on the table and then picked  it up and walked out. I was blown away by how much this person hated her job. Not once did she smile or make me feel like a guest.

3211556,"on a recent drop of a hat...we took a Vegas getaway for a couple of days.  we found a good deal on Groupon with the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino and made it a go!  
unfortunately...things didn't pan out so well.  I've been to the Hard Rock and like the vibe of the casino floor, the music, the memorabilia, and the decided to try the hotel and its amenities.  
the first thing that didn't go as planned was the fact that we couldn't get the King Size bed we reserved for the first night and so they put us in the double Queen.  I couldn't sleep the first night at all!  the beds felt like college futons - small, too soft, and uncomfortable!  I pushed with the front desk and was able to switch which isn't great mid stay.  But the King was way better!
The hotel and casino is huge! we must have walked over 10k steps each day just trying to get around to eat, casino, and pools.  Also, the layout was so disorienting we got lost a couple of times.  Didn't help when we drank - LOL.  
the food and drinks were pretty on the high side and it was unfortunate that some drink and food coupons were not given until the 2nd day there...why? i have no idea.
The pools were pretty nice...very loungey and helped to cool off the 100degree weather we got in August.  
Overall...it was ok.  I always do enjoy the music they play all over the hotel and the music videos constantly playing as well.  Its a younger vibe which is why I like it better than the senior  casino/hotels on the strip.  I hope the Hotel can update some problems since I'd like to go again if its a better trip without so many speed bumps...",2
864766,"Sleek, modern hotel that's smoke-free in the middle of the strip.  I loved it!  We stayed in a panoramic corner suite with a pretty amazing view.  

One big negative was that our a/c was broken and we called them 4 times over a span of 3 hours and the person at the front desk kept saying they were sending maintenance over to fix it.  My butt!  The thermostat read 82 degrees inside when we set it to 50 degrees.  We were sweating our asses off.  That's truly unacceptable, especially for claiming to be a ""luxury"" hotel that charges exorbitant room rates.  Plus, once the maintenance guy came, he said he was only notified about the problem 15 minutes prior!  We were pretty cool about it, but once my friend complained, we got our resort fees waived.  It's the least they could have done, but honestly, they should have just done their job instead of jerking us around saying they ""sent"" someone.

The decor is very nice and trendy, great location however the service was terrible.  I asked for a spoon for my coffee from 3 people before I got one & everyone else at the table used their fork because they were tired of waiting. We also never had our water glasses refilled or were asked if we liked our meals after it was served. Waited over 20 mins for our receipts after our table was cleared.

We were split in to 2 groups, advanced went w/ Eric and us newbies were w/ Daniel.  We stopped 3 times for pictures & water and then lunch, which was surprising good.  typical turkey or ham on a roll w/ a bag of chips but it was fresh and the roll was actually soft!  If you get a chance to visit Las Vegas, this is a must!  We had a blast & will do it again!  Planning to bring a group of us on our next visit!  Hopefully they'll offer this deal again! PS. you will leave filthy but very happy :)",5
4091892,"This place is AMAZING! :D First of all, my bf and I don't typically like hainan chicken (usually has this weird taste that I can't explain but know that i don't like) but felt the urge to order it because of all the great reviews and they were right! The chicken was soo tender and juicy and went SUPER well with that spicy house sauce. We were actually really excited to order the fried chicken baos (basically the main reason we came here) and boyyyyyyy am I glad we did! We really wanted to come back for another order of those baos but we had such little time :(

The chef seemed super nice as he came out a few times to greet his regulars and we were only there for an hour or less sooo he's a pretty popular guy I'd say.

RULES: Order first then sit, or wait to be seated. It is a small mom/pop restaurant so be patient for their awesome foood! We waited only a few minutes but found it surprising to be full at 2:30PM.  Definitely try the hainin chicken and those fried chicken baos .. my onyl regret is not trying the fried chicken entree :(",5
4558993,"We loved our trip to Red Rock! It was so nice to be away from the bustle of the Strip and be around nature. 

We paid $7 for entrance. We drove the scenic route and made stops to hike and take pictures. It was so beautiful and peaceful! The scenic loop map tells you which stops have bathrooms, which is awesome. I love that the visitor center has a filtered water station! 

Highly recommend coming here!",5
1284158,"Since I was starving in the early am after clubbing, I needed food asap. I thought I could make it up to the room and pass out without eating, but I was sorely mistaken and started feeling sick. Right next to the elevator bay was Grand Lux Cafe, and I ordered a chicken sandwich and fries before the kitchen closed. 

My order took what felt like my entire life. I told my friend that they must have raised and slaughtered the chicken before preparing it for my meal, because that was the only reasonable explanation for the delay. 

When it was ready, I grabbed the bag and ran upstairs. I ate it in bed and fell asleep directly. I woke up to a bunch of cold, uneaten fries, so they were apparently not that good.",3
2108681,"Been going here for almost 4 years. Never was disappointed and I was always happier when I walk out. Scarlett and Kat are awesome! They take their time doing your hair cut. They also do beard trim, although they don't have straight razors, they still do a decent job with other equipment.",5
4156822,"EVERY time I have come here, the people have been super nice and welcoming. They have offered me samples and told me what everything is and how to eat it the best way. 

I have been here probably 4 times in a 30 day span and I am never disappointed. I tried a torta for the first time and I came back with friends to have the delicious taste of what makes this place the perfect Mexican late night food stop. 

Oh, btw they have $1 tacos from 8-10pm and if you check in on FB you can get a free drink on the bar side or the food side. 

Definitely somewhere to stop by when you're in the mood for some delicious, authentic Mexican food.",5
4498543,This is a great little Irish Pub. We went in for a drink after dinner. The place was busy round 9:30 but by the time the live band came on it was jammed. The band were local boys & they were pretty good. It's a small venue & the music was loud but still good nonetheless. One thing I like to make note of...white guys can't dance!!!!,4
4820732,I'm not a big burger person but Bad Daddy's has the BEST burgers I have ever tried! We've always had great service and perfectly cooked food. Build your own burger is the best way to go.

4179506,"I have been here three times so far.  Very good! and I will return.  Being from NY, we are really picky about Italian food in this house.  I have had their large cheese pie..... three times, very good pizza.   Not the best I had but definitely tasty pizza.  I had the brushetta which was really good and I recommend that as well as the pizza.

We got some cookies/ rainbow cookies to take home.... these were good and I would get them again.   They were not as good as the cookies I used to get in NY but they were still good cookies.

The service at Montesano's is top notch, whether it was Steve, one of the owners or another lady who rang us up, the workers were always super friendly and very nice to me and my kids.  We have only gotten take out orders so far so I do not have anything to say about a dining in experience.",4

The people here are terrific with no pretenses and they follow the otf playbook well which means the quality of the workout and the experience is what you would expect. Since it is one of the originals to open, it reflects the old design and aesthetically it is not as pristine as the newer otf's. However, the people, workout and experience is terrific",4
5769536,"Literally just came back from this place with my bowls. Worst experience at a Chipotle ever. There was no line and I ordered 4 bowls for my friends and I. The first lady made it seem like it was inconvenient for her to deal with my order. She was impatient and completely threw out customer service. Their portions are incredibly small as well, you can tell they are greedy with how much they give to their customers. The second lady also gave attitude which was completely unnecessary. It was very frustrating for my friend and I to experience that, and would not recommend this specific location if you want Chipotle.
Just to add on, all of our orders were incorrect and completely disregarded what we actually wanted on our bowls because they were too busy being rude instead of hearing what we wanted.",1
5018663,"Lots of extra fees-including a $34 per night resort fee. NO fridge in the room & no coffee maker. I asked for fresh towels & shampoo & got nothing.

The room was clean & quiet. But the online price per night was misleading & I wasn't hugely  impressed. The hotel staff were very polite & kind.",3
3491566,"I've been here twice now. The first time I went I swear I wouldn't go back!! The food was underwhelming and overly salty. Like so salty I couldn't even eat it. 

The second time I went I didn't have much say in where we were eating so I just went with it. I'm glad I tried it again as everything was excellent. Especially the boar nachos. I even tried tongue for the first time. 

In both experiences the best, most unique thing about this place are the margarita flights!!",4

3973567,"I'd been dying to try the San Diego location since friends keep posting pictures of these giant fancy plates of food from this place. We walked in about 9 am on a Sunday morning. We saw lots of people sitting in the waiting area so we were expecting a wait but luckily the hostess just ushered us in. They have plenty of small tables available for 2- 4 people. Guess there were large groups outside. But by the end of the meal, the place was packed, both inside and out. Anyways, the first thing the waitress said was that the portions are huge. I already knew that and decided to split a dish with someone. The guys each ordered their own dish and ended up boxing up half of it. Hahaha. So I split the house hash with chicken. It was served in a heavy iron skillet along with a biscuit, 2 eggs and fruit. We were starving but it was so much food. The two of us had trouble finishing it. It wasn't that amazing either. The food is just ok. I don't know if I love it or will crave it in the future. It's a little bit greasy. I think their gimmick is just huge portions and I guess their food presentation is pretty good. My friend got the Andy's sage fried chicken eggs benedict (which is a Man vs Food fav) but man it's like almost a foot high, everything piled on top of each other. Looked really good. I only tried a bit of the mashed potatoes and chicken and hollandaise sauce. It was tasty. That dish was like $16 though. Everything is about $15 or more but I guess if it feeds you twice, it's ok. Hard to have leftovers on vacation though and I'm guessing a lot of people that come here are tourists. Oh and the other guy at our table got the combo with a waffle, eggs, sausage, and fruit. The waffle took up like  of the plate and half of the waffle went home with us as well. Haha. Oh and I have to mention service was horrible. Our waitress liked to disappear for long periods of time. She was nice and polite but nowhere to be found. Other people brought out our drinks and food. And we had to flag other wait staff to get an extra plate and boxes at the end. Man, it would've been a much quicker meal if we had better service.",3
5547889,"A Brazilian wax on Groupon brought me and a friend to a salon in Bethel Park. Marissa was the Esthetician and made our experience a really great one!

The procedure is quite uncomfortable, to say the least, but Marissa talked with me the whole time about school, work, relationships, etc. We were even talking about some intimate details of our lives even though we barely knew each other. But once you're bearing it all to see you kind of hit a new level of intimacy with someone upon meeting them.

Afterwards I had no ingrown hairs and the wax lasted a good six weeks. She recently moved to Sybil Salon and even sent me a text message to notify me. I never want anyone else to wax my woman parts as long as I can help it!

Thanks Marissa!",5
1157636,"We loved this place so much we went 40 minutes out of our way to come back a second time!

We loved the pizza and the onion rings the most! We are from Michigan and we definitely wish we lived closer so we could have this more often. 

They owner was extremely friendly and sociable which we liked and there was a young guy working there that we loved as well! Everyone was super pleasant and were a draw in for us. 

Not really seating inside but we stood and ate at a counter table. 

Definitely worth a try! You gotta have it!!!!",5

We were seated quickly and began ordering right away. I had their spinach and artichoke dip, which is what I usually get if they offer it anywhere. :P It was delicious. I got something else which I can't remember what it was, and the cocktail that was pink with the pineapple slice in it. ( I had two and for the life of me can't remember what it was called. :() My boyfriend paid for food, I paid for my drinks, and the prices were pretty reasonable. :) Overall, not a bad place to eat and spend time with friends!",4

2836208,"While Little Nicky's Coffee has a Queen Street address, you actually find it on Peter Street, just south of Queen St. 

This place is not that big and seats at max 20 people, but has the feel of an old school diner from the 50s. I managed to get a table at the wooden bench and got a toasty almond tea latte. 

This toasty almond tea latte was super yummy and it was pink! What's more delicious is the mini donuts, they make them fresh and covered in cinnamon sugar. Even if you weren't planning on getting a drink, come here for the mini donuts, because that's what I saw a lot of people do.

Little Nicky's Coffee is my new fave place so a sit-down while wandering around town, #sorrynotsorry Starbucks.",4

For their May special, we got two booths (one for couples with props, another with a backdrop for larger groups) for a solid three-hour event, unlimited photo strips and 30-day online photo gallery for $1400. If you do your research, you'll know that's competitive pricing.

The props spanned feather boas, giant sunglasses, and various hats, with print options for black and white, color, and sepia tones, but what made ShutterBooth stand out from other similar companies was their service- Tim and Alejandra were on time, set up promptly, and stayed upbeat, fun, and professional the entire evening... with 200 middle school-aged kids!",4
1441222,"I passed this place at least 50 times walking along Fremont Street to the El Cortez over the past several years. Finally decided to pay a visit while staying at the El Cortez across the street. 

Once inside, I was immediately struck by the size of the place. It's at least five times larger than I imagined from passing by outside. Before this, it always seemed like the guests were crammed into the front part of the shop, surrounded by glass on two sides of the building. Whenever I walked by and peered at the coffee-slurpers, I felt like I was passing an aquarium and should drop some food inside.

But my impressions after visiting are completely different. This is a place I can't compare to any other. If I had to attempt to describe it, I'm just going to date myself. Okay so here goes: It's kind of like Record & Tape Traders meets Starbuck's meets local art gallery.

See? Half of you probably don't even know what Record & Tape Traders is. But this is good. It means you've got your youth. Please use it responsibly.

The Beat is more than just a great place to grab coffee. It's a world unto itself. Sure, there's all kinds of excellent coffee. And food. But there's also an art gallery with some truly stunning pieces of work. There's a very large upstairs, too. So don't forget that if you decide to venture into the art realms. Adding to the vibe here, there are some cool classics being piped through the speakers and vinyl albums right there in the shop. Remember those?

Staff is very upbeat, friendly and professional. One even told me I smelled good right after I placed my order. Did I? Probably. My secret? MK High Intensity Cologne. And yes I have a Mary Kay rep. But hey, what a compliment to go with your coffee. 

This is a place where laptops and tablets abound. Deals are done, Tony Hsieh of Zappos grabs his morning fix, and introductions are made several times in one morning. I only know this because I grabbed a seat at a table, fired up my laptop, and blended in with the morning crowd.

And what an eclectic crowd it is. All kinds hang out here. The well-heeled, the working class like me, and some who had clearly just stolen their ipads from someone. A tourist, no doubt. But at least they have good taste in coffee shops.

While not exactly off the beaten path, the Beat Coffeehouse is less touristy than say, the Starbuck's' or Seattle's Bests you'll find on the Strip or under the Fremont Canopy. It's more of a locals joint and a very fun place to grab your morning jolt, or even just to visit. Just one more fixture that makes downtown worth whatever it takes to get you there.",5
1956152,"The absolute worse customer service I've ever seen. I tried to bring a bus group to the casino but after leaving over 16 messages with 8 different people, I received not one return call. I even contacted the acting general manager who of course I didn't answer the phone either, and had his assistant to call me back only to tell me they would not be able to work with us. I wonder how an organization like this stay in business. Well, my group of 60 or more people visit Arizona every year and we have no plans on visiting the casino ever again. I'm sure the area is full of businesses and merchants who would love to have our business. I would give this business a below zero rating if possible.",1
3716097,"Do not take your car to this nightmare shop. I would give them zero stars if I could.  After the transmission died on my car, local tow truck driver recommended this shop.  Being new to the area, I said ""sure, take it there.""  Big mistake.

I paid close to $4,000 for a used transmission with allegedly 40k miles on it.  I asked owner for paperwork showing where he got the transmission, so that I could verify that it indeed only had that many miles.  Owner refused to provide that.  But that wasn't the worst of it.  IT TOOK THEM FOUR WEEKS TO FIX THE CAR! I tried my best to be patient with them, but every time I called it was some new story as to why they still weren't done. When their various stories started contradicting themselves, I called the owner out on it.  He then started yelling at me for accusing him and his lead technician of lying.  

But wait, it gets worse.  After finally getting my car back, the ""new"" transmission failed within two weeks! I was stranded on the side of the highway about 130 miles from home. I called the shop to ask what I should do, and they said ""go ahead and get it towed to the shop and we'll take a look."" As it turns out, they said that there was a leak in some gasket and the transmission fluid was low, so the transmission was burning up.  Wonderful.  My theory is that they forgot to refill the fluid reservoir when they put it in. Regardless, it was their fault.  I asked the owner if he would help me with the $450 tow truck bill, and he refused, despite the fact that it was his shop's incompetence that caused it and despite the fact that he had offered me a ""12,000 mile warranty.""  

So, make that $4,450 for a used transmission of dubious origins and approximately five weeks total without a car.  Mistake learned.  My only solace is that maybe this review will help someone else avoid the misery this shop brought into my life.",1

441283,"Went to this America Restaurant on 31st floor of the Trump Hotel in Toronto last week. Almost on the last day of the winterlicious, we had booked ahead for a fixed price of $28 - Winterlicious lunch menu for 4 people. We were seated by a huge window facing to the TD Bank building with a beautiful scenery view. A very trendy and attractive decoration in the dining room made us feel so special and precious when sitting at the table. More importantly, all dishes came out so good and delicious with nice food presentation too. All servers were so nice and friendly that they had prepared a special dessert to pre-celebrate for one of our friends' Bday on that day.  Good fine dining experience at the America of the Trump Hotel. Will definitely try out a lunch or dinner when summerlicious comes in July/August this year.",4
4725486,"Sunday Happy Hour ALL day, do I need to say more! 1/2 priced Oysters and Lobsters and 1/2 priced small assortment of Appetizers along with cocktails and beers. We've been here on other Happy Hour days, but I think because it's all day on Sunday it doesn't get quit so packed, a stream of people throughout the day, maybe?

I can only speak for Happy Hour seating at the bar is very good along with service. The Happy Hour selection is very good. My friend and I had a dozen Buck & Rider Oysters, Steak Tartare, and the Dixie Chicken Fingers. My only complaint and I don't know why: The Flies are out of control in the Bar area, the 3 times we've been there so far (always sitting at the bar by the back entrance). I don't like flies near me or landing near my food. Maybe fly strips or something?

My sister ordered a Coal Burger, Sweet Potato Fries, and a small drink. I ordered a bacon burger with normal fries. This came out to 28 dollars with tip. After purchasing this, I thought it'd be a big burger, right? Nope! It was around the same size as In n Out's. The quality wasn't that bad, but it was downright ridiculous for the price.


One moral of this story: Just go to In n Out. It is better and half the price.",2

Recently I made a same day reservation for five and much to my dismay, they were unable to accommodate me for the times I needed.  (My error).  They could serve us an hour later.  It was a mid week reservation, who knew they were having a few larger parties.  I begged but no way could they give me the times I wanted.  So, after a lot of back and forth they said it would be ok to come in and sit in their ""living room"" have drinks and starters.  We did that and it was such a pleasant evening as we awaited our table.  As it turned out the large party was delayed and they seated us earlier than we expected.   We ordered our food, were served timely and had a lovely evening.   The food was delicious!!!!   The wine was wonderful......as always.  Thank you to the Tuck Shop for graciously accommodating us.

The wax was ok, I just asked her to clean up my eye brows because it had been a while since my previous wax. My problem was the attitude of the service. The girl asked me where I went the last time I got my eyebrows done, it's none of her business. Then she said I should never go back there because they took off way too much hair and now she can tell that the hair will never grow back in that spot. WTF why would she said that? Maybe I never had hair that grew there in the first place? I was so shocked by her comment that I didn't even know what to say. Also, my face gets very very red after a wax so I asked if there was a cooling lotion or something she could put on my face. I don't want to walk down Queen W with red splotchy skin. She put on something that made my skin burn, it was alcohol based. I'm not an expert but I don't think that's good for the skin. 

It wasn't worth the price and I hate being insulted.",2

This little place is just north of the corner of 67th and Bethany Home in a non-descript little shopping mall. Once inside I was greeted by a friendly young woman and I noticed that the inside was clean and decorated with the many flags of the Caribbean.   I had learned about this place after being on my Yelp app a few weeks ago. I am also happy I remembered where the restaurant was. 
I am a 100% vegetarian and I am always looking tasty and unique ways to eat my veggies! I ordered the chana and potatoes which is a a stew of curried chick peas and potatoes. I had the rice and beans on the side along with sauteed cabbage and plantains. i took it to go and went back to my classroom to eat my lunch. I have to say that I am a lover of caribbean food as well as a lover of Indian food as well. Number one, the portion of food she gave me was HUGE!! Number two, the food was FANTASTIC!! The chick peas and potatoes were tender and mildly spiced.  The sauteed cabbage was fantastic, a little salty and very tender. The plantains were tender and cooked perfectly. The portion of rice and beans was huge and they tasted very good. The rice was tender and not over cooked and the beans were just done enough. I have to admit I finished 95% of it because it was so good and I did not want to stop eating it. 
If you want great caribbean food in a clean and not fancy atmosphere, this is the place to try! I know that I will be back and I would love to take my wife there for dinner some time. It honestly was really good! Check out this hidden jewel and you will not be disappointed.",5

3733860,"For me, the place rocks in terms of atmosphere on a lazy Sunday brunch afternoon.

Live music playing .... quite lively soulful music. Makes for a nice party atmosphere. The first thing I thought of was, must get a bunch of people here. 

I ordered the drake breakfast. It was okay. Offered standard fare but the standout was the cornbread. Damn! I could have eaten way more of that. If you order brunch ask for a side order of the cornbread - yo wont regret it.

I was kicking myself for not ordering some other items that looked much more enticing like the shashuka or huevos rancheros.  Oh, next time.

Staff were friendly and food came out in a timely manner despite our large party.

Totally recommend for a lively afternoon of eating, drinking and hanging out with friends.",4
1257036,"Let me start out by saying I still have not eaten here... 

The pictures however are making me rethink my stance.  A couple years ago I was so excited to go to this restaurant and even got something in the mail with pictures that I brought along with me.  It clearly stated the hours breakfast was served and as far as the ad was concerned we were on time.  However, when we sat down and I tried to order the picture, I was told they don't prepare eggs that way past a certain time of day.  That I could receive eggs prepared the way they said or not at all.  Due to my prior excitement over the picture, and as a customer being told there were eggs in the kitchen, but they would not use them the way they advertised, I was very deflated.  It ruined my appetite, we stood up without ordering or eating and have never been back since.  

I am glad to see so many positive reviews, hopefully I will move past my grudge soon and finally try the food that aesthetically appealed to me before.",1
2944355,"Visited for the first time on Wednesday, Oct. 10.  Three barbers on hand so the wait was very short.  The cut and care received were first rate and I have difficult hair to cut - stiff, thick Asian hair.  The barber did a masterful job.  The result was greeted by high praise from the severest critic - my spouse.",5

2699308,"It was a Friday Evening, during monsoon season; and we decided to stop by this quaint little restaurant just West of 24th Street on Osborn.

It was cloudy and windy, and rain was threatening, The rapid change in weather just made for a wonderfully cool atmosphere to hang out with my Beloved. The vine draped windows, the hard wood flooring, and the candle lit cozy tables gave it an old world fairy-tale like atmosphere.

We were so enamored with this place's ambiance that we contacted one of our daughters, who enthusiastically decided to join us for dinner. 

After all, it was a free dinner while hanging out with Mom and Dad!

The menu was not extensive, but what they did have; they executed quite well.

I had the Ceviche. And the presentation and flavor of the shrimp was quite appetizing.

My beloved wife and daughter had the Enchilada and the Relleno, respectively. 

Both were quite delectable, and had a neutral taste to it. Not too bland, and not too spicy. Just perfect for their palates.

For good measure, we ordered Flan and Sopapillas. The honey on the Sopapillas were just oh so sweet. The Flan was a little on the tart side, but good enough to be enjoyed.

As we enjoyed our meals, the rain began to pour and made for a wonderful backdrop to this delightful meal, along with the very special company that we are so very blessed to have!",4
2634141,"Eh, the ramen was okay/good but I've had better. The base is a little bland and I would have liked to see more toppings. Also, they have a boiled egg instead of a softened egg with runny yolk which is traditionally served with ramen. They also had no chicken option, which I get is more traditional but at the same time it would be nice not to have to chose between pork or vegetarian. They also don't have fountain sodas so you're left with no refills.",3
1910108,"This review is only based on 1 brunch experience.  

I have heard rave reviews of this place so I MIGHT consider trying it again.  With a party of 12 they force you to chose from a small, boring fixed price menu ($20).  There were 2 types of omelettes and a basic eggs benedict.  You can also choise beignets or a side salad.  

For $20 I would like more of a choice than a breakfast with 2 eggs and a small salad.
Second, I asked a server there about the menu and why it was that way.  She acted all douchy and said twice ""as your hostess about that.""  Well, who the hell is the hostess?  They sent about 8 people by and no one introduced themselves.  

Service was good except for that BUT they gave themselves 20%!!! What?  First of all, I hate automatic tip taking but second, 20% is what i pay when i have good service and that should be left up to me...especially when you're charging $5 for an egg. 

I would have contacted this place directly through email but their site does not have an easily accessible email address. 

To me, this place is all hype.  I could name half a dozen better restaurants ...that are the same price or equivalent.  If you are in the area go to Upstream first.",2
1962818,"Mediocre- pretty sure it's a drug front because they've never had any other business when I've been by. Interior looks like someone's cluttered living room, complete with snacks and stuffed animals. 

12 piece wing, as someone else mentioned, comes with less than 12 wings- I counted 11 and one was the size of my thumb. Ranch it comes with tasted off, possibly spoiled or just a really bad discount mix.
Mozzarella sticks were mostly breading, which is sad when they're $1/stick and falling apart. The marinara dipping sauce was the tastiest part of the meal.
I knew I shouldn't have asked about their soups but the $2.50/cup of potato soup tasted like it was fresh out of the can, devoid of any seasoning whatsoever.

Service was polite but that's not enough to bring me back here. $17 is an absurd price for what was received.",2
2083818,"I was a customer for years. The manager was always accomodating. I can respect the patience it must take to deal with a daily influx of customers, and rarely criticize any worker!  Today, I drove over to print a few things and mail out a gift. I was terrified to see a man out front with two of the most terrifying dogs I've ever seen...unleashed (one looked like it had a limp, but was still intimidating! I returned to my car to wait for him to leave the area when it appeared he walked into Postnet. But I wondered if maybe he and the dogs had gone next door. 

  Not wanting to sit in my car all day, I called a girl answered. I asked if there were dogs in the store. She said, ""Yea."" So, I responded , ""Is that allowed?"" In a  nasty tone she told me, ""He's allowed to have his dogs in the store."" And HUNG up.

   I wish the owner should reconsider allowing animals into such a place (especially the ones I saw). It's a lawsuit waiting to happen. Mainly though, it was the rudeness I encountered. With all of the nice  people who'd appreciate a job why hire such a person who is nasty to the customers? Naturally, I don't want to return. Who would pay money to be mistreated or heaven forbid mauled?",1

The blue cheese fries, the cheddar & green onion fries, and the sweet potato fries with the Sriracha mayo. My Farmhouse was pretty darned good.  Hubby's Pimento was good too.  The blue cheese & the cheddar fries were both very good.  The sweet potato fries ROCKED.  Soooo good!  We split a Salted Carmel Pecan shake.  OMG.  The best damn shake we've EVER had!  We'll be back.",4
19947,"The grooming department service was terrible. The staff are not friendly at all and weren't helpful. When we walked in for our appointment, we got a ""what do you want"" style of greeting.

1642444,"If I could give this a no star I would! First off the dishes were such small portions, second the dishes had maybe a couple of pieces of meat in it so when you order a bunch of food, you'll probably get a single portion of meat in it! And last the service was just beyond rude. The waitress wasn't helpful in the food selection and she didn't even bother asking us if we needed the bill. She came by to ask if we were done and then walked away! Took us about ten minutes to get her attention so we can pay and leave. There's so many other places to go to for Thai food so don't even bother with this one. This isn't my first time here, when I went couple of years ago, it was such a great place but now quality of food and service has definitely gone down.",1
4906737,I don't know why I keep giving this place a chance.  They are nice but they do not care about the work they do.  The men do not know what they are doing.  They try to finish quickly So they are constantly hurting you. They paint over your cuticles so feel behind lifting and catching on everything.  Very cheap so I guess you get what you pay for.,1
2359672,"Ismael from EPP was terrific!  I was HORRIFIED reading these reviews - simply horrified. Our septic ejector pump sprung a leak at 6 a.m. and we contact our home warranty company (Fidelity National). They took forever to get us a name of a plumber to come out same day. Yup - I called and spoke to Mike and he gave us a window from 1 - 6 p.m., which is totally unacceptable. Just before 1 p.m., a Ismael called from EPP - what a pleasant guy!  He arrived well within 30 min. and by 1:50 p.m. our pump was fixed. He knew what he was doing and was so polite! (So glad it wasn't Mike! I had another plumber on call solely based on these reviews.) Ismael rocks!",5
2922139,"Decent place with a variety of menu items. Most entrees come with the bottomless salad, which I'm a fan of, especially the house Italian dressing. I've come here a number of times and have gotten the sirloin steaks, Hawaiian chicken, and stuff flounder, each item was pretty good. The prices are very reasonable and I'll definitely come back in the future.",3
5662245,"Came here and ordered the breakfast bagel sandwich, it was amazing. The egg, cheese, bacon, pesto, with the red peppers are delish. This might be my fav breakfast sandwich ever.

288326,"My wife and I were spending some time in Phoenix to resupply before entering Mexico on a long bicycle tour. We both needed to replace our rear tires and we ordered Armadillos, which we have found to be effective. I told them I absolutely needed to have the tires within a certain, ample timeframe because we would be leaving town. They said it would not be a problem. I even made that timeframe conservative. When I contacted them a couple days after the deadline, they still did not have the tires. We needed the tires, so we decided to go way out of our way to pick them up when my mother would be visiting the following week and we would have a rental car. 

When we showed up to get them, it turns out they had ordered the wrong tire for my wife's bike. They got the Flak Jacket instead! We were in a bind though because we were out of time and her tire was in serious need of changing, so we had to take it. This tire may be legit for commuting around town, but our field testing has shown it to be pretty useless for touring. A thousand miles later and we have gotten several flats on this one, but none on the remaining Armadillo that has over 4,000 miles on it. We do not buy expensive wheels that are difficult to remove just to have to change flats all the time anyway. 

The employees were friendly and the shop had the vibe of a good place, but this error has had a major impact on our trip. We are now in Mexico with an ineffective tire. They could have at least offered some sort of discount, although that wouldn't really have made up for the consequences.",2
3820780,I've been here twice after my last review. The service has been worse and worse. It is so slow including the food after we ordered. The salmon salad I order wasn't good either. The fish seems old and not cooked well.,2

5108649,"This is going to be a plain and simple review. I didn't have a stylist, I was bouncing place to place, always taking chance of not getting exactly the haircut I wanted. And I found out many times that the place I went to, was the wrong place.
     Then, about 3 or 4 months ago I meant Yvonne. I told her what I was looking to do and she just took over right then and there and she gave me the best haircut I've ever had.!! She's really really cool, down-to-earth, modern, really really experienced, and did I mention that she's the best stylist i'i've had?

5362888,"Whenever I hear ""ice cream cookie sandwiches"", my mind immediately takes me to Diddy Riese in Westwood. I remember living in LA and waiting in line for hours just for a $2 ice cream sandwich. So I was super excited when I heard about this new place in Downtown Summerlin. That excitement, however, quickly diminished. Call me crazy, but there's really nothing special about CREAM.

Hubby & I came here one afternoon for something sweet to snack on. The place itself is very open and clean. I like how simple it is to order: Pick a cookie, ice cream flavor, and optional toppings, and you're all set! I went with White Chocolate Macadamia Nut cookies paired with Banana Walnut ice cream. The cookies are freshly baked and come straight out of the oven. Warm cookies and cold ice cream sounded like such a good combination, but by the time we made it to our seat, our sandwiches were falling apart! I was getting ice cream everywhere with each bite of the sandwich.

Although the ice cream flavor itself was good, I was having a hard time enjoying the sandwich. Not only was the cookie hard, but I'm not a fan of messy food. Like, at all. At a certain point, I'll just try to finish the food as fast as possible so I can go wash my hands. That was the case here at CREAM. I do feel bad leaving melted ice cream all over the table. Perhaps we got unlucky with the ice cream or the cookies or the chemistry behind pairing the two. Whatever the case may be, Hubby and I both agreed that we have yet to find a decent ice cream cookie sandwich here in Vegas.",2
4542935,amazing bakery items and a HUGE selection. i could just stare at everything for hours. pretty much have every single type of barkers item you could imagine. the cookies are fantastic and huge - big fan of the peanut butter cookie. also the staff is very nice and helpful,4

Then I had to face the worst sales ever, they start talking about the price, it was $15 K with their ""rebate"", so I asked why the price is showing different numbers and their answer was ""car is new only has 4000 miles on it"" which drive me mad because a car that have scratched paint, spots on the seats, and 4000 miles is a used car, they're not honest about their online price.
They kept insisting that this a new car and they even tried to charge me for options, I end up yelling at them then leaving, but they followed me and tried to sell me the car for the online price and without added options but by that time I decided that they doesn't deserve my business.",1
5551678,Having been to Las Vegas over 30 times the lure of buffets has faded for me years ago. My date (wife of 33 years) has only been to Vegas 5 or 6 times so the idea of paying $26 and eating yourself to oblivion for breakfast is still a thrill. The Wicked Spoon is a good compromise in that they portion control what they serve and the selection and quality are not the usual Vegas buffet slop. Unusual items such as home made Italian Sausage and Watermelon cup with Marscapone cheese and Balsamic vinegar. Worth the price and overeating is purely voluntary.,4

4629135,"I don't even write Yelp reviews, but I'm making an exception because Chris, owner of Town Barber, is that rare dude who is loyal to his customers, and I don't know where else to put this story.

I've been getting my fades done by Chris since he was an apprentice barber at Crow's Nest, charging only $15 a cut. Probably since 2010. I used to get my hair cut once a week, cause I like to stay looking fresh. So Chris has cut my hair literally hundreds of times. Every haircut has been exacting and perfect, he genuinely takes the time to ensure it's so. I'll think I'm done and be trying to get up, and he'll be touching up this side and that part, grabbing his clippers to fix some tiny imperfection no one else would ever have noticed. The guy genuinely cares about his craft, and it shows in his work.

More importantly than that, he's a stand up, humble guy. After ending his apprenticeship at Crow's Nest, and moving to a full barber, charging full barber prices, he kept me at the original price, for YEARS after. He refused to change the price I paid, and even when I offered he wouldn't accept more money. A lot of business owners are ""customer service"" friendly, like on the surface, but Chris actually backs it up. He understands, just naturally as a facet of his personality, that long term customer relationships are more valuable than an extra $10 in his pocket today, which is a rare trait.

In 2012, I left Toronto and moved to California, then moved back two years later. I went to Crow's Nest, and found out Chris wasn't working there anymore and had opened up his own spot. So I went over there for a cut. During my first cut, I mentioned how I was looking for work. Chris referred me to a friend of his who was hiring, and gave me his email. I emailed him, we met up, and I've been working for his company for the past 7 months. So Chris helped me get a job.

THEN as if that wasn't enough, when I told him I got the job, he told me I couldn't pay for my haircuts anymore because I was working for his friend's company. I don't even know if I should publicize this cause y'all will go in expecting to leave with jobs and free haircuts. I've referred everyone I know there. My nephew and brother in law now get their hair cut by Chris too, and that's a strong endorsement because my sister is serious about her son's haircuts.

So if you're not getting your haircut at Town Barber, you should be.",5

2358803,"Highland Yard is a ""Pop-Up"" used goods mercantile selling merchandise that has been repurposed, refreshed and reimagined by pickers, designers and artists into home d√©cor and home and garden furnishings in the latest, trendy styles and color palettes.  It is called a ""Pop-Up"" because it does not follow a 'regular' schedule or 'normal' business hours: it is only open four days a month. 

There is a theme to the merchandise, decor and setup that the designers follow each time they are open.  For instance, 'Road Trip' and 'Endless Summer' have been the first two themes.  Yet, I would classify the overall theme and style of Highland Yard as one of Shabby Chic/French Country Cottage with some Vintage and Mid-Century styles thrown in.  Alas, there is an occasional retro vintage piece or bona fide antique thrown in that could have migrated in from the sister building, Merchant Square, that adds a bit of flair to each vignette.

I visited; saw a few items that I liked, and returned a few days later, only to find that they were closed until next month.  The concept of a pop-up business is certainly fun and unique, and getting dozens of vendors to collaborate on a central theme, setup merchandise and make it marketable to sell to the public is not an easy feat.  I can understand only being open a few days of the month to allow time for a change of venue, however only being open 13% of the month does not allow for much shopping time, nor does it allow access for the uninformed spontaneous shopper passing by.  Perhaps more shopping days would be an improvement.  A pop-up requires informed visitors through interactive, friendly staff, having easy access and detailed signage throughout to create an informed following, all of which was lost on my fellow shoppers and me on two visits.

All in all, I like the idea of a rotating or changing theme and merchandise that is fresh and different; I think it is important to keep a shopping experience novel and I like the excitement that a pop-up brings, but I do feel as though there is an aura of excitement and friendliness that is missing from the staff . . .  especially given this only happens four days a month.  Also absent is a sense of pride from the business or management.  I'm not certain where this sense of pride should emanate from, but it is evident with the absence of friendly, excited staff and a tidy, clean and accessible entrance.  Improving in these customer service areas would certainly align itself with the quality of the furnishings within. 

It is worth a stop if it happens to be one those coveted days that The Yard is open.  If you enjoy this style of d√©cor, you will probably find an item of interest making it worth your while to stop in.  Perhaps in a few months, when some of the newness wears off, I will return and visit again . . . let's just hope I choose the correct four days to do so.

It was nice and exactly what my friend and I were looking for, a quiet place where we could talk without a fedora or black rimmed glasses in sight. 
The bartender was nice and the feel of the place was indifferent, which was great since everyone kept to their own business.
We only had one crazy guy kind of follow me and my girl around but his attempts to be subtle was futile because of the size of the place.
Overall I would go back and leave any Scottsdale loving people to stand in their lines outside the Sandbar and to pay cover at Martini Ranch.

This particular time, we seemed to be the victim of our server going on break and their being a breakdown in communication or coordination. In any case, we had to  wait a while before our drinks were refilled and my salad was forgotten. Our server was nice and apologetic so no worries.

I used to love this place, and it saddens me to have to write a semi-poor review. 

They do have good pastas and pizzas, once they had a ""Seafood Pizza"" which was on a special menu, that was absolutely incredible.

Now as for my recent negative experience. We were there for a friends birthday, and my sister ordered a pizza with Gorgonzola cheese. Once the pizza arrived at the table, a gross smelling odour filled the air. Hesitant to even take a bite of her pizza, she finally did, and believe it or not the pizza tasted as foul as it smelled. 

She called the waiter over, and explained the situation, and his response was ""that's how Gorgonzola cheese smells."" Clearly this is no proper way to handle a situation of the sort. When she asked to speak to the manager (who I believe is also the owner) he pretty much had the same response and did not offer to swap the pizza for another one. Unacceptable.

Luckily amongst the 5 of us, there was plenty of pizza and pasta to go around, but this experience has left me outraged. The pizza sat at the table for the duration of the meal, without anyone touching it. No compensation offered.

Not gonna lie, in time I will probably return since the food is really good, and it's a fun spot to eat at. But a brush up on proper customer service is definitely needed here.",3

They have some pretty good scents you can't get elsewhere. But some are hit and misses. I got a really stale one once that smelled like stale water. They would not replace it. Also be wary of the reviews of each fragrances. They often don't post your negative reviews, and post all of your positive reviews.  This kind of makes it misleading and false. 

Containers:
I usually get the discounted ones. Products are pretty good. BUT someone can't count in their packaging dept. They always give you less than what is specified. I am always missing a cap or something. They would not resend the missing ones to you.

Customer service: 
Really bad. They don't resend missing pieces or bad products. They also aren't knowledgeable about the products they sell. I got quite a few rude ones. 

Butters:
I bought cocoa butter 6/2010. Expiration on it says 6/2011. It actually went rancid by 4/2011. Cocoa butters is very stable and will keep for about five years and resist going rancid. They were probably selling old butters for super high prices.

Prices:
Yup I agree with the other review: They increased their prices too much for fragrances. One good thing though is that their shipping is free.

Overall, purchase at your own expense. They take no responsibility over anything.",1

The pie is on top of a generous pile of mashed potatoes and gravy. Best pie I've ever had. My boyfriend ate a good portion of my plate and loved it, and he hates mushrooms.

The included car wash, discounted, is always lack luster and is why when I just want a wash I choose another company. Perhaps, it is time to have a review of how to effectively wipe and dry off automobiles. Seems like all the Yelps ding the car wash. Maybe instead of a ""driver"" decal on the employees uniform, a more appropriate decal might read everyone's retrained and you will not believe our attention to the details. Rag dust okay but floor mats transposed and still lint on the dash and door jams wiped but never expertly cleaned or wiped down.

5789697,"I tend to avoid the big flashy restaurants... especially in the ones in the downtown core. Part of me is always leery. When your main clientele is tourists and the business crowd - simply by location alone - there is a good chance that the food is not necessarily up to par with the cost associated to the meal. Now, I am always willing to be proven wrong so when I had a chance to try Bier Markt for the first time recently, I went in with an open mind.

For the uninformed, Bier Markt is a Toronto chain of restaurants that came to Montreal and took over the old Queue de Cheval location in front of the Bell Centre. Bier Markt's claim to fame is the ridiculous amount of beers they have available - over 150 beers from 30 different countries. The selection is extremely varied and quite good. The beer menu is nicely elaborate. It does a great job of categorizing and describing each beer to help with selection. The prices vary widely though which is a bit strange. I also appreciated that the food menu provides recommendations with pairing for each dish. For a restaurant like this, that detail is essential and provides a nice way to try new beers.

Foodwise, the menu is a mixture of beer garden and classic bar/pub fare. My friends and I went for three starters initially. First up was the French onion soup au gratin with caramelized onions, house veal stock, toasted bread and Gruy√®re cheese. Personally I did not try it but the response from my friends was good - not great.

Next was the baked Brie with Granny Smith apples, lingonberry jam, roasted pecans, pickles and baguette crisps. The jam was nice but once again, overall the dish was good, not great. The portion size was only not that great considering its cost either.

The final entree was the baked crab dip - wild Canadian rock crab, white cheddar, cream cheese, Old Bay spices and toasted house flatbread. This was a more interesting and well done dish. Very creamy with nice pieces of meaty crab within. Main issue once again though was the size relative to the price. Very limited amount of flatbread and frankly, this appetizer was barely sufficient for me much less as a dish to share - which at its price point, it needs to be.

Prior to the description of the mains, I will just take a moment to discuss the service. Now, for the most part, I am pretty relaxed about service in general - I simply want timely, friendly with a good handle of the menu. However, there are a few things that are BIG no-nos for me. One of them is very simple - you should never serve the next course without clearing the table first. During our meal, not only was that done but that was after all the empty dishes were left in front of us for about 20 minutes before serving. On top of that, the waitresses serving our table had no clue who had which main so the second course became a awkward and complicated dance of simultaneously removing, moving temporary around and serving dishes. And then, the same thing was repeated at dessert time later on! With the number of waitresses working around us, these were big red flags about the quality of service.

Back to the food now. The first main was the Merchant burger - 10 oz. Wagyu beef burger, smoked bacon, charred red onion, vine-ripe tomato, iceberg lettuce, ""Bier 58"" sauce, toasted bun with house frites. A good sized burger - a little overcooked for my liking but still flavourful. A solid burger but again for its price, more was hoped for.

I personally went with the Chicken ABT - fresh chargrilled chicken breast, avocado, crisp smoked bacon, vine-ripe tomato, shaved iceberg lettuce and honey Dijon aioli in a Portuguese roll served with fries. The sandwich was good but somehow left me underwhelmed and wishing I had ordering something else. Some extra aioli and avocado may have helped to provide more kick but otherwise I felt the sandwich lacked pop. The fries were nice and crisp at least - very classic bistro style.

The final main was the smoked pork back ribs which are spice-rubbed and smoked for 6 hours, served with a golden BBQ sauce, fries and a red cabbage & caraway slaw. The ribs were nice and tender but because the sauce needed to be added by the client, they were a little dry. The BBQ sauce was a necessity to add, not a choice.

The final dish we ordered was the waffle ice cream sandwich - house-baked chocolate waffles served warm with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. Best thing we had all night - creative, chocolatey and rich. Always nice to end a meal on a positive.

In the end, Bier Markt left me cold. The beer selection was nice and varied - definitely the draw to coming back. However, the food was uninspiring and simply okay. The service was poor. Okay food can be acceptable at certain times but not when my personal bill was 80$ without tip. At that price, there are a heck of a lot better options I can enjoy. Bier Markt is a great happy hour spot for excellent beer but not a worthwhile dining option.

Cheers!",2
1117316,"Damn this place is cute!!!!! Absolutely adorable branding and display. Treats behind the glass looked so tasty. 

I was walking around the area looking for coffee and am usually super weary of ""hipster"" coffee joints that charge exorbitant prices for terrible coffee and a pissy attitude. 
However I saw the menu on the window and the breakfast croissant meal really caught my eye. The prices looked very reasonable for a variety of brunch goodies. 

I went inside and proceeded to wait...and wait...and wait...luckily I wasn't in a hurry but come on! There were only 3 people ahead of me and no joke I waited over 20 minutes. 

There was only one guy doing everything! He was kind, professional, and didn't seem frazzled but how is one person supposed to take orders, make change, make the drinks, prepare the food, and serve tables? I hope they were just shortstaffed that day. 

Anyway, I FINALLY ordered and the employee put my sandwich on the grill. It was premade which was kind of disappointing but at least it was cheap and big. Coffee was meh. Not the worst. Not good. My cup was very cute though! Oh when I went to pay the guy kinda looked up at me strangely from behind their ""square"" system thing and told me he would have to go downstairs for cash...what?! Who doesn't have cash?! I know I'm a millennial but come on! 
So yes, I waited again. Finally got my coffee and croissant. Way too much room in the coffee but oh well, I couldn't wait around again to ask for more. Croissant was large and I was starving. It was very very greasy but I like that. Give me all the butter please. Overall, I would go back because the food was cheap and while they were understaffed the employee was really nice and didn't act all frazzled and stressed or rude and annoyed. Just don't go if you have limited timing and can't spend 30minutes or more. 

Oh! one thing was weird! a pastry chef girl would occasionally emerge from the back and drop things off. She made NO facial expressions and didn't even clock the large group of people waiting. Maybe it's not her job to help but it seemed super weird not to even comment on the situation or acknowledge her co-worker. Maybe she was a robot.",3

I also can't say enough about the 'Pimientos Rellenos de buey' (Piquillo peppers stuffed with braised oxtail and Manchego cheese) - rich, decadent, delicious and perfectly paired with the wine we were drinking. The wine was from the Ribera Del Duero region, called 'Avaniel' - highly recommended.

We also had their Fideo pasta special - with  shrimp, summer vegetables, soffrito 'sauce' and aioli. It was delicious - except that the shrimp were a tad overcooked (sorry Chef!). They could have stood to be cooked about a minute or two less than they were (or maybe it was a heat lamp issue).

It's easy to pick on a tiny flaw because the overall experience was just so great. I would definitely go back, and often.",5

I had to request to switch in the middle of her doing my threading and she was absolutely rude the entire time. She had a bad attitude before and after my visit and since my bad experience with her I've noticed she always seems to be rude to guests. I hope she finds another job because she's clearly miserable doing threading.,2

My entree was the smart chicken and hubs had the pork tenderloin. Both  were unbelievably good and our server was wonderful.

215966,"Call it Crappy Taco. That pretty much sums up the experience you are going to get. 

Unlike others, I actually thought the tacos were pretty good. But on this busy Sunday, everything else was unpleasant. Other than the view, there is absolutely no reason to visit this place, unless you have a fetish for outdoor Jenga and lousy service. And you can find views just as good as this in Cleveland where your experience will actually be pleasurable.

This was our second time visiting here, and both times were unpleasant. On this visit:

1. The outdoor hostess greeted us with contempt. She may as well have said, ""Oh. You."" when she took our name. A smile and a hello seemed a foreign concept to her.

2. Since there was a wait, we sat at the bar. We may as well have been ghosts. The bartender looked past us three times while he waited on other patrons who it seemed were his old pals from high school. Finally, another bartender came and helped. Good, right? Wrong...

3.  I got the house margarita, and I think it may have been the only time in my life that I sent a drink back. It was like drinking salted lime water. I had both my wife and friend taste it to make sure I wasn't crazy, but they concurred: It was nothing short of awful. 

4.  Our server was kind, but she seemed to really be struggling. I am not sure if this was her fault or the inept and unfriendly bar, but it took us over 20 minutes to get our drinks. In fact, our appetizers came out before our drinks! And when the apps did arrive, we were missing our guacamole. In fact, our main entrees arrived before our guacamole...which arrived before we had more chips with which to eat them. And so on...

Nothing is all bad. The tacos were actually pretty tasty. Paying our bill was quick. But I found the whole experience condescending. What I mean by that is that Coastal Taco seems to exist on the premise that, because of their prime riverfront location, the employees don't have to do anything other than show up and act surly, as if we should be thrilled that we graced them with our presence. No, that is not the way it is supposed to work.

Given the embarrassment of riches when it comes to Cleveland's dining scene, we deserve and should expect better.",1

5810723,"I came here for a cut and colour. The front desk woman was super friendly/attentive. Also, she has awesome hair. 

Stephanie was my stylist and she was great. She answered all of my questions and was very pleasant. Unlike another reviewer, I actually liked that we didn't talk the entire time. It's nice to zone out and play on your phone while someone is working away on your hair. 

I took off one star for two reasons.

1) During the hairwashing process, I was presented with which colours I wanted (from a big book). It was super uncomfortable to raise my head halfway during this, while someone else was washing my hair. I actually had a sore neck the next day from straining it. 

2) The chair where you get your hair washed and the chair where you sit while your hair is being coloured are not comfortable. Defs recommend they invest in some cushions or longer chairs so your legs can stretch out more. 

I will definitely be coming back because my hair looks amazing and this place was awesome. That being said, a few things still could be improved upon.",4
191620,"I have a 2003 Mustang GT with some issues but none that were a show stopper until yesterday. :^0

The diagnostics were kinda pricy BUT the cost is applied towards your repair if you decide to go forward with any repairs.

I dropped off my vehicle late Friday about 4:30 and was promised a visual inspection and call back if diagnostics were needed: that did not happen, which concerned me. :^\

When I came in Saturday morning, my car was in the bay being looked at. I had only signed and authorized for a visual inspection but they had done some electrical diagnostics which I don't think they would have charged me for. :^)

I don't know everything about car repair but I can tell most of the time if I am being B.S.ed. 

They recommended about four repairs to fix one problem.

One repair they recommended I know was needed but I feel weren't necessary. In other words, I have been driving with this condition for some time (three years) and was told by another shop that the repair could be put off for a while but the condition should be repaired soon (that was just two months ago). 

Don't get me wrong: it is not like Meineke was doing wrong or even acting in bad faith: it was one shops opinion versus another's (along with my my previous research into the issue) that made me feel that the one repair could be put off for a while.   

It's hard to believe that the issue had contributed to my cars driveability  but I needed to get it done sooner or later so I opted to get it done that day because the cost was VERY FAIR AND REASONABLE AND I BELIEVED THE SHOP WAS ACTING IN GOOD FAITH.

They did recommend a spark plug change (as that could have contributed to my issue) but if they had actually checked the plugs, they would have seen that they were fine and recently changed.

I just got the car back and did not check the invoice yet but I will update this review in a few weeks and give more feed back as the car's OBD calibrates.

1/1/16 Update:

No problems with the repair and satisfied with the service: I have not had any more issues with my car so I have not been back which is VERY GOOD!

I would recommend this place to a friend for sure!",5
2790434,"I love the Arcadia location of Kneaders, I love Kneaders in general. 

To me this place is an elevated Panera, with a great bakery and really good food. My favorite items are the sourdough pancakes, the broccoli and cheese soup and the BLT with avocado. The pancakes are seriously some of the best pancakes I have ever had, the sourdough taste is subtle but it really brings them over the top.

Now I am not easily bothered, but what I saw occur last night did not sit right with me, especially being in management of a restaurant chain myself. We wanted to order some food, but we were told the kitchen was closed...no big deal. A group sat next to us about 20-30 mins after we noticed them ordering food(with a different server). We brushed it off thinking maybe they were going to be told the same thing. Then all of a sudden food is being delivered to them after we had been told otherwise. It was just incredibly rude and a huge slap in the face. I had asked our server what was going on and she told me that they ""bribed"" the kitchen and paid them to cook their food. What?!

I have fairly high expectations for Chicken and Waffles having eaten at some of America's finest like Roscoe's and Gussie's, so I came in here expecting a lot.

I want to start off by saying the place looked dope!  I felt like I was in a store selling high end kicks or a hip hop clothing store in NYC.  I was really feeling the way the kitchen looked along with the seating area.  Man, even the little hooks to hang your bag on the tables made my girl get all giddy and excited.

The prices are very reasonable and the menu is pretty extensive.  I would prefer more options for Chicken and Waffles though, as those seemed limited for some reason.  Like what if I wanted 1 piece bone in and half a waffle cuz I just drank a 40oz and feel a bit bloated knowmsayin?

Overall the service was aight and it did take a mighty minute to get my meal (waited about 15-20 mins for my triple bone in and waffle).  The taste though was on point, my chicken was as crispy as your toes hitting the sand on a hot summers day.  The syrup they have on the table, is some high end business too.  Dat waffle tho, could use a bit more crunch too it.  As soon as I hit it with some Maple Sizzurp, that thing got mad soggy 0-100 real quick.  All good, I ate it up anyway!",4

I ordered two meat plate of katsu and beef and then a plate of shrimp and thats it! One other dad and dtr left so upset because it took so long for their food to be served. I asked how much longer for my food the first time and she asked ""what'd your order again"" so I told her. No update. I asked 10 min later and she said ""what'd you order again"" seriously?!? I repeated my order and she said Oh here it is it just came out. It was my Katsu and beef and she said that's it. I said NO I'm still waiting for my shrimp. The cooks in back looked like they had no idea about it. And told me they were just waiting for my katsu to be done. I showed them the plate like It's right here..... .... suddenly they had a plate of shrimp there for who knows how long sitting there and said ""oh are you table 6??"" Like YES I am actually. What the hell is happening there?!? No idea what they're doing or how to respond to customers.


Only pro is that the food is still good. Too bad they don't even have it in stock ...

At an average price of $10 for lunch, I think this is a great value compared to a lot of other restaurants in the neighborhood. After dining here several times I finally decided to try a mini caramel macaron. They forgot to bring it out with my meal, so to make up for it they brought me an extra vanilla one complimentary.

I let her know that we would literally be throwing our money away if we exchanged the shoes for a pair he didnt even want and she said shes sorry but we need to think of this from the COMPANY'S point of view: ""We cant just let anyone come in 4 months later off the street to return shoes because we dont know what happened to them."" 
I was like, wait, what??? First of all, we're not from the street. We're customers who have a legit receipt and the COMPANY doesnt have any shoes he wants in his size. The shoes Im returning are WHITE all around so you can see theyre in perfect condition. 
She kept repeating the same thing and i was so fed up I called the corporate office. They apologized for her because obviously policies are just guidelines and even though she had the power to give us store credit, she didnt, and thus will require more training on what the COMPANY actually requires of her. 

We're so done with this store. We went to the Foot Locker at AZ Mills and told them what happened and the manager there gave us store credit and said this isnt the first time its happened. Emma has pissed off a lot of people so I hope she gets it together and learns how to appreciate money-spending customers.",1

Today I had ombr√© brows done by Yona.
What a wonderful experience.  My brows look absolutely gorgeous.  

Yona is a true perfectionist.  I look forward to my next pampering st Pucci Salon.",5
4854988,"This place has the full package! The best pizza in Vegas (Roccos is up there too)  and service! When it comes to pizza, I stick with the basics cheese or pepperoni (the way it was intended).  We come here many times and will continue.",5
3740640,"Fantastic pizza. Fresh ingredients, well baked. The crust was light and crispy. And just as delicious heated up the morning after!",4
981241,Sit at the bar here. Great fish tank. Best cocktail waitresses downtown. Biggest shrimp I've ever seen in shrimp cocktail.,5
4394443,"Almost always have an issue getting prescriptions here. They've lost, misplaced and forgotten a number of times over the years. 
To be honest, I didn't realize how bad they were until I went to the one near Lincoln and Scottsdale Road. Those guys were polite, fast and on point. 
The location could be cleaner and Staff at this location can be a bit creepy too. I'd say management needs an overhaul.",2
2125241,"Great spot! I had the chorizo, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich and it was very fresh and tasty. Everyone very nice and courteous. Definitely will return",5
43000,"Top of the line food and beer. Wish they could have a bigger building, but that would mean moving and I like how I can walk here! Don't let the wait scare you- it's well worth it. 

You have to try any of saisons and of course the duck fat fries... YUM!",5
3587684,Doesn't get any better than a personalized pizza and a drink for about $11.  Blaze has become my go to when I am returning from Mount Charleston or if my dogs are getting groomed in the same parking lot.  I generally stick with a basic pepperoni and change up the toppings.  I've dined in and gotten it to go.  The staff is friendly and if there is a line it moves fairly quickly.  Only once have I been unhappy with a carry out pizza as it was a little undercooked to my liking but that was easily remedied by putting it in my oven for a few minutes.,5
920036,"AMAZING food. Best Mexican we have had so far in Vegas. In fact we went two days in a row. I judge Mexican food by three things - Margaritas, Sopa De Tortilla and Guacamole. All three were beyond my expectations here. So so good. We were also there for my daughters birthday the other day and she was treated really well and loved the ice cream treat and that everyone sang to her. We will be back lots!!",5
5493586,"I really liked it.  Great new sub joint right in the Point Park/Art Institute zone.  For me, perfect place to grab a bite before an evening class.

Prices are really cheap.  If you go at lunchtime you can get a combo with a ""freshman"" sub, side (chips, macaroni salad or pickle spears) and a soda for $5.50!!! OMG, that's super cheap to me.  And the freshman is really quite large and stuffed with meat.  I don't think I could have eaten any larger of a size.

I tried the steak and cheese (no cheese, no onions -- the onions are raw, not cooked, so: No. Thank. You. to them.)  The sub was great.  Hot, fresh, tasty -- and that was just the guy behind the counter! (rim shot!) No seriously it was very good and just what I was in the mood for.  Of course if I had been normal and gotten the cheese it would have been even better and stayed together.  But I don't like cheese all the time and it don't like me! (lactose intolerant)

The macaroni salad did waylay me with an unexpected bite of fresh, raw onion -- bleh!  Almost ruined my taste buds for my sub.  Personally I would steer clear of it in the future, even though it was very fresh and otherwise tasty.

Other than that, great cheap meal on a cold night.  The dining room is pleasant and a lot more clean and comfortable than a lot of sub joints I have seen around.

Looking forward to trying the egg salad, which is made daily.  Hopefully without onions!",5
1975367,"This restaurant replaces the previous cheesesteak establishment, Big Al's. I actually went there wanting to eat a simple cheesesteak: steak, cheese, sauteed onions, and perhaps a light seasoning or sauce to coat it. Imagine my surprise when there were no simple cheesesteaks available -- every single steak sandwich on the menu included the kitchen sink. I don't want lettuce and tomatoes on my steak sandwich; give me a real, philly-style cheesesteak!

Turned off by the menu trying too hard to be fancy, I ordered their sloppy fries, which was a mix of cheese curds, mushrooms, peppers, and spicy mayo. It was way too salty, which made me shudder at the thought of trying their poutine.

Big Al's was definitely the better establishment and I'm sorry to see it go. Top Gun Steak doesn't give any options to double the meat or add additional toppings -- you are forced to order whatever crazy setups they have on their menu.",2
4678006,Thank you Oliver for all your help!!! I had a great experience was on time and attentive. Made the experience easy and will definitely refer!!! Thanks again!!!,5
2009548,"Don't let the ghetto shopping center steer you away...it's a great place.  Definitely a no frills type place...this is the real deal.  It was very evident by most of the patrons actually being Vietnamese, you know it must be good.

You just walk in and sit anywhere that's open and someone will bring you their menu which is quite extensive.  I had my favorite, which is Pho Tai.  The broth was perfect, and had a pretty complex flavor profile.  Hard to explain, but some pho broth's are very 1-dimensional...this one was exceptionally flavorful.  They don't skimp on the meat either, which some places tend to do.  I've been to Vietnamese restaurants all over the valley, and although I have still never been to Da Vang...I'd venture to say this might be the best pho in Phoenix.  Tastes darn close to the stuff you get in CA, in Garden Grove/Westminster/Little Saigon.

Also, it is dirt cheap! $4.50 for a big delicious bowl of pho tai....yum.  I'll be back soon for sure.",5
2810631,"Great Food! Chicken is amazing, so are the pork ribs! Sides were different from the norm. I chose the broccoli salad which was delicious. Also got the macaroni and cheese and it was definitely better than a lot of chain restaurant's mac n cheese.",4
194854,"Read this before you go:
Hint #1:This is meant to be a family-style restaurant, meaning that you get little plates and everyone takes some of each entree on their little plate.
Hint #2: This is a Korean restaurant, meaning the food is Korean spicy. If you don't like spicy, do not get the tteokkboki or the spicy chicken. If things are really spicy for you, you can cool off your mouth with rice, pickled radish or iced tea.
Hint #3: If you get the bibimbap, PLEASE, mix it all together and add gochujang sauce to your desired spicy level. You can always add more sauce on your own plate.

We had a great experience - we were seated quickly, we got our food fairly quickly, everything was hot (temp wise) and our drinks were refilled before we asked. We did go after 3 on a Sunday, though. And the food, the food was SO GOOD! 

The only downside was that the food did not come out all at once but if you share it family style, you just start with what comes out first.

I wish BonChon luck because we would like to be regulars.",5
623889,"I arrived at Charlotte 15 minutes before my plane was supposed to leave. I had to transfer from terminal B to terminal E. When I asked for them to hold my flight, the gate agent said that they know we're coming and not to worry. We ran to the gate and there was no one there and no plane. When they came back they said that 15 minutes ago they gave our seats to standby passengers and that the PLANE LEFT 15 MINUTES EARLY! They told us that it is a transfer airport so they usually leave early. BS!  They told us that they only hold the plane if there at least 10 people missing. Luckily there was 1 more flight that night. Suck it U.S Airways",1

5036833,"This weekend I wanted to get my dog bathed, nail trimmed, etc. I called a couple places and they were all booked. I called Pawsh Wash and they said they could take her if we could come in then. So I brought my dog in. While I was filling out the paper with my contact info. the groomer came to the other side of the counter and loved on my dog to gain her trust and then took her on the other side of the counter and let her off the leash. She said it would be 2 to 3 hours and that they close by 4. We left and ran some errands. As we were headed home we noticed it was close to 3:30 and so I called to check on her as it had been 3 hours. I was told she would be ready in 20 minutes. We were about 20 minutes away so we headed that direction. We arrived exactly 20 minutes later. I walked in, and this is the only reason they got 3 stars instead of four, the groomer told me I was rushing her and that they usually call when she would be done. I explained that I had called because she told me they closed at 4 and wanted to make sure I picked her up before then. She said okay and that was that. My dog is a lab so she does not get groomed, but the bath and nail trim etc. were very good. I would probably try this place again, because they did a good job. I just hope I don't have to deal with being told I am rushing them again when I called, and they told me to come get her in 20 minutes which I did.",3
1301374,Where to start with this place.. so freakin good! We had the  fried Chicken meal along with the Brussel sprouts and fried green tomato appetizer. We were impressed with everything. The chicken was perfectly cooked as well as the Brussel sprouts. I'm not a watermelon eater but my husband said it was delicious! The atmosphere is cool and it feels like your hanging out at a friends for dinner. Must experience.,5
2683163,"In a city that has an abundance of Mexican restaurants, this is one of the gems that I have discovered.  Mexican is one of my favorite types of food, so to continue to frequent one place really says something.  The menu is typical of a taco shop, with tacos, burritos, quesadillas, nachos, fries, and others.  I especially enjoy the torta.  They have a great selection of meats for any of their menu items.  Everything is made to order, so during a busy time, it can be a bit slow, but it is well worth the wait!",5

Ample parking.",5
4531097,"For an 8pm reservation on a Saturday night, I didn't have a problem getting in.

When we got to the restaurant, it was relatively empty.

When we left, there were many more people.

The website is kinda deceiving.  They show the nice lounge area (which is NOT where they seat you for dinner).  The lounge area was nice, but it wasn't open at all when I was there. (and I left at 10pm)

The food was pretty good.  I couldn't believe that the entrees didn't come with Naan or anything.  Everything (Dal, Naan, etc.) had to be ordered a la carte (for an extra charge).  We ordered the Naan and Roti which only came with four pieces each. 

Maybe I'm just used to going to places where the Naan is free and you get it by the basket-load.

I would definitely go back again if I wanted Indian food while in Vegas.

The service was excellent too.  Very attentive and quick.",4
102230,"A family owned restaurant in the heart of Gilbert which gives back to the community through fundraisers and friendly service...  When you get to know the employees they become like family, two of the very best are Mike and Ben! 

The food... Fantastic!  A great menu and really interesting specials.  Primarily this is a sandwich/pizza with in house freshly baked bread and wheat wraps however they take it a step further with bruschetta, mushroom Phylos and other good stuff!",5
2866942,I can only speak for the food - not the sushi-  the shogun chicken with noodles and the shogun salad are the signature dishes and I LOVE THEM!  Consistently yummy for years. - nothing like it anywhere else.  Don't let the sushi haters scare you away from the regular menu - everything I've had has been great!  Ps never had a problem with service either.,5
2594313,"I love Your Helping Hands! I enjoyed their services so much, I wrote an article about them and put them on my website as a ""Top Pick"" of Las Vegas. Here it is below--

This is our top pick for house cleaning services in Las Vegas. They are thorough, dependable, and have successfully served the Las Vegas Valley since 1991. Even more, they use only safe and green products.

I've lived here two years and tried six different businesses. I've also heard plenty of horror stories from longtime residents. Don't be fooled by dirt cheap cleaning services; you get what you pay for. Some places rush over things, some places break things, some places take things. Some use strong-smelling, toxic chemicals that leave your place smelling like a grim hospital ward. Other places go through employees like air traffic controllers.  Once I was informed by a cleaning office that two experienced women would be arriving at 2pm sharp. At 2:25pm two guys approximately 18 and 19 roll up in a raggedy gangster car with no hubcaps and cracked rear window. They walk in, pants pulled down showing their boxers, carrying a cheap old vacuum with dangling cord. I say ""Sorry guys, not happening.""

Then one day I notice a shiny, practical, white hatchback parked across the street loaded with a variety of cleaning supplies. The car windows display a house cleaning advertisement/logo. Soon three industrious-looking women come bustling out my neighbor's apartment door, carrying vacuums and mops. I ask them for a flyer which they hand me with a smile.

Next week they clean my 2 bedroom apartment. Before they arrive, Cindy, a co-owner and manager, gives me a courteousy call to check in. The three-women crew does an amazing job. Everything is swept, cleaned, scrubbed, scoured, washed, emptied, dusted, polished, picked up, put away, folded, and now shiny. And get this:  it smells fine, too, light and clear, no crazy chemicals. They use only safe and green products. A few minutes after the girls leave, Cindy calls again, making sure all went well.

I was so impressed I used them again. They did another stellar job.

So I decided Las Vegas Top Picks should have a top pick for housecleaning, too. I asked to meet the owners, Cindy and Bobby. One spring afternoon I visited their office; we sipped peppermint tea and talked house cleaning.

They told me some funny stories of celebrity clients. One individual had a large cougar in his garage, which often sat atop a 100K+ luxury car scratching the bejesus out of it. Since they've been in business for nearly 22 years, they have many such stories! Such a length of time also exemplifies their success and trustworthiness. Bobby, the owner, takes pride in her work and good care of her ""girls"". Their website, which I hope you visit, further demonstrates this. It is comprehensive, professional, personal, and with a big clean heart. They work hard to tailor their cleaning to your precise specifications. In my experience, businesses that truly care about what they do provide the best service.

Also awesome was their giant city map pinned to an office wall. Was I in a secret CIA hub scouting the streets of Las Vegas? Or perhaps they just have tons of customers and know this town like the back of their helping hands.

They even have a mascot - a cute friendly little dog named Bella.  

I believe it's important to find skilled trustworthy businesses whenever spending money, doubly important when they come into your home on an ongoing basis. For house cleaning Your Helping Hands is TOP in this town!

2459802,"Typically I like this location/chain just because it is a welcome break from your usual fast food burger. The prices are a little steep but the food is decent and the service is good.
Yesterday I ordered a turkey sandwich on white with no tomatoes. Luckily it is just an aversion to tomatoes and not an allergy because there were clearly tomatoes on it at some point based on all the seeds left behind. It seems like they forgot what they were dong and pulled them off. It could have been a ready made sandwich and they just pulled them off to accommodate my order but I don't think so.
Despite this...I will still go back.",3
2750720,"Serive is always great and the food is amazing! 
Been coming to the central location for years. 
I will say with any good restaurant comes good clientele and sometimes there could be a wait... let me tell you it is well worth the wait!!!
They always take care of you while you're waiting, you still have chips, you still have salsa and you still have your drink while your waiting (remember people the wait staff does not control the kitchen...  sometimes things just happen, so be nice to your servers!) 
Love this place and I will  continue to be a loyal customer!
Shout out and a thank you to all the staff!",5
4096708,"After reading the reviews here, I took my cat in today (who hadn't peed in 2 days). I was fearing the worst about kidney disease. 

WHAT a good experience. I was quite nervous about the cat, and the girl at the front was not only knowledgeable, but kind and honest as well.   I don't feel like I was scalped financially, and I feel good about the outcome for the cat (antibiotics and UT treats should do the trick). 

Highly recommend. And I'm picky.",5
637994,"First I went here as part of my company's dime.  Comedy Club is nice big acts in the heart of downtown.  East 4th is one of the cooler streets in the midwest.  The bar downstairs serves martinis has a nicely decorated bar but cost a lot.  Upstairs at the restaurant we had a big group so we only had three items to choose from...but the chicken was pretty much a full bbq chicken that was good with garlic mashed potatoes.  If you saw the pork chops you might never eat again.  Not sure of the prices bc I didn't pay but it was good.  This is the only place on 4th without a patio, but I like the mix of the bar and comedy club downstairs and the restaurant upstairs.",4
5465873,"Went here for lunch.  Very mediocre in every respect.  The food bar does not keep the food hot, and at 12:30 in the afternoon, the food should have been hot and fresh.  It was neither.  The Hot Pot bar that they advertise was not open.  That may have been a plus, we will never find out.  There are many more Chinese places in the area.",2
