393646,Got the breakfast sandwich with home fries both of which were great. Only reason I didn't give 4 stars is slow service as the place was busy and the ice coffee was just ok slightly watery,3

I booked a large group here for my Wedding Rehearsal dinner. I wanted something that had a private-ish area for our group, but had character and good food!

We ended up booking an area downstairs with tall bar tables and stools. There were also other private dining rooms you can book out as well. When I was planning this, it was super easy. They have a $30 per person set menu that comes with an antipasto plate with appetizers and cured meats and cheeses. Then I could choose from their menu any pizza I wanted which they will determine the number that are made and come out based on 3-4 slices a person. 
It also includes dessert which they also determined on the day, but there was TONS of food and LOTS of leftovers. 
I could also pre-order wine which was a great suggestion as then with the group people could just state ""white"" or ""red"" and it was ready to go. You only pay for what you drink. 

The servers were friendly, and was really good at adjusting the price based on the number of people that did not show up. 
I loved that the resto was able to overall just make you pay for what you eat without over charging. 

I've never been to Libretto before, but love that they have unique pizza choices, all that were very good. My favourite was the Spicy Sausage pizza. (as opposed to the house made sausage). The Duck Confit was good too but didn't have enough taste for me. 
For apps, they gave us a bunch of food, but the most memorable was the Gnocchi and we couldn't stop eating it. 
For dessert, we got the infamous tiramisu which was amazing.

There is also an option for Spelt Crust!",5
5084035,AMAZING!! I got a reasonable quote and they came the next day.   Not only did they pick up my junk but they swept up any debris around the area.   Very professional and friendly.   Will use them again for sure.,5

I'm not a tea expert. I don't own a diffuser. I prefer my tea iced and plain because, frankly, I'm sweet enough. 

In search of the ever elusive 'thoughtful' Christmas gift for my picky sister I stopped in at Fleur de Teas in the hopes of finding something special. I wasn't disappointed. 

The shop, located next to the Phoenix City Grille, is small and cozy. Don't let the size fool you, this small spot is bursting at the seams with a huge variety of tea, tea accessories and beauty products. 

The staff was friendly and very helpful, walking me through several different varieties of tea until I found exactly what I was looking for. Needless to say, the gift was a hit (and very reasonably priced). 

I'm not a tea expert, but Fleur de Teas makes me want to be. I'll be back!",4
173185,I have been going here for years and expect a student massage. Last week I went because I was in so much back pain. I got lucky and had Willie Reese as my student therapist. He hit so many tiger points I was pain free all week. I returned this week for 2 hours with Willie and OMG.....painfully but very rewarding. I have never been treated better. I am out of pain!!!!!,5
2493564,"First off let me start with 50 stars for Savino. Here's my story: so I had an account with cox for 8 years. During this time it was a constant bill goes up every year and you have to call and fight your way down to where you were before. I got to the point where their ""loyalty dept"" could no longer work with me as I was an ""existing client"". I was told they could no longer offer me promotions. After 8 years really?? So I cancelled my service. After a month of homework on other company's I found out they have a monopoly in Las Vegas and pretty much are the only good internet company here. Basically we are in their hands.
I spoke to an IT friend and he recommended me buying my own modem and router, then going to just connect service. I went in and explained my situation. Savino was very nice and understanding of the hell I just went through with their company. Not only did he manage to reconnect my service, but gave me a way better deal then their stupid ""loyalty dept"". Please save yourself the headache of calling and come in to speak to these guys. They seem to have more brain and customer service than their whole ""loyalty dept"" put together. Great job team!!",3
3846675,"Just returned from a fabulous anniversary trip to Las Vegas. We booked a fountain view room at the Bellagio and we were not disappointed, the lady at check in asked if we had a preference for floor and we told her to give us the best in her opinion, so we were placed on the 28th floor. The elevators are a thrill ride, LOL ZOOOOM! We walked in the room and WOW! The Eiffel tower at the Paris and the entire fountain area like a postcard!
 Best room I have every had in Vegas. Comfy bed and pillows, very clean and fully stocked (but pricey) mini bar. LOL, But vending and ice was just up the hall. 
Casino was fun. better class of folks for the most part, but still a party atmosphere. Actually didnt do too bad and came home with winnings! 
WE do tip well, so we had some really good bell & valet service. Really not sure why anyone would complain, unless nothing pleases them. It was one of the best experiences I have had traveling, and the place is JUST GORGEOUS!! The flowers alone are worth the visit! 
The resort is not for folks who want to get stupid and loud, head to hard Rock if thats your thing. It does have that high end elegance that many casinos and hotels are missing in town.
Also if you LOVE high end shopping ( even if its just the window variety) you can spend a day inside and around the resort. its located in a fun spot on the strip. The money they didnt get at slots I spent at Giardini for beautiful Italian ceramics! Better than a cheap T-shirt, LOL.
Then there is Jean Phillipes Patisserie, with the giant chocolate fountain. Not just decadent sweets, but great Panini and crepes for lunch, and we made it our go to for coffee and Brioche for breakfast. Grab something and go sit by the pool with the paper ( Only for guests) .
Awesome dinner on your checklist? We chose Le Cirque at the Bellagio.  If French food is your thing,and you like to dress to impress, its one of the best. The service was amazing, the decor & the plates were wonderful and the food Gourmet. They helped me arrange a surprise for our anniversary and presented the table with a Beautiful cake from Jean Phillipes in our anniversary colors! 5 star+ to their whole team!!
I cant wait to return again!!!",5

The lean beef Pho was tasty and hearty, with a light broth.  The dish came with a fried spring roll and a nice side salad (with traditional dressing) that was tangy and bright.  We also shared a crab Rangoon appetizer.  They were small and served with the same dipping sauce (sweet chili) as the spring rolls.

Pleasant and attentive servers, along with a steaming bowl of soup made for a very comforting meal.",4

2293919,"I am big on Food Safety and when I see food safety violations (especially when someone else is cooking my food), I feel propelled to say something. I stopped by here and placed my order. The female taking my order called another employee over who was on the line cooking the food to help her with a cash register issue. The employee stop making the food, walked over and started handling the money and pressing buttons on the cash register. I ordered through the drive through so I can see how nasty the monitor was on the cash register. 

The female that finished handling the cash register issues went back to make the food without exchanging gloves. I said something immediately and to my surprise the original cashier clerk defended her action as if she was scared to correct her. This happens in the workplace a lot. People see others violating rules and dont say anything to ""keep the peace"". 
I was sooo mad, I told the cashier ""Forget it"" I dont want this food and drove off not even negotiating my refund. 

I have eaten here many of time and had great experiences. I just had to post this so the whomever is in charge can round up the employees and remind them about Food Safety and not be to lazy to wash their hands or change gloves when touching other things away from the food prepping line.

4583209,"Not sure why there are so many negative reviews here. Let me point out a few things that matter when you enter a brand store like Canada Goose.
1. The material and the offerings this brand has for Winter wear is of no match to any other brand and hence the price does all the justice. It comes with a 10 year warranty, what else would you need.
2. Such stores are always jam packed and its very difficult for any sales associate to handle multiple at the same time. Yes, even if you deploy a soldier of sales men, its not enough for such a store
3. What they offer is promising and  they do no compromise on quality or safety when it comes to winter wear.
4. The sales associate 'Luna' was super sweet to us. Though it was the peek of season and super busy, she was kind enough to answer every question and took time to explain every detail of the varieties they had at the store.
I do not need to recommend this brand to anyone. Those who own this know the worth of it. It is indeed a life time investment worth every penny.",5
3560831,"**Check out Dollar Mountain!** (located in the back of the store) 

I happened upon this store while on a ""book quest"" during my stay in Phoenix in July 2013. I am a huge supporter of independently owned book stores, so I was really excited to find this gem. Though it's pretty small in comparison to some of the other indie shops I've been too, this book store has a pretty awesome selection of books. 

All the sections and shelves are well organized so books are easy to find. At the register, there is a glass showcase that holds some first editions, and even some autographed copies as well. 

The owner was very friendly, and extremely helpful. They were running some awesome specials as well. There are several tables at the front of the store where any of the books you find or select are only $2 each. I got several hardcover books (used) in EXCELLENT condition for $2 each. There are a few new books scattered throughout as well, but this store specializes in USED. IF you go to the back of the store, you'll find ""Dollar Mountain"", which is a HUGE stack of books that are all $1. Awesome deal!

So, when I was in this store, I asked the owner: ""What happens to the hundreds of books you get in that don't sell? Do you toss them? Recycle them?"" His reply: ""Some I do send off to be recycled into new paper for new books, but I primarily donate them to the troops overseas in Afghanistan and Iraq.""--That answer alone inspired me to make a hefty purchase. We need more stores and people like this to stay in business. These businesses are great for the community. 

I'd highly recommend this store should you ever be in the Phoenix area!",4
2359989,"This is one of my favorite restaurants.  I have been there numerous times since they've opened and the food has always been delicious and the service has been outstanding.  The bruschetta board, Tomasos meatballs, house made pasta and sauce are my go to items.  The cocktails are fabulous as well.  Most recently I sat outside at the bar with my friend and Nicole the bartender was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  I will be back for sure!",5
826059,"I discovered Las Vegas ATV Tours via Groupon and read some of the mixed (but mostly good) review via Trip Advisor and Yelp.  Overall, it seemed like everyone was super happy with their tour.

Communication is a little spotty at times, but mainly because it's a mom and pop kind of business and everyone works in that joint.  After a tour is when these guys respond to your emails and phone calls.  

We signed up for the One Hour Tour.  John picked us up from The Four Seasons Hotel along with other folks from different hotels on the strip and we headed towards the Motor Speedway where they dropped us off next to the Airforce base.  It's about a 30 mins drive. To begin with, I have never driven an ATV before, but I owned a scooter for seven years and have driven a motorcycle, so I am well aware of how to dress on a moving vehicle.  However, a few of the gals did not.  

Girls - be smart, not stupid.  Wear pants and choose the morning session in the summer.  It's simply too hot to do this tour in the middle of the afternoon.  You'll die.  Second, wear moisture wicking clothes as you will sweat and pour water all over your body.  Bring a light long sleeved shirt.  The sun is strong and no matter how much sunscreen you apply, you'll be thankful for the coverage when the wind picks up and sand is blowing onto your bare arms.  Second, wear old tennis shoes. Not TOMS, not Keds, not sandals.  Again, don't be an idiot, you are in the desert on a 4-wheeler.  The pedals have metal prongs and you need protection from the heat of the engine.

Last, bring a small backpack filled with water, extra sunscreen, ibuprofen, kleenex (i.e. toilet paper), chapstick and a bandana.  While the group gives you a water during the half time break, they only bring enough water for one bottle per person.  It's hot outside and the heat definitely got to me.  I wish I would have brought extra water and a bandana to cover my mouth from all the dirt.

Now, onto the tour.  I thought it was amazing.  The guys are tatted up, smoke and good ole' boys - they know what they are doing.  They did a great job describing what we would be doing and the hand signals to follow.  They also had extra riders to round up the caboose and let the girls ride tandem in the event they were too scared to drive an ATV.  They warm you up with an easy start filled with small bumps and hills.  As you become more comfortable with the ATV,  you  have the option to be more aggressive as you trust the machine over time.  They definitely make it clear to do whatever you feel most comfortable with and they never make you feel stupid for taking it slow and careful.  They know the area like the back of their dry, tan hands and do their job well.

Honestly, a one hour would have sufficed for me, as it's hot and physically exhausting, but we winded up riding two hours.  I'm not complaining, it was great fun, but for a retreat recreation I am planning in September, I would recommend to my older clients to perhaps consider just an hour as it is very physically demanding.  Also, your gas is in what looks like a gear shift on your right handle bar, it's a lot of strain to your right hand - it doesn't work like a motorcycle.  So be prepared for some terrible texting, post tour.

I winded up flying over a ""Witch's Eye"" and into a dune, causing me to almost flip over the handlebars.  I didn't, but winded up jamming my right thigh into the throttle and right handlebar.  It left a nasty bruise, cut and whiplash, but it was all worth it.  The staff was great - they made sure I was OK, gave me water and asked several times if I wanted to stop and go back.  I assured them I was OK, and while I definitely felt it the next day...and today...I am still so happy I did the tour.  It was great to get out into the desert, out of the strip, see the jets fly above you and meet some new people. I definitely would recommend this group and Casey as your guide.  To make this trip more enjoyable - be prepared, not a dumb-ass.

Lunch is provided afterwards and the team is eager to take group photos.  If you are ever in Vegas and looking for something different to do, give them a a call and go in the morning!",5
4954984,"Just ordered my pizza and I have a good feeling about it. I work in the area and craved a slice of pizza so I took to the world of Yelp for recommendations. They have good reviews on Yelp and they were just a couple miles up the road, so I gave it a shot. The lady at the counter has a New York or Jersey accent (I can't tell them apart, sorry). I told her it was my first time and she helped me make a decision (bc I'm indecisive) and I made my own creation. She saw that I had a Yelp coupon for checking in. She happily took it and I just paid the difference bc I the coupon was for a free slice of cheese pizza with a drink. She didn't have to accept my coupon but she did any way. While writing this my pizza came out and my order was called. I went up there and boy does it look good. I'm looking at it as I type. I'm taking my first bite!... I just ate half of it before continuing my review. It is delicious! I'm so lucky I found a pizza joint close to work and home. The prices are low especially for the quality. Definitely coming here again! Sorry, pizza trumps Yelp today and I'm hangry!",5

The service was very good, though not worth  the mandatory 24% gratuity (we had 10 in our party hence the mandatory gratuity) The pizza was good. Good not great... Not average, just not 'wow'. There are so many boutique pizza joints in the valley, and they are all good, I just didn't find anything unique about Cibo's besides the complex Italian naming scheme. We had a big group and they packed us in to a back room with another large group... That's fine, but the acoustics are horrible and it was very hard to hear or carry on a conversation. Regardless, I'll go back, even if only for a glass of wine and dessert but wait until the fall to enjoy their big outdoor dining area.",3

We thought...5 minutes...let's get all 8 pieces fresh. WRONG!!! So many appendages in my chicken. Ew...The batter was crumbly, in a bad way and the chicken was super dry, like beef jerky.

I complained, an of course nothing was done. Yet my credit has inquiry's on it though.

2605868,I really like this place! I like how you can try as many flavors as you want until you get to that one you want to commit to. I had passion fruit which was delish! If you can get over the sketchy location then you won't be disappointed!,5
5150367,"I have been on a search for good soft serve for a couple months when I found out about Tom's Dairy Freeze. I was skeptical because I thought ""just how good can soft serve get?"". I was wrong.

The very BIG ""medium"" cone dipped in chocolate that I got almost brought tears to my eyes. Not simply because it was creamy, delicious, melty and amazing but because it reminded me of my childhood. When I was a kid (I grew up in Russia), we went to Moscow and got a chocolate covered ice cream bar. It was almost identical taste to the soft serve cone dipped in chocolate that I got at Tom's. 

Beware: the ice cream (perhaps because it's real cream and not modified milk ingredient slush) melts REALLY fast. The chocolate was almost falling off my cone. It was so worth it though. I got twist flavour but next time I am going for vanilla alone for the purity of it.

Also, their sizes are generous. A medium really is a large. I've seen people with a large and it is HUGE. I recommend starting off with a small unless you're really sure you want a LOT of soft serve.

I would highly recommend Tom's to anyone who's looking for either good soft serve or good old fashioned ice cream in general.",5

Courtney was understanding and moved our reservations.   We were greeted by Courtney and gave us a choice of two tables.

Remember, I am a fatboy trapped in a skinny mans body.  He promised I wouldn't be disappointed.

As we pulled up to Windsor, my first impression as we walked in the door was WOW.  I feel in love with the way the place was set up.  As we sat down, a friendly waitress came and took our drink and appetizer order.  She brought the drinks but she never brought the appetizers.  Then she came back and took our order.  She brought out our food but never brought out the appetizers.  We asked about the appetizers and she said she was so sorry and brought over her manager.  The manager told us she was sorry for the mishap and would comp our bill $17.00 since they forgot to put in our appetizers.  I couldn't believe this place.  It was like heaven.

They have unique interior design and even better food. i just got one of the 'cheaper' sandwiches and it was so good. i didnt want the sandwich to end. they also had other way good condiments available so that i could add some spice to my sandwich.

I'd recommend it and even take a girl on a date there.",4
1095404,"Convenient location, great customer service, and delicious food. Only bad thing I have to say about this place is it's very pricey (I got the Bison Bowl- which was amazing- but was about $16) You can definitely tell they use quality ingredients and it's super convenient after the gym when you don't have time to prepare your meals, but a little hard for me to spend almost $20 on a bowl for lunch.",4

4511101,This is such a cool place to bring the kids downtown.  I used to always wonder what the inside of this old building looked like and now that they have made this into a museum for kids I have been able to check out the whole inside.  They have lots of stuff for the kids inside and out.  They have special hours when the kids are out of school so check online for that before you head out.,5
42649,"Food was okay, servers were nice but need more experience or should pay more attention to diners needs. There is one white male (owner?) helping out  every time i go to this place this person always wear a printed T-shirt which  doesn't  create a warm welcoming gesture to the diners. This guy should change his attire or just stay inside the kitchen. Sometime you get pandesal if they remember. One time i ordered a bulalo the server said it doesn't come with rice because it is categorized as soup. I know the place is new and will need a lot of changes and adjustments but right now i rate this place one star.",1
1999305,"For a chain restaurant...I was impressed. We stopped in early in a Saturday and were told it would be a 50min wait but bar seating was first come first served. We decided to look around and found a table in the back corner of the bar. It took a little bit but our server finally came over and took our drink order. He was very knowledgeable with the wine list and my wife went with one of his suggestions for a Pinot Grigio and she enjoyed it. I couldn't decide on an entree so I went with some small plates. I started with the lobster bisque which was flavorful but skimpy on the lobster. Next I had a Caesar salad and an order of calamari. The salad was rather large and a good value. The calamari was excellent except for the aioli. I tried a little and decided to stick with the marinara that accompanied it. I'm a calamari traditionalist...what can I say? My wife had the pasta Brio which consisted of rigatoni, grilled chicken, and mushrooms in a roasted red pepper sauce. She liked it and so did I. I'm not a huge fan of chains but Brio does it right. We will definitely be back the next time we decide to visit Crocker Park.",4

Some prices are a bit too high yet just as many and maybe more are surprisingly low.  I'm definitely a fan and it's great that they offer daily half price promotions and that the money the store earns goes toward a good cause.  3$ off coupon if you donate (anything) and a stamp card where once you fill it up you get 30% off your entire purchase. Recommended!",5
3249346,Omg the food was awesome. I know good Mexican food and this was it!! I also got the seal of approval from my sis who only orders rice and beans and ventured out and ordered a taco and tostada which she said was awesome. Please go see Amanda our server !,5
4817323,"What drew me into this store was the absolutely gorgeous display of lamps and hanging light pendants made of glass set in mosaic design.

The owner is an importer of home decor goods primarily from Turkey, Iran and India.  
In addition to the lamps there are brightly colored hand-painted ceramics like bowls and platters which we were were told are done in traditional Ottoman Empire designs.

There are inlaid and carved pieces of furniture and some beautiful carpets.  
If I were to build a Riyad-style Moroccan house, this is where I'd come to accessorize it.

Toward the front of the store I spotted several jewelry cases.  What caught my attention in particular were the pieces of evil eye jewelry.  There were pendants, bracelets, earrings, sun-catchers; evil eye repellers all.

There are many cultures that believe in the necessity of warding off the evil eye.  I come from two of those cultures and I grew up on stories about the ""malocchio"". It wasn't unusual to see someone wearing a gold horn (cornuto) necklace. 

In this shop I purchased the Turkish version of an Evil Eye pendant which is in the shape of an eye.  It's made in Swarovski crystal mosaic.  What I'd tell you if you'd ask, is that I love the way it looks.    But what I'd also like to believe is that it might be giving me a little extra protection to get through the day.

Great shop, with lots to see both for decorating yourself or your house.",4
4937171,"We came here for lunch on a weekday around 11:45 and almost all the tables were occupied. I ordered the kale and arugula salad with shrimp, and it was pretty good considering I never usually order salads at restaurants. I do wish the dressing came on the side; the leaves were almost too drenched. However the shrimp was cooked perfectly and the parsnips and radishes added a nice bitterness and crunch. The cornbread that came with it was amazing as well. I tried a few bites of the shrimp and grits though and instantly wished I had ordered that instead - SO GOOD and had more than just shrimp and grits. So if I ever come back I know what I'm getting. 

The staff were all nice and so is the atmosphere and decor. A bit pricey, but within reason and well worth it.",4

1536277,"I went by there to watch a Panthers game and the whole experience was pretty sub-par. For one, the area we were seated in was right below some speakers and they had the cranked up to 11 and we just about had to yell constantly to have conversation. It was kinda interesting in a way because after a while people just kinda subconsciously gave up on conversation and by the end of the evening a few of us were just sitting there quietly. Anyways, along with our drinks we ordered a pretty good assortment of ""bar"" type food. Sandwiches, wings, chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks, fried pickles, french fries, nachos and even pizza. I sampled a little bit of everything just about since we were all doing a communal snacking type deal and I think the only thing that was even borderline decent was the mini chicken tenders. The nachos had some kind of cheese whiz type sauce which tasted like it was from a jar. I think they brought us 6 or so mozzarella sticks and at least two of them didn't even have any cheese in them. The fried pickles were the soggiest incarnation I've ever tasted and the both the pizza and chicken sandwich were greasy. Overall it was just a crummy meal. They do seem to have a very good drink selection though and a full bar even though the drinks are a little overpriced. If I could say one good thing about the place it is that the wait staff seemed very friendly and was on top of their game. Our server didn't mess anything up and kept all our drinks filled. Another funny note was that the guys running the food to the tables seemed to be clueless as can be. Not only did we get our food but they tried at least 3 additional times to bring us other peoples orders. It's like they had no idea where they were supposed to take the orders.",2

The utensils were disgusting!!! Beyond disgusting! Even the cups. Not sure if they even really clean them? That's how bad they looked. Let's just say i woke up sick who knows if it's from the utensils I used :/. Please get a better dishwasher or whatever you use. Human beings should not eat with that filth.

Then, I met the older lady. She is the reason why I have not returned. She handled the payment because the older gentleman was called in the back. This lady automatically assumed I needed a payment plan. Her attitude was quite condescending. I still bought the ring because it was the perfect gift.

The chapel was beautiful, and the banquet room where the reception was held was perfect. Michelle was our wedding coordinator on the day of the wedding and she was fabulous and so helpful, as was Tony. All of our guests raved about the food and the lighting was wonderful for photos. The package we purchased was so convenient and perfect as well. I would highly recommend this venue as they made our special day as easy & stress free for us as possible.

4273562,"This is absolutely the worst apartment complex I have ever lived in!! For starters the apartment building was built in the late 60's cool I like old buildings and the design of that time, but that doesn't mean that everything had to still be from that time inside. Everything is from the 60's and 70's down to the carpets that is missing in most closets. The ""updated"" tile that they where so proud to tell us about turned out to be Vinyl rolled out to look like tiles....the kitchen flooring is totally coming up from the faulty dishwasher also. Everything just looks dirty and dingy. Not only is everything inside the apartment out of date, but then the hallways haven't seen the light of anything new for a while, correction most hallways the main lobbies have just been freshened with a new coat of trim paint.....went from dingy blue to some type of aqua green stuff that looks like the 80's meet the 70's and decided Miami needed to be invited in....the worst thing of all have been the thefts from Amador every package that we have had to have delivered, I have had to replace almost every order we have ordered here due to the lovely neighbors helping themselves to packages left in door ways.... basically don't move here the only positive is the price but like they say you get what you pay for....",1

2455887,"Gimme Some Sugar has opened a dessert bar/bakery in Henderson.  It was opening day and the baked goods and treats were ready.  The place appears to serve desserts, coffee, and wine (not sandwiches/bread).  They don't open very early (11:00 am) and stay open up into the evening.  It would be a nice place for a casual date, conversation with friends, or an after movie/theatre/church snack. The owners might have come up with a nice niche for their business and hopefully it works because the desserts appear awesome.

The  service was very friendly and the pastry I  had (chocolate brownie/chocolate chip cookie) were really yummy.  The pastry looked like super quality stuff and from what I saw prices ranged from about $3 for cookies/brownies to $4 for very unique macarons to about $7 for very high-end cake desserts.  The more pricey desserts looked big enough to share with a date, spouse, or significant other.

The shop has about ten tables and is nicely decorated and clean.  It has a classy-artsy-bistro feel but is mellow with cool music.  It's tucked away in the corner of a strip mall at 215 and Stephanie, but it is not hard to find.",5

The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. Even after the first visit we had a few questions about a minor change in our dog's condition and Dr. Flick herself called us back in a timely manner. I was surprised at that alone because usually you hear ""bring them in, we can't diagnose over the phone"". The Dr. called us back in a timely manner  and reassure us she would be fine!! We have 3 dogs and Dr.Flick has 3 new patients. I thank all the staff for such a great experience!",5

Janessa I think was our server and Was very efficient and pleasant.  The Chicken Saltimboca was outstanding!  The only reason I did not give 5stars is there is no atmosphere.  It is in a strip mall but it would not be a Saturday night date choice.  It is all tables with nothing, not sure if it meant something but a car painted on the wall.  Let's make it look Itallian.  Maybe some red checkered table clothes, a candle on the table, a scene from Italy on the wall.  Some screens or plants to offer a little separation.  This place is awesome just need to ambience.",4

Actually no not really, but everyone is super polite and it is clean! Talking about polite, Marie and Theresa are the two individuals who I prefer to deal with, out of anybody, working here, but if they are not there, anyone will do, but those two ladies are super awesome!

So before, there once use to be several Whataburgers locations closer to where I lived. That is no longer the case and I am a sad panda.  I always order a #2 (Double meat Whataburger), add cheese, extra pickles, extra onions and extra mustard on the bun! I feel those three things help perfectly clash with each other so I can fully savor the meat and the overall meal. The staff never even judges me or gripes about me wanting all the extra stuff. 

The fries, always crisp and golden and not too salty, but enough salt to have with the ""Fancy Ketchup"" ! I always grab extra ""fancy ketchup"" here to take home with me.

Onion rings taste sooooooooooooooo good. Add some ranch for 30 some cents, and yep.. 


Inside, like I said, clean.. but they play 50s-60s music, and it is music I grew up listening to, so I like the ambiance! 

What I like is that I can go in at the 3am and sit down and my food is cooked just as fresh as if I ordered it at 2pm! This place is open 24 hours so this place is legendary in my book. Yes, I said it, LEGENDARY!

Here are the downsides.

You have to eat the food right there and then, right away.
Not one closer to me.

89296,"I visited Elmwood Spa with my mom for Mother's Day and overall we had a good experience. We had lunch first, following which I had a manicure and pedicure and my mom had a facial and manicure. Lunch was pretty good - nothing special but nothing to really complain about either. My mom really enjoyed her facial and said her esthetician was very skilled, knowledgeable and happy to answer a few questions that she had. I was a bit disappointed by the manicure and pedicure facilities. There are quite a few stations (almost too many for the room) which feel kind of squished together. The chairs aren't particularly comfy - there are no massage armchairs here. The room was also quite noisy and difficult to relax in. The quality of both my manicure and pedicure wasn't quite as good as I was expecting for a spa. Considering Elmwood charges significantly more than Nailsense, which I usually visit to get my nails done, I wasn't blown away. 

The customer service was quite good and everyone was friendly and helpful. The facilities are also nice and very clean. Overall, I would visit Elmwood spa again for other services, just not to get my nails done as I'm not sure its worth the steep price.",3

The place was super packed when we got there, they only had the bar and high top tables available at the moment. The bar was actually super nice so we got seated there. 

We were immediately greeted by our server Nicole, sick tattoos btw. I've asked her about their mimosas and she said there were different types of mimosas that they can make. She listed them all and introduced this blueberry lavender mimosa that was pureeeeeeeee delicious and amazing. It was definitely something that we both haven tried before. The taste of it was just amazing and perfect for brunch. 

I've ordered the eggs Benedict and my best friend ordered the crab cake Benedict's. The food came super quickly and I was super impressed at how our server kept checking up on us and even filling up our cups with water without disturbing us! 

Let's talk food. My eggs Benedict was amaaaaaaazing. Delicious, I wish they were more generous with the hollandise sauce but overall it was great. The smashed potatoe hash browns were sooooo perfect. Crispy, hot and soft in the inside. I loved how they also saut√©ed other veggies with the hash. It was delicious. I think I would get the crab cake Benedict's next time, my friend said it was amazing and something she has never ordered before. 

When I asked for the bill, Nicole our server totally surprised us with a birthday treat for my friend. We were so awed with the surprise that it totally made our day. Plus we would definitely be coming back just to snack on those donuts. It was pure goodness. 

Can't wait to try their fried chicken next time.

Happy eating fellow yelpers!",5
