I booked a large group here for my Wedding Rehearsal dinner. I wanted something that had a private-ish area for our group, but had character and good food!

We ended up booking an area downstairs with tall bar tables and stools. There were also other private dining rooms you can book out as well. When I was planning this, it was super easy. They have a $30 per person set menu that comes with an antipasto plate with appetizers and cured meats and cheeses. Then I could choose from their menu any pizza I wanted which they will determine the number that are made and come out based on 3-4 slices a person. 
It also includes dessert which they also determined on the day, but there was TONS of food and LOTS of leftovers. 
I could also pre-order wine which was a great suggestion as then with the group people could just state ""white"" or ""red"" and it was ready to go. You only pay for what you drink. 

The servers were friendly, and was really good at adjusting the price based on the number of people that did not show up. 
I loved that the resto was able to overall just make you pay for what you eat without over charging. 

I've never been to Libretto before, but love that they have unique pizza choices, all that were very good. My favourite was the Spicy Sausage pizza. (as opposed to the house made sausage). The Duck Confit was good too but didn't have enough taste for me. 
For apps, they gave us a bunch of food, but the most memorable was the Gnocchi and we couldn't stop eating it. 
For dessert, we got the infamous tiramisu which was amazing.

There is also an option for Spelt Crust!",5
2,AMAZING!! I got a reasonable quote and they came the next day.   Not only did they pick up my junk but they swept up any debris around the area.   Very professional and friendly.   Will use them again for sure.,5
4,I have been going here for years and expect a student massage. Last week I went because I was in so much back pain. I got lucky and had Willie Reese as my student therapist. He hit so many tiger points I was pain free all week. I returned this week for 2 hours with Willie and OMG.....painfully but very rewarding. I have never been treated better. I am out of pain!!!!!,5
6,"Just returned from a fabulous anniversary trip to Las Vegas. We booked a fountain view room at the Bellagio and we were not disappointed, the lady at check in asked if we had a preference for floor and we told her to give us the best in her opinion, so we were placed on the 28th floor. The elevators are a thrill ride, LOL ZOOOOM! We walked in the room and WOW! The Eiffel tower at the Paris and the entire fountain area like a postcard!
 Best room I have every had in Vegas. Comfy bed and pillows, very clean and fully stocked (but pricey) mini bar. LOL, But vending and ice was just up the hall. 
Casino was fun. better class of folks for the most part, but still a party atmosphere. Actually didnt do too bad and came home with winnings! 
WE do tip well, so we had some really good bell & valet service. Really not sure why anyone would complain, unless nothing pleases them. It was one of the best experiences I have had traveling, and the place is JUST GORGEOUS!! The flowers alone are worth the visit! 
The resort is not for folks who want to get stupid and loud, head to hard Rock if thats your thing. It does have that high end elegance that many casinos and hotels are missing in town.
Also if you LOVE high end shopping ( even if its just the window variety) you can spend a day inside and around the resort. its located in a fun spot on the strip. The money they didnt get at slots I spent at Giardini for beautiful Italian ceramics! Better than a cheap T-shirt, LOL.
Then there is Jean Phillipes Patisserie, with the giant chocolate fountain. Not just decadent sweets, but great Panini and crepes for lunch, and we made it our go to for coffee and Brioche for breakfast. Grab something and go sit by the pool with the paper ( Only for guests) .
Awesome dinner on your checklist? We chose Le Cirque at the Bellagio.  If French food is your thing,and you like to dress to impress, its one of the best. The service was amazing, the decor & the plates were wonderful and the food Gourmet. They helped me arrange a surprise for our anniversary and presented the table with a Beautiful cake from Jean Phillipes in our anniversary colors! 5 star+ to their whole team!!
I cant wait to return again!!!",5
9,"Just the patio I've been looking for: delicious sandwiches, homemade fries, fresh salads, cold beer, and a convivial atmosphere.",5
11,"At first glance Ecletica home seemed to be overwhelming but upon walking in you are greeted cheerfully and offered help and told about any sales or specials going on. 
The windchimes in the front are gorgeous! And there are so many different things, if you really take the time to look you could be in each room a while! The best part is they have new stuff added all the time. They aren't a brand new store they do consignment but also have some new.. But hey one mans trash might be another's treasure! 
I love the vases I bought and the entryway table. All around great experience!",5
12,Unbelievable. Especially for the cheap price. My fianc√© and I make an effort to come here every time we drive through Vegas. It's so delicious!,5
15,The prefix brunch menu was unexpected but delightful. Each item was brought to us and it was delicious. The service was friendly and the ambience was just right for our annual girls trip to Vegas. We felt like we were treating ourselves to the nice life.,5
16,"My friend and I were just shopping around (I love to daydream about completely remodeling my house) and even though it was probably obvious that we weren't ready to buy, Brandon was still very nice and helpful with all of our many questions. I love the no-pressure sales of this place. It felt like he was less of a sales guy and more like a friend who just happens to know everything about their furniture. When I do need stuff this is the place to go and Brandon is the guy to see. The cookies and popcorn are great too!",5
17,"I needed some help on making better choices for food.  This is actually really GOOD FOOD that I don't feel guilty eating.  Another benefit is that it actually costs me far less than eating out everyday.  So, in short I eat better tasting food for less money, and it just happens to be healthier.  I look forward to using this service for the long haul....",5
18,The bruschetta is really good. Service is great. Everything had great flavour. Underrated restaurant. Recommended for a date night or just a night out with the family.,5
19,"I am big on Food Safety and when I see food safety violations (especially when someone else is cooking my food), I feel propelled to say something. I stopped by here and placed my order. The female taking my order called another employee over who was on the line cooking the food to help her with a cash register issue. The employee stop making the food, walked over and started handling the money and pressing buttons on the cash register. I ordered through the drive through so I can see how nasty the monitor was on the cash register. 

The female that finished handling the cash register issues went back to make the food without exchanging gloves. I said something immediately and to my surprise the original cashier clerk defended her action as if she was scared to correct her. This happens in the workplace a lot. People see others violating rules and dont say anything to ""keep the peace"". 
I was sooo mad, I told the cashier ""Forget it"" I dont want this food and drove off not even negotiating my refund. 

I have eaten here many of time and had great experiences. I just had to post this so the whomever is in charge can round up the employees and remind them about Food Safety and not be to lazy to wash their hands or change gloves when touching other things away from the food prepping line. Customers are watching.",1
20,This was my first time going to the dentist and I'm so happy I stumbled upon this place. Dr. Irene Han was so nice and informative. Looking forward to my next visit.,5
22,Very loud music but it was worth it for the fabulous nicely priced sushi! Fun wait staff and great fast service. The TIGER ROLE was amazing.,5
23,I travel all over Texas and have a favorite bbq food truck in Austin and now I have a place just as good in Phoenix. Now I understand how they have 5 stars with over 1700 reviews. I've bookmarked Little Miss BBQ and will be back.,5
24,"We arrived at 11:30am for lunch on a friday and it was already almost full. We got a table and quick friendly service. Food was delicious.  I tasted the signature curry, green curry chicken, pad Thai and chicken fried rice.",5
25,Excellent dealership! Great experience as usual.,5
26,"We go here as a family 2 or 3 times a month. We love it!  The service is always top-notch! The fideo soup that comes before the entree is delicious.  Food is excellent - always.  If you have any space for dessert, go for it!  They are all great - my favorite is the mango.",5
27,Came into the store today and came out with a cracked door handle. Then the staff themselves is extremely rude and tried to pin the issue with me! Do not waste your money with these guys!! Nothing but some crooks!,1
28,"One of my favs in the valley. Breakfast, lunch or dinner this place brings its A game! This place is a must try. The scallops and risotto are everything!",5
30,Great place to eat korean barbecue. You can't go wrong. Friendly staff too. We'll be back.  AYCE for $16.99 is great...,5
31,"Not sure why there are so many negative reviews here. Let me point out a few things that matter when you enter a brand store like Canada Goose.
1. The material and the offerings this brand has for Winter wear is of no match to any other brand and hence the price does all the justice. It comes with a 10 year warranty, what else would you need.
2. Such stores are always jam packed and its very difficult for any sales associate to handle multiple at the same time. Yes, even if you deploy a soldier of sales men, its not enough for such a store
3. What they offer is promising and  they do no compromise on quality or safety when it comes to winter wear.
4. The sales associate 'Luna' was super sweet to us. Though it was the peek of season and super busy, she was kind enough to answer every question and took time to explain every detail of the varieties they had at the store.
I do not need to recommend this brand to anyone. Those who own this know the worth of it. It is indeed a life time investment worth every penny.",5
33,"This is one of my favorite restaurants.  I have been there numerous times since they've opened and the food has always been delicious and the service has been outstanding.  The bruschetta board, Tomasos meatballs, house made pasta and sauce are my go to items.  The cocktails are fabulous as well.  Most recently I sat outside at the bar with my friend and Nicole the bartender was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  I will be back for sure!",5
34,"I discovered Las Vegas ATV Tours via Groupon and read some of the mixed (but mostly good) review via Trip Advisor and Yelp.  Overall, it seemed like everyone was super happy with their tour.

Communication is a little spotty at times, but mainly because it's a mom and pop kind of business and everyone works in that joint.  After a tour is when these guys respond to your emails and phone calls.  

We signed up for the One Hour Tour.  John picked us up from The Four Seasons Hotel along with other folks from different hotels on the strip and we headed towards the Motor Speedway where they dropped us off next to the Airforce base.  It's about a 30 mins drive. To begin with, I have never driven an ATV before, but I owned a scooter for seven years and have driven a motorcycle, so I am well aware of how to dress on a moving vehicle.  However, a few of the gals did not.  

Girls - be smart, not stupid.  Wear pants and choose the morning session in the summer.  It's simply too hot to do this tour in the middle of the afternoon.  You'll die.  Second, wear moisture wicking clothes as you will sweat and pour water all over your body.  Bring a light long sleeved shirt.  The sun is strong and no matter how much sunscreen you apply, you'll be thankful for the coverage when the wind picks up and sand is blowing onto your bare arms.  Second, wear old tennis shoes. Not TOMS, not Keds, not sandals.  Again, don't be an idiot, you are in the desert on a 4-wheeler.  The pedals have metal prongs and you need protection from the heat of the engine.

Last, bring a small backpack filled with water, extra sunscreen, ibuprofen, kleenex (i.e. toilet paper), chapstick and a bandana.  While the group gives you a water during the half time break, they only bring enough water for one bottle per person.  It's hot outside and the heat definitely got to me.  I wish I would have brought extra water and a bandana to cover my mouth from all the dirt.

Now, onto the tour.  I thought it was amazing.  The guys are tatted up, smoke and good ole' boys - they know what they are doing.  They did a great job describing what we would be doing and the hand signals to follow.  They also had extra riders to round up the caboose and let the girls ride tandem in the event they were too scared to drive an ATV.  They warm you up with an easy start filled with small bumps and hills.  As you become more comfortable with the ATV,  you  have the option to be more aggressive as you trust the machine over time.  They definitely make it clear to do whatever you feel most comfortable with and they never make you feel stupid for taking it slow and careful.  They know the area like the back of their dry, tan hands and do their job well.

Honestly, a one hour would have sufficed for me, as it's hot and physically exhausting, but we winded up riding two hours.  I'm not complaining, it was great fun, but for a retreat recreation I am planning in September, I would recommend to my older clients to perhaps consider just an hour as it is very physically demanding.  Also, your gas is in what looks like a gear shift on your right handle bar, it's a lot of strain to your right hand - it doesn't work like a motorcycle.  So be prepared for some terrible texting, post tour.

I winded up flying over a ""Witch's Eye"" and into a dune, causing me to almost flip over the handlebars.  I didn't, but winded up jamming my right thigh into the throttle and right handlebar.  It left a nasty bruise, cut and whiplash, but it was all worth it.  The staff was great - they made sure I was OK, gave me water and asked several times if I wanted to stop and go back.  I assured them I was OK, and while I definitely felt it the next day...and today...I am still so happy I did the tour.  It was great to get out into the desert, out of the strip, see the jets fly above you and meet some new people. I definitely would recommend this group and Casey as your guide.  To make this trip more enjoyable - be prepared, not a dumb-ass.

Lunch is provided afterwards and the team is eager to take group photos.  If you are ever in Vegas and looking for something different to do, give them a a call and go in the morning!",5
35,"Just ordered my pizza and I have a good feeling about it. I work in the area and craved a slice of pizza so I took to the world of Yelp for recommendations. They have good reviews on Yelp and they were just a couple miles up the road, so I gave it a shot. The lady at the counter has a New York or Jersey accent (I can't tell them apart, sorry). I told her it was my first time and she helped me make a decision (bc I'm indecisive) and I made my own creation. She saw that I had a Yelp coupon for checking in. She happily took it and I just paid the difference bc I the coupon was for a free slice of cheese pizza with a drink. She didn't have to accept my coupon but she did any way. While writing this my pizza came out and my order was called. I went up there and boy does it look good. I'm looking at it as I type. I'm taking my first bite!... I just ate half of it before continuing my review. It is delicious! I'm so lucky I found a pizza joint close to work and home. The prices are low especially for the quality. Definitely coming here again! Sorry, pizza trumps Yelp today and I'm hangry!",5
36,"Bad 1st experience! Charged for something I didn't ask for or receive. The young lady at the drive thru was rude and incompetent, it's just coffee and a danish. How do you screw that up? Will never visit this store again especially if she's on the window. Bottom line, put friendly people on the window who can place an order and swipe a card.",1
37,"A must while visiting Las Vegas at the Venetian Resort & Casino.

If you're at all like me when I visit Vegas it's 24-7 non-stop ... so to take a break at the Breathe Oxygen Bar and ""detox"" it's mandatory!!  While inhaling pure oxygen we got massages and pulse stimulation as well as aromatherapy!

Situated right on the canal you can see the gondolas float by and hear some magical signing - this also creates a nice tranquil feeling.

This is a place I always visit when in town.",5
40,"Watch out for these guys. Don't give them any of your info unless your serious about an item in store. They will run the hell out of your credit which if you know about credit it will drop your score of course. I already had an account an they still ran my credit over 3 times seriously while I already had an established account that I was paying on without my consent to do so. I complained, an of course nothing was done. Yet my credit has inquiry's on it though. Be careful an if possible avoid this one at Az Mills as everyone isn't the same so you might get better treatment at another store just not this one I'll say. Take care.",1
41,I really like this place! I like how you can try as many flavors as you want until you get to that one you want to commit to. I had passion fruit which was delish! If you can get over the sketchy location then you won't be disappointed!,5
42,"I have been on a search for good soft serve for a couple months when I found out about Tom's Dairy Freeze. I was skeptical because I thought ""just how good can soft serve get?"". I was wrong.

The very BIG ""medium"" cone dipped in chocolate that I got almost brought tears to my eyes. Not simply because it was creamy, delicious, melty and amazing but because it reminded me of my childhood. When I was a kid (I grew up in Russia), we went to Moscow and got a chocolate covered ice cream bar. It was almost identical taste to the soft serve cone dipped in chocolate that I got at Tom's. 

Beware: the ice cream (perhaps because it's real cream and not modified milk ingredient slush) melts REALLY fast. The chocolate was almost falling off my cone. It was so worth it though. I got twist flavour but next time I am going for vanilla alone for the purity of it.

Also, their sizes are generous. A medium really is a large. I've seen people with a large and it is HUGE. I recommend starting off with a small unless you're really sure you want a LOT of soft serve.

I would highly recommend Tom's to anyone who's looking for either good soft serve or good old fashioned ice cream in general.",5
43,I read the reviews and decided we should try Flipside!  The reviews mentioned that they use local produce and farms.  Reason 1!   Reviews also stated how clean and delicious everything is.  I made reservations because I wanted to make sure we did not have a wait .   I had to call back because one person in our party was stuck in traffic.  Courtney was understanding and moved our reservations.   We were greeted by Courtney and gave us a choice of two tables.  It was a great experience from the questions we had about menu to the dessert!   I highly recommend this place.   Thank for a wonderful meal and giving us time to visit with our VIP.,5
44,"Came to Phoenix for a couple days and I had bookmark this breakfast place. 

This place is really busy. Yet my boyfriend and I 
had a great experience. Our server was amazing. I forgot her name but I know she's German and Filipino, she was very attentive.

I had ordered the chicken fried steak with a gluten free banana muffin and I believe my boyfriend ordered the 5 egg white omelette with a gluten free banana pecan pancake. Everything was really good.",5
45,"I'm used to going to brunch after 1pm so I guess you really couldn't call it brunch.  I had just gotten out of church when I received a phone call from my best friend W.  He asked if I want to go eat at Windsor.  I had never been to Windsor and, of course I complained because I didn't think they were going to give me enough food to fill me up.  Remember, I am a fatboy trapped in a skinny mans body.  He promised I wouldn't be disappointed.

As we pulled up to Windsor, my first impression as we walked in the door was WOW.  I feel in love with the way the place was set up.  As we sat down, a friendly waitress came and took our drink and appetizer order.  She brought the drinks but she never brought the appetizers.  Then she came back and took our order.  She brought out our food but never brought out the appetizers.  We asked about the appetizers and she said she was so sorry and brought over her manager.  The manager told us she was sorry for the mishap and would comp our bill $17.00 since they forgot to put in our appetizers.  I couldn't believe this place.  It was like heaven.

Needless to say, my meal left me full and satisfied.  The service was great.  The atmosphere was wonderful, and the staff was amazing.  I think I have found my new spot every Sunday afternoon after church.",5
47,"Husband and I were at the Antique Mall on New Year's day.  OMG talk about busy - WOW.  The sales were amazing with bargains galore.  There was only one drawback and that was the check-out line.  It was half way around the store, but the sales prices were well worth the wait.  The other antique stores better smarten up and open on NEW YEAR'S DAY.  They are loosing out on HUGE amounts of money by not opening.",5
48,"Excited by the preceding reviews, had a lovely reunion dinner with family and a particularly splendid meal. The service was quite attentive and sensitive to allergies, and that included everyone who served us. 

Every tapas-style dish was well-seasoned and complex and so palate-pleasing!  Too bad we're just visiting Toronto. Would come back again and again!",5
49,"Bought their most expensive package - ""full royalty detailing"". Utter disappointment and a complete waste of money.

- Carpet was not shampooed -  coffee spill (primary reason for visit) was barely touched
- Windshield/windows were not even wiped at all from the inside
- They did not clean under the cupholder rubber insert, tons of visible dirt was left behind. 
- They did not properly clean trunk upholstery, lots of dirt/dust left behind.
- The leather seats were not cleaned -at all-

Basically you're paying 200 bucks for some kid to do a bad job vacuuming your car and wiping the dash.  Find a better detailer - AVOID THIS PLACE!",1
52,"Extremely over priced.  Asked for military crease on shirts.  Low and behold, no crease.",1
55,"Decent food and fast delivery paired with excellent customer service (one of my dishes had an issue and they replaced it was a very tasty, higher priced item of my choice and added a drink on top of it!)
Absolutely to recommend.",5
56,This is such a cool place to bring the kids downtown.  I used to always wonder what the inside of this old building looked like and now that they have made this into a museum for kids I have been able to check out the whole inside.  They have lots of stuff for the kids inside and out.  They have special hours when the kids are out of school so check online for that before you head out.,5
57,"Food was okay, servers were nice but need more experience or should pay more attention to diners needs. There is one white male (owner?) helping out  every time i go to this place this person always wear a printed T-shirt which  doesn't  create a warm welcoming gesture to the diners. This guy should change his attire or just stay inside the kitchen. Sometime you get pandesal if they remember. One time i ordered a bulalo the server said it doesn't come with rice because it is categorized as soup. I know the place is new and will need a lot of changes and adjustments but right now i rate this place one star.",1
60,"Another thrift store where once I enter there is no coming out empty handed. Love how well organized, open and clean this one is. Dressing rooms are awesome. Some prices are a bit too high yet just as many and maybe more are surprisingly low.  I'm definitely a fan and it's great that they offer daily half price promotions and that the money the store earns goes toward a good cause.  3$ off coupon if you donate (anything) and a stamp card where once you fill it up you get 30% off your entire purchase. Recommended!",5
61,Omg the food was awesome. I know good Mexican food and this was it!! I also got the seal of approval from my sis who only orders rice and beans and ventured out and ordered a taco and tostada which she said was awesome. Please go see Amanda our server !,5
65,"This is a very clean facility, the staff Rene fully explained everything. They want to make sure that you are comfortable with the place that you are storing your belongings. I would definitely recommend using Public Storage.",5
66,"Dont' go here.It was full of shady looking people and I didn't see one security officer. 

I left as quickly as I arrived. Too bad, it's a nice building and could be so much more.",1
67,"If you are truly into vinyl, you MUST visit this store, BOTH locations! I have found some serious treasures here! We love the Record City Crew!! Joey, Stacy, Brandi and Killian are some of the nicest people you will ever meet and they take great care of their repeat customers! 

My Family and I have been shopping here for many years and I can honestly say they have THE BEST PRICES IN TOWN! Their classic rock and metal inventory is outstanding and the majority of SEALED albums in my collection have come from Record City! Price, selection and QUALITY keeps me coming back to RC on a regular basis! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND RECORD CITY!!",5
68,"Great spot and great staff 
I had a 3 taco plate with beans and rice 2 chicken tacos and 1 fish taco.
My daughter also had the 3 taco plate with beans and rice she had hers with shrimp tacos...everything was delicious..While we were eating i checked us in on yelp and they gace ilus 2 fried oreos which my daughter ate both and loved..
Ohhh yeah i almost forgot...they were having a taco eating contest when we were there too..its like a $12 buy in and lasts 10 minutes..so we had a lil entertainment while we ate.
They also run happy hr from 4-7 pm Monday-Friday with $1.25 tacos..cant beat that at all..
I'll definitely be back..",5
70,Every stereotype of a mechanic shop taking advantage of an eighty year old woman was in play recently when my mother was able to spend more than her pension check after taking her car in for an coupon oil change!  DO NOT GO THERE!,1
72,"Went to this place a few years ago because of good reviews. The older gentleman was very pleasant and really made me feel welcome. I really thought I found myself a neighborhood jeweler. Then, I met the older lady. She is the reason why I have not returned. She handled the payment because the older gentleman was called in the back. This lady automatically assumed I needed a payment plan. Her attitude was quite condescending. I still bought the ring because it was the perfect gift. It was first and final purchase from this place. What a shame because I really liked the older gentleman and wanted to support local business.",1
73,This is our favorite Mexican place we've been to since moving to Az. Tastes authentic and delicious.,5
74,The absolute BEST!!!!  Quality food and service!  You won't regret ordering anything here ever!,5
75,"We had our wedding here last month and coming from out of state we hadn't had the chance to see the venue in person prior to the wedding so set our expectations low (just in case!); fortunately, the venue was more than just a pleasant surprise! The chapel was beautiful, and the banquet room where the reception was held was perfect. Michelle was our wedding coordinator on the day of the wedding and she was fabulous and so helpful, as was Tony. All of our guests raved about the food and the lighting was wonderful for photos. The package we purchased was so convenient and perfect as well. I would highly recommend this venue as they made our special day as easy & stress free for us as possible. We were so happy with how our wedding turned out, it was so beautiful and the evening was so much fun for us and all of our guests.",5
76,"This is absolutely the worst apartment complex I have ever lived in!! For starters the apartment building was built in the late 60's cool I like old buildings and the design of that time, but that doesn't mean that everything had to still be from that time inside. Everything is from the 60's and 70's down to the carpets that is missing in most closets. The ""updated"" tile that they where so proud to tell us about turned out to be Vinyl rolled out to look like tiles....the kitchen flooring is totally coming up from the faulty dishwasher also. Everything just looks dirty and dingy. Not only is everything inside the apartment out of date, but then the hallways haven't seen the light of anything new for a while, correction most hallways the main lobbies have just been freshened with a new coat of trim paint.....went from dingy blue to some type of aqua green stuff that looks like the 80's meet the 70's and decided Miami needed to be invited in....the worst thing of all have been the thefts from Amador every package that we have had to have delivered, I have had to replace almost every order we have ordered here due to the lovely neighbors helping themselves to packages left in door ways.... basically don't move here the only positive is the price but like they say you get what you pay for....",1
77,"This place is still rock solid!  We ordered the garlic spareribs and were AMAZED at how good it was.  

Imagine fried minced garlic that taste like mini croutons.  A heaping mound of it was tossed on top of the fried ribs.  I've never had anything like it.  I was shoveling spoonfuls of it into my mouth....",5
78,"Gimme Some Sugar has opened a dessert bar/bakery in Henderson.  It was opening day and the baked goods and treats were ready.  The place appears to serve desserts, coffee, and wine (not sandwiches/bread).  They don't open very early (11:00 am) and stay open up into the evening.  It would be a nice place for a casual date, conversation with friends, or an after movie/theatre/church snack. The owners might have come up with a nice niche for their business and hopefully it works because the desserts appear awesome.

The  service was very friendly and the pastry I  had (chocolate brownie/chocolate chip cookie) were really yummy.  The pastry looked like super quality stuff and from what I saw prices ranged from about $3 for cookies/brownies to $4 for very unique macarons to about $7 for very high-end cake desserts.  The more pricey desserts looked big enough to share with a date, spouse, or significant other.

The shop has about ten tables and is nicely decorated and clean.  It has a classy-artsy-bistro feel but is mellow with cool music.  It's tucked away in the corner of a strip mall at 215 and Stephanie, but it is not hard to find.",5
79,"Our dog saw Dr. Flick and she was wonderful and very caring and sincere!! She explained everything very clear and made sure we knew all of our options. She worked with us to find the most affordable care plan that was just as beneficial to our dogs health. She did not make us feel rushed even though we had a million questions. The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. Even after the first visit we had a few questions about a minor change in our dog's condition and Dr. Flick herself called us back in a timely manner. I was surprised at that alone because usually you hear ""bring them in, we can't diagnose over the phone"". The Dr. called us back in a timely manner  and reassure us she would be fine!! We have 3 dogs and Dr.Flick has 3 new patients. I thank all the staff for such a great experience!",5
80,This is an awesome little place in little Italy. It's like stepping back in time the wall paper and the paneling make this a great atmosphere. We've been here many times. Why you ask? Well the food is always delicious and consistent the service is always wonderful. You can't go wrong at Guarino's. Normally I get the eggplant Rollup's but this time I decided to try something new. I had the chicken piccata and it didn't disappoint it was wonderful. Everyone enjoyed their meals and we had a wonderful evening. I highly recommend this place as a top stop for Little Italy.,5
82,"These guys know whats up. Took the time to tell me about some tire problems that I had, and even asked me if I drive the car 'aggressively' as they would have set it up a bit different. Not many places left that actually seem like specialist of a trade. Will be going back for sure!",5
83,"Great place to go get your haircut, everyone is nice and the price is right. Lots of hot spanish chicks work here too if you are a guy (no homo).  Try and come during the week when it is slower rather than on Saturdays when it is busy as all get out. I don't know if this place competes against D'Avance Beauty Salon. And what does the D' mean and why is it so popular here.",5
85,"Boooyaahhh! I ate it, so I will rate it! I am such a regular here that the staff refers to me by first name or with a big excited smile knowing I am back! Actually no not really, but everyone is super polite and it is clean! Talking about polite, Marie and Theresa are the two individuals who I prefer to deal with, out of anybody, working here, but if they are not there, anyone will do, but those two ladies are super awesome!

So before, there once use to be several Whataburgers locations closer to where I lived. That is no longer the case and I am a sad panda.  I always order a #2 (Double meat Whataburger), add cheese, extra pickles, extra onions and extra mustard on the bun! I feel those three things help perfectly clash with each other so I can fully savor the meat and the overall meal. The staff never even judges me or gripes about me wanting all the extra stuff. 

The fries, always crisp and golden and not too salty, but enough salt to have with the ""Fancy Ketchup"" ! I always grab extra ""fancy ketchup"" here to take home with me.

Onion rings taste sooooooooooooooo good. Add some ranch for 30 some cents, and yep.. 


Inside, like I said, clean.. but they play 50s-60s music, and it is music I grew up listening to, so I like the ambiance! 

What I like is that I can go in at the 3am and sit down and my food is cooked just as fresh as if I ordered it at 2pm! This place is open 24 hours so this place is legendary in my book. Yes, I said it, LEGENDARY!

Here are the downsides.

You have to eat the food right there and then, right away.
Not one closer to me.
If you Whatasize the Fries, it's the same size as the large fries! Don't do it!",5
86,I was super impressed with the quality of the workmanship as well as the friendly and helpful service! I had to rent a car while they put the new top on my Mustang. Ken gave me a ride to Enterprise both to pick up a car and to drop it off when my car was done. My new soft top looks better than it did when I first bought my car! I highly recommend this business!,5
87,"The food and service is exceptional. They offer a military discount, which is very nice. Decent prices and good value. I recommend.",5
90,"I love this tropical smoothie, customer service is always great and food is amazing!  Seems like this is the only one that has macroni salad. Love this place!",5
91,"This restaurant was rated top 10 new restaurant in 2017 according to weekly magazine so we came today. We ordered spanakopita for appetizer, tsipoura- grilled whole fish and solomos -grilled organic salmon and they were all delicious. The place was so nice and servers were excellent.",5
93,"Friendly people; smiley; ready to serve; and, indeed, fabulous, clean, healthy, multifruity, and mouth-watering cinnamon rolls and beverages! 

Everybody MUST go there--Cinnaholic, on Tropical (across from Walmart & Sam's club) and taste for themselves!!

My wife and I LOVE the fresh, hot, and delicious rolls

94,"Breakfast this morning was very good both in size and cost. We were immediately seated and our waiter, Ulitis, was very good. We will come again.",5
95,It started with very friendly reception staff. Then probably the best facial I've ever had with Nicole!  Such wonderful products. Bonus that they do online booking.,5
99,"It was my best friend's birthday and I wanted to treat her to brunch. This place was in between us and we wanted to try it for the longest time. The place was super packed when we got there, they only had the bar and high top tables available at the moment. The bar was actually super nice so we got seated there. 

We were immediately greeted by our server Nicole, sick tattoos btw. I've asked her about their mimosas and she said there were different types of mimosas that they can make. She listed them all and introduced this blueberry lavender mimosa that was pureeeeeeeee delicious and amazing. It was definitely something that we both haven tried before. The taste of it was just amazing and perfect for brunch. 

I've ordered the eggs Benedict and my best friend ordered the crab cake Benedict's. The food came super quickly and I was super impressed at how our server kept checking up on us and even filling up our cups with water without disturbing us! 

Let's talk food. My eggs Benedict was amaaaaaaazing. Delicious, I wish they were more generous with the hollandise sauce but overall it was great. The smashed potatoe hash browns were sooooo perfect. Crispy, hot and soft in the inside. I loved how they also saut√©ed other veggies with the hash. It was delicious. I think I would get the crab cake Benedict's next time, my friend said it was amazing and something she has never ordered before. 

When I asked for the bill, Nicole our server totally surprised us with a birthday treat for my friend. We were so awed with the surprise that it totally made our day. Plus we would definitely be coming back just to snack on those donuts. It was pure goodness. 

Can't wait to try their fried chicken next time.

Happy eating fellow yelpers!",5
100,"The pancakes are as good in real life as they look on Instagram! Went here for brunch and loved everything. There was of course, a lineup but it moved quite quickly if you get there early enough. We waited for maybe 30 minutes. Fresh juice, great coffee, and delicious dishes! Found the staff to be personable and friendly. I didn't need to eat for the rest of the day!",5
101,"Honestly this is one of my favorite places to stay. I have stayed here a total of 6 times. I prefer the tower rooms over the pyramid rooms, mainly because of the space, and the restrooms are much nicer in the tower. the atmosphere here is amazing. They have amazing bartenders, and cocktail waitresses. A few times a year they always send me free rooms, which a majority of the time I use them. Their buffet isn't the best buffet on the strip, but I think it is up there. I would prefer they would serve fresh steamed crab legs, instead of serving them on ice, but a majority of buffets do that. I do wish they had more table games, especially the roulette tables. A lot of the time the place isn't to packed, and I love all the different restaurants they have, and stores. I would recommend this place to anyone staying on the strip.",5
102,Excellent chicken and waffles inexpensive and laid back experience. Friendly staff... No really long wait times. Two people ate for under twenty dollars. Will be back tonight lol,5
103,"To give some context, I have been to many PT's and many body workers. I've even been a body worker. Scott is, so far, the best I've encountered. Do NOT go to Scott if you want to lay on a table and get rubbed for a while. It's not about relaxation. Your body is your temple and all that, but it's also a machine, and if the pulleys and levers are out of place/sync/whack, then no amount of epsom salt and meditation is going to cure what ails ya. Just like how you gotta work out to get stronger, you gotta work on your injuries to make them better.

I spend a very large portion of my life either rock climbing or hiking somewhere to film someone else rock climbing. The rest of my life is spent behind a computer, seated, in what is possibly the most unhealthy bodily configuration for someone with chronically tight forearms, upper arms, chest, and back. Add to that some chronic elbow tendonitis (or -osis, whatever), a hectic schedule living on the road, and you have a recipe for a bundle of chronic pain and limited mobility.

I keep most of this crap at bay with self-therapy, but that only goes so far. It feels like vacuuming the kitchen floor, when really, it needs a mop.

Scott is that mop.

In 90 minutes, he took my forearm extensors to the bone, gave 'em some active release....from typing, my pronators are as taut as a piano string. He isolated those bastards and gave 'em what for. The back, neck, and shoulder work was incredible, as I could open my chest afterward...which is rare for those of us with hypertrophied backs who rarely use our pushing muscles.

If I'm in town long enough, I'm going back.",5
105,"Biaggio joins Bo from Yi Mei Champion Deli on the list of the absolute nicest owners you could ever meet. People like Biaggio are the precise reason why we need to support our local businesses. Great food. Personal service. Owners who aren't happy until you're happy.

It was New Year's Day and my friend and I were looking for a place to watch the Rose Bowl. I called Biaggio's to make sure they'd be open and he said they'd switch the channel to whatever we wanted to watch.

When we got there, Biaggio somehow recognized me from Yelp. He knew I was the one who ended up backing out of the CMYE. Wow! For someone who claims to not be all that internet-savvy, he sure does keep a finger on the pulse of social media.

Long story short, my friend ordered an Italian Stromboli and I had a Pastrami Stromboli. We didn't realize how huge they would be, so we added some Garlic Knots for good measure. The Garlic Knots were extremely moist and doughy on the inside. And they're huge! But nowhere near as huge as the Strombolis. Even with a 3-hour game, there was no way we'd be able to eat all that food. Oh and yes, the Strombolis were all they were hyped up to be. I personally like the Pastrami over the Italian and my friend concurs. So delicious.

With our Strombolis only half eaten, the food coma was setting in and we decided to leave at half time. Biaggio stops us and says we have some Fried Dough on the way. Um. OK. How can you turn down free food from such a generous man? Of course, the Fried Dough was awesome. It's basically pizza dough topped with butter, cinnamon, and powdered sugar. It smelled really sweet, but it was surprisingly mellow. We had a few pieces and added the rest to our to-go boxes.

It goes without saying that I'll be coming back. I need to try the Chicken Wings that everyone is raving about. Also, when I mentioned that my boss loves pastrami, he offered to send us a Pastrami Stromboli when I return to work on Monday. Now that is the epitome of generosity! (I'll be sure to supplement that with my own order of Chicken Wings).

5 stars",5
108,Such a great vibe and intimate feel! Fantastic food and a lovely selection of wines!  Definitely a place that I would recommend to others!,5
109,"Today was our first trip to Zipps in Phoenix.  We used to go to the one in Scottsdale on a weekly basis, but they have been doing really bad on their health inspections.  

I ordered a beer and appetizer at 4:50.  By 5:52, we still haven't seen our server to order dinner.  I had to walk up to the bar to get another beer.  The server stopped by to take our order at 6:00.  It's 6:53 and she hasn't been back.  This will be our last trip to Zipps.",1
110,This place was awful! Tea tasted disgusting and the service was unbelievably bad. I was shocked and ended up walking out. Rude staff and bad tea= no business from me,1
111,"We went here with my in laws and had fun.  I read about this place in the Phoenix Times.  It was a lot smaller than I had imagined, but great beers and food.  I recommend the flights and the IPA as well as the jalape√±o Mac and Cheese.  Service was very helpful in making recommendations and knowledgeable about the beers and menu.",5
113,"Came here after some issues, Leo was a huge help to fixing my car, and not to mention how fast the work was done. I was very impressed by the efficient, quality work that was done here. Thanks for all the help!",5
115,"Pullman is a place you have to choose to go. It's not on the way to anywhere, and it's not close to anything else particularly. Consequently, It took me a long time to get round to going. But I loved it.

The decor is chic and comfortable, but not pretentious in any way. It attracts an eclectic clientele, with a wide range of ages. The music is present, and reasonably loud, but not so you have to shout, or even pay much attention to it (I really can't remember what was playing). It's the sort of place you can dress up to go, but at the same time, you won't feel under-dressed in jeans. (I wouldn't go in sports clothes though.) My only concern was that it is a tad on the dark side, which makes it difficult to read the tiny-printed menu when you're over 40... 

The tapas-style food offerings are top quality. I tried the gravlax, the beet and feta salad, (served together), the charcuterie platter, and the beans in truffle oil, (also served together, which made for great marriages). There was plenty for two.

I had a yen for pinot noir, but was struggling with the very long wine list. The servers are billed as sommeliers, and definitely seem to know their wines. Ours suggested one I'd been hesitating over, but it turned out to be unavailable. She offered an excellent substitute at an even better price, so we ended up having two bottles! :-)

I don't know why it took me so long to get here. I think I feared it would be pretentious and disappointing, but honestly I found it exactly the sort of place I've been looking for for a while.",5
118,"We had the tasting menu and it was a feast, we spent the next day biking to burn all the calories. 

Everything was delicious; flavourful and delicately spiced. It was an effort afterwards to try to pick a favourite, but the kibbe nayye was a contender. 

Often with a tasting menu, the dessert is an afterthought and not really worth it; so we were pleasantly surprised that the kunefa (?) a sweet cheese pastry was so good. 

Our host was second generation Syrian and was a delight, his wit and explanations added greatly to our enjoyment of the evening. Would heartily recommend this restaurant.",5
120,"I played Ocotillo a couple of years ago and it was very nice--well maintained, interesting track and nice people. I played it today and was astounded at how far the course had deteriorated. I expected some issues with Course conditions because of overseeding. But they had also ripped up all the irrigation system and there were bare spots all over the fairways. The tee boxes were beat up and the greens were bumpy and inconsistent speeds. 

All that and I still had to pay $55. I probably won't go back--too many other nice courses in the area.",1
121,Pathetic and terrible is the only way to describe my experience. Waitress was condescending and very inappropriate.  Manager finally resolved simple service issue but explained he was stepping over his superiors instructions over a simple $6.00 issue. I was disappointed to see I could not contact higher authority through Web site to share an experience that would upset any owner being a CEO myself.,1
123,"Not only is the food always delicious and fast, the employees at this location are wonderful. This past weekend I ate here and when I got home realized I had lost my keys. Not sure where I lost them, I came back to Panera (last place I remember seeing them) and three different employees helped me look around for them. When we didn't find them, two employees dug through two bags of trash just in case I threw them out. They wouldn't even accept a tip! Other employees offered other suggestions of places to look for my keys/places to go to for help. Truly great service on all fronts.",5
126,Never has been anything to rave about but in the past week I know of 3 people who have gotten sick within a couple hours of eating breakfast there.  I am calling the Health Dept in the morning.....service is always bad but getting sick is over the top and we live here....something is not right in that kitchen.,1
127,"I bought a Groupon a while back and was very excited to use it but unfortunately it expired before I had a chance to use it. I was very lucky that one of the workers came into my work and we got onto the topic of the business she works for and was super sweet to give me some passes to try them out. 

A few months later I decided to give it a try and was very happy I did. When I got inside I filled out paperwork and we got started on a consultation. The manager, Mariana, was nothing but amazing with me the whole time talking me through every step. She directed me first to the ""Hydration System"" where it steams your body for about 20 minutes. Prior to that I bought into a Stretch Mark cream to put on before, that way when the steam is opening my pores, the cream can insert and help treat my recent marks. First impression would be relaxing. After the 20 minutes, your body feels very hydrated therefore it was worth it!

Then we moved over to the Red Light Therapy where the light helps with the overall health of your skin. It penetrates and helps with fine lines, wrinkles, stretch marks, and even collagen. Although I haven't seen very much of a result quite yet, I do believe her when she says it would take multiple sessions to really improve your overall skin. 

Next I had an automated massage which was all deep tissue and at the same time was having another light therapy on my face and neck. She had me apply a cream (for my acne, which I chose) and it the light helped the cream soak into my skin. Now the day I went in, I came in with no makeup, overall redness, large pores, and tons of acne on my chin. When I woke up the next day, I noticed more than half of that was gone. I was amazed because the cream and light therapy really did improve my face a ton and I would definitely be back to do that one again. 

At the very end, we decided it would be a good idea to try a spray tan (for the first time) because the hydration station helped hydrate my skin and with that, if your skin was dry, the color wouldn't absorb properly and you would probably result patchy. It evenly distributed all over my body and next time might want to go a shade darker now that I know what to expect. 

Overall experience, Mariana was amazing and very easy to talk to through the process and I was really excited she was there to help me out and makes sure I was comfortable. I'll be back!",5
128,Very good place. Just driving by and found this place . It was very clean and elegant comparing to other ayce sushi places. They brought the food so fast and cleaned up the table (finished plate) even faster. The food is very very fresh and delicious.  Try their breaded crab meat. And salmon belly . It's super tasty. Fair price too . Nice atmosphere.  Will go back for Sure.,5
132,"Late lunch. Bar crowd and some diners in restaurant. Old fashioned ambiance but fresh and cozy. Ordered off the lunch menu linguine with calamari in marinara. Salad was tender spring greens with homemade mustard vinaigrette. Delicious and perfectly dressed. Pasta was fabulous. Linguini cooked perfect al denote, sauce fresh, basil and a touch spicy. Calamari in nice sized tubes and so tender!!  Perfection. Very pleasant staff. I will be back!",5
133,"I had barbecue mahi and beer battered fish tacos with black beans and rice. No avacado tho because I can't eat it. At any rate they were totally overstuffed totally delish, fresh and fabulous. We had a hour wait which is ok because that gave us an opportunity to walk around and get a drink. Using the phone to alert you when your table is ready lets you wander and check out and support other local businesses. Kudos to Cabo for doing this. 
Great meal and good fun and friendly atmosphere.",5
134,"Great bacon, sausage, egg and cheese croissants, and love the buttermilk donuts. Definitely one of the best donut shops in the city.",5
135,"I tried to go here, but they decided to close 45 mins earlier. I don't care, but that's not how you do business.",1
136,I love the burger and truffle fries! Fast and friendly service. The menu has a lot of healthy options as well.,5
137,"Jesse is amazing, she does beautifully skilled work for a fair price. She did a wonderful job on my cover-up and treated me so nicely.

146,"I had wanted to try Long Wong's for quite some time. Tonight was the night! We pulled in and it was busy which was expected for a Friday night. We walked in and I was overhwlemed by all of the menu items choices. 

We settled on two dozen wings (garlic parm, and some  type of spicy bbq) a mushroom burger, and a western bacon cheeseburger. The burgers were $5 each, which also included French fries. I believe our total was about $26 for all items. 

We decided to dine in and quickly grabbed a table because they were almost full. There is tons of interesting decore that reminded me that I was in a antique shop. We sat near the bathroom that is right by the front ordering counter. There is package station for leftovers which was helpful because they were busy with customers the whole time we were there. There is also hot sauce and ketchup bottles at the station, a few arcade games and a flat screen tv in the back, and a few trivia card games on a few of the tables.

The food came out to our table quickly. The wings were plump and flavorful. Finally, we found some wings that didn't skimp on the meat. The wings came with sides of ranch and carrot sticks. The burgers were awesome. The French fries were soooo tasty. I love this place and will be returning in the future. 

Recap
*Great food
*reasonable prices
*polite employees
*busy but worth it
*writing this review is making me hungry",5
147,Great experience at this UPS Store. I was visiting my folks in Vegas and had a couple of large items I needed shipped back to NC. I told them I wanted to do it as inexpensively as possible and they made it happen. Got my items today and they were beautifully packed and here on time. Thanks so much! Will recommend!,5
148,"I was at the club the other morning, grooming myself after my workout (you know, much like lions and monkeys...picking off the tic's and lice, smoothing my fur using saliva, etc.:-) and I thought to myself, ""I need a haircut:-)

BTW, if I can just digress for a moment...I see things at the club that no person should ever be subjected to...this particular morning was no different...an 85 year old, Grandpa Jones look alike, standing naked at one of the sinks, one leg up on the counter and shaving ""himself"" in places that I had trouble believing that anyone other him would care about...you just can't ""un-see"" that kind of thing:(

If that describes you...please, for the love of god...go into a shower stall or something...I was blinded from seeing this and I spent the next twenty minutes stumbling along, asking for someone to just put me out of my misery, before I managed to grope my way into a shower and boil myself:)

Anyway...I still needed a haircut...(or, I needed to reform my band from 1970...we played a very ragged version of ""House of the Rising Sun""...and that's about all we played:)

These days, my choice for sartorial reconstruction is V's Barber Shop...I used to go to Great Clips, but V's  has won me back and won me back for good:)

This location is everything I want in a great barber shop...a manly experience that simply cannot be duplicated at a ""salon"":)

Nowhere near enough testosterone in any salon...even the unisex Super Clips and Great Cut's:)

That's not the case at V's...it's all testosterone, all the time:)

The barbers are all barbers...they may be stylists too, but first and foremost, they are barbers...they know how to cut hair for men and they know how to chat with guys like the great barbers I used to frequent in San Francisco and Portland.

Lots of sports to talk about (and flat panel TV's with ESPN on at every station), plenty of magazines to read while I'm waiting for my call to action (and not a Cosmo or Vogue in sight:) and tons of wood paneling and manly smells (I mean witch hazel, talcum powder, etc....not ""pull my finger"" manly smells:)

And, most importantly, they cut my hair correctly...all of the barbers and any of the barbers at V's do a good job...they cut my hair right...as right as my poor misshapen head will allow:)

That's important to me, because (as I might have mentioned before), I'm not a ""classically handsome"" man...I'm a little bit ""quirky looking""...and a decent haircut helps:)

I'm pretty sure that a good haircut is the only thing that keeps the Beautiful Carin from second guessing herself and the (possibly drunken) decision making that led her to select me as her husband (no one ever believes that she proposed to me...I can't believe it myself...but that was a great haircut that I was sporting that day! :-)

So I'm back at V's and I'm happy to swing by and get my ""ears lowered"" (a colloquialism that I suppose is lost in the mists of time) and talk football and golf and chicks and other guy stuff with my buddies at V's:)

And if you need one, there are even post or pre-haircut cocktails available next door at the Arcadia Tavern...and believe me, sometimes quite a bit of alcohol is required to forget the horrors I've seen in the locker room at the Village:)

""Involuntary Shudder""...",5
149,"New place in Tilovi and stopped but for a glass of wine during their soft opening.  This wine bar will be my new go to place for happy hour.  They have a great staff and excited to see what happens with the space!   I love their concept of a wine bar and flower shop combined. 

This is a must see place for anyone that loves flowers and wine.",5
150,"Always great when one finds a long time local favorite and it's actually still good after several decades. This is one of those places!

History says it started as a hole in the wall and now it's a modern, simple restaurant with great pizza, sandwiches and BBQ, and still family owned. 

I tried the Pork Fry Nachos which was BBQ pork with fries and nacho cheese in a bowl. A little messy, but delicious.",5
151,"Oh my gosh, where do I start. The service is amazing and I have never waited a very long time to be seated, even when they are busy. Coffee is great and they always refill in a timely manner. Waitresses are all nice and upbeat. I always, always, always get the breakfast tacos. I am addicted to them. They are so yummy and have a ton of stuff on them! Love this place!",5
152,Please don't use this company. They steal 500 US dollar. I have to warn you before you choose this company so you don't have dissappoint trip like my experience with Papillon. They refuse to rebook or refunds and make it sounds like my own fault.,1
153,"I used Empire to install tile in my small townhouse in October 2016.. the tech, was supposed to finish the job in 3-4 days.. it took him about 10 days to finish. And when he finally did, the quality was horrible. Huge gaps and cracks in grout. When I told a supervisor about my complaints, they sent the SAME tech out to fix it.. and, surprise, surprise, he did a terrible job ""repairing"" his initial errors. Finally in December the company sent a new tech to fix my still-flawed floors. The new tech ended up having to retile the master bathroom from scratch because it wasn't laid and set properly. I was very disappointed with Empire and will not be using them in the future. I also would not recommend this company to anyone looking to purchase new floors.",1
154,"This place has a great patio and is well located near a large park, so very pleasant to sit there. The service was friendly but slow and unresponsive.

HOWEVER, the food is utterly and absolutely disgusting! Went there with my whole family for a Saturday brunch. Ordered smoked salmon eggs benedict, waffles, veggie burger, and a bunch of other stuff. It was barely edible. Eggs served on some sickeningly off colour and mushy potato roti type thing with overaged spinach. Veggie burger burns your mouth, way over-spiced. Waffles soggy on the bottom (from sucking some kind of liquid) and dried out on top. etc. etc.

Bottom line: if you go there, stick to drinks ... although they also managed to serve lemonade without ice (so lukewarm). They just don't bother putting any kind of effort with the food, probably because they know they will get customers regardless because of the patio and location alone. It would be a perfect candidate for one of those restaurant makeover shows where the TV personality yells at the chefs and owners for being lazy or incompetent.",1
155,"I traveled from Seattle and picked this place from Yelp. It was GREAT!!! I had pulled pork and hot links with mac cheese. They have many kind of bbq sauces you can try. Staff was friendly and helpful. 

You order from the counter and seek for a seat. They will call your name then enjoy it!

I'd recommend this place to anyone",5
156,Ly is my favorite! Her pedicures are the best! I'd follow her anywhere. Ask for Ly and tip well! She does great work and is so nice.,5
158,Great new spot right in the Old Town - Fashion Square Scottsdale area. It is a burger Chop House with a very unique concept. Came for the soft opening which was fantastic. Definitely will be on the hit list of normal spots. Friendly outgoing beautiful courteous staff that is here to help and explain everything. Has a cool eclectic modern but relaxed vibe.,5
159,"I ordered a pizza on the 25th of January to my address  in Twinsburg Ohio, I wanted another pizza today  and suddenly we can't get it delivered to our address because of a ""safety"" concern when it is actually a ""race"" concern. Their words: ""My drivers work minimum wage plus tips and doesn't want to risk their safety.""This is a predominantly black area and apparently we're vicious animals that prey on pizza drivers. Seeing as the Twinsburg Sheriff's department patrols this area and practically LIVES in this area. They took the money off my card and now I have to wait 24-hours to get the money back on my card. The only money I had left to feed my family. I will never do business with this pizza place ever again. I will make it known that the owner of this establishment is racist.",1
161,"One of the best dim sum restaurants I have been to.  I have searched high and low and eaten at most of the restaurants in Markham and Richmond hill and have decided there is no need to search further- this is the GO TO dim sum place.  Lots of choice.  Fresh and inventive.  Their ""small special dishes"" are great too. Compared to restaurants even in Vancouver, Richmond BC this is still my favourite.  Best baked bbq pork buns! Best egg tarts!  Best sesame ball.",5
163,"Second time to this place and I gotta say it rocks!... Literally. Their always cranking great music :-). I stumbled on the place and what a find! Not only is their selection of dogs delicious, but their staff is so cool and very friendly.

There is something for everyone here,  including veggie dogs. They also do burgers too. I suggest picking something from their list... You wont go wrong. If you catch them 3-6 they have 2 for craft beers. I find myself attracted to this place everytime I'm in the area.",5
164,"This place is awesome. I contacted them via Facebook with a tattoo idea I had. JDog brought my idea to life. Amazing work, my husband was even impressed and he is hard to impress. The shop is super clean and the artists explain where the tools come from and how the reusable part are cleaned. The guys working tonight were very cool and laid back as well as very professional and friendly. Thank you so much for your time and hospitality. Definitely would recommend and return.",5
167,"The beef was overcooked, dry, and mostly tasteless. That said, it was still ""tender"" as it was cut thin/against the grain (it is possible for meat to be both tender/dry/overcooked). I used a groupon to eat there so I wasn't too disappointed, however if I had paid full price I would have been pretty pissed. For what they charge (close to 10 bucks for a sandwich/fries/drink) it needs to be a heck of a lot better than what they serve.",1
169,"My wife and I come here once a month when the budget permits us.  Having grown up in a BBQ Restaurant in Alabama I must say this is the best BBQ West of the Mississippi!  I personally enjoy the 1/3 rack of ribs with Brisket and 2 sides. I have never been a fan of potato salad, that being said Bryan's has the most amazing potato salad I have ever had!!  The BBQ beans are also very good and a little spicy.  The best side choice for me is the Slaw!!  Ribs are always smoked to perfection here.  When we place our order we make sure to place a TOGO as well (usually always chopped brisket, 1lb.)  The prices for food are well worth it! The drive is definitely worth it! Knowing that I'll be back for more... Worth it every time!!",5
172,"OMG was this place bad! I didn't mind the 2 drink min, which is less than the cover at some clubs, but A LOT the girls have been doing this so long that 2 mentioned they've done it for 30+ years!

Never have we been ripped off by a dancer before... My new wife wanted a $20 couch lap dance, but when the dancer took her to the ""VIA room"" and even though my wife told her she didn't have money for the VIP room, the dancer said, ""don't worry, I'll take care of you"".  How did she take care of my wife??? 3 dances later ""$120, thank you""...

Do yourself a favor and go to The Hustler (best club in town) or Sapphire, you'll be glad you did.",1

186,"I will never go back to this salon again.

The salon is not clean.  I'm not sure the last time the desks and chairs have been cleaned.  

I was asked by the nail technician if I was pregnant.  I am 2 weeks post pregnancy and last I checked it's not socially acceptable to ask if someone's pregnant especially when it's not obvious.  Then she proceeded to tell me that I can buy a wrap for my stomach. 

The last and final straw was when she cut my nails super short and actually cut the skin on one of my fingers.  She was very rough and seemed like she was in a rush.  

I would have given this a salon no stars but I don't have that option.",1
187,Wow.. I am blown away by my meal here last night. The lamb noodle soup has me craving more. I am going for seconds tonight.,5
188,Very friendly host/owner and the food was delicious. Very innovative way of serving food. I had the shrimp and salmon with rice. The whole thing comes in a soda cup with your choice of soda and a bowl with the food and forms the lid for for the soda cup. It was fun and delicious . Definitely a place I would recommend and visit again.,5
189,"We had just got out of Cirque du Soleil
Looking for a place for dinner at almost 9pm. First we thought Japanese, but I'm sorry to say that after being seated for ten minutes and not being offered a drink we got up and left, then we say Osteria Costa. Although we love Italian food, we normally don't eat it out, preferring to try food we don't cook so much at home. 
What a delight Osteria Costa is! Firstly, all the staff were extremely attentive and friendly - we didn't wait more than 30 seconds before we had water and menus. Jen, our lovely waitress brought us some delicious (although a little expensive ) wine selections & explained the menu to us.
We decided to share appetizer, salad, entree & dessert 'family style'. Everything was delicious, from the creamy burrata, the crusty bread, garlicky pesto, shaved Parmesan on the arugula salad to the perfectly prepared Branzino. And not a bone in sight on the whole fish dish. We topped it off with the 'famous' olive oil cake - which was so good, not too sweet an end to a fantastically fine meal - Italian done right (not a red sauce in sight) - I'm making that olive oil cake this weekend!! Thank you",5
192,I just had two pizzas from this place. My family and I were very impressed. The sauce was homemade with hand crushed tomatoes(WOW). The owner was very friendly and chatted with me while waiting for my pizza to cook. I am looking forward to.my next visit. Steve N.,5

The waitress gave me maple syrup just in case I did not like the Tropical Syrup.  But that Tropical Syrup was so OMG tasty on my pancakes.  The host, waitress and cook was very attentive and friendly.",5
195,Very nice hotel with great service to match. I was always given a hello and help with a smile. The decorum is classier than most area spots.,5
197,"I had the strawberry shortcake mutant milkshake. I took two sips and felt such a horrible decadence that I had to stop. 

This was disappointing because i) the soft serve ice cream was low quality ii) the strawberry syrup was too sweet iii) cake was also of cheap quality. You could blend a McD's strawberry sundae with cake and get a more passable dessert, not to mention save $10. 

The decor was nice. Service took 30 min on a Wed night. I won't be coming back.",1
200,"Bernard the service attendant was extremely kind and helpful! Wow, talk about great customer service, he went above and beyond to assist me during my wait for car servicing. My service guy offered coffee and donuts during my 2 1/2 hour wait and when I told the cashier that there was no coffee, all I got was an ""okay"". Bernard came to me and offered to make me a new pot. It's the little things that count and are remembered, especially when customers are not thrilled to wait around, people like him make it a better process. Thank you Bernard.11/30/16 10:30AM",5
201,"Very good. It was extremely busy, so I thought that the service would be slow, but it wasn't. Good food-creeps are a bit thicker and heartier than I've had, but both the savory and the sweet ones were crammed full. Good decor-the place has regulars, which is a tribute to the good service and food. My only wish is that they get a ""seat yourself"" or a ""please wait to be seated sign"" and a ""take out"" sign for first timers.",5

Not only did they enter my address wrong, they called me a liar when I said I never received a call from their delivery driver.  The person I spoke with on the phone hung up on me when I asked to speak with their manager.  I went to the store to speak with their manager and she blew me off.  All in all I would not recommend this location.",1

Try the egg rolls too, can't go wrong with those.",5
207,"Back in the day, this used to be The Library. I never thought I'd say this anywhere near a college campus again, but I wish I was back at The Library, because this place sucks.

I was out milling about on Mill Ave, and while we were trying to find our next stop, we walked by the open door and empty bar. The guy at the door was enticing us with $4 Long Islands and $2 shots. I can see why....no one wants to come in here. It's lame.

You see, back when it was The Library, this place had attractive bartenders dressed as....librarians (skirts and all). A magical place, where you could have a great time. Then it started getting played out, and eventually closed.

Now, it's Blondies....it's just a run of the mill (get it?) bar with average drinks, a great location, no TV's, turrible music and a pathetic crowd. There's no theme, it's disgusting, and the ghetto crowd in the back playing Beer Pong was lame.

They didn't even have red/blue party cups. They were using cheap plastic tumblers for Beer Pong. Isn't that illegal?

I've been complaining for a while, so you are probably thinking, ""Dave, why didn't you just leave?"" The night was winding down, we were kind of tired, and we just wanted to chill. Afterall, there were plenty of places to sit, since hardly anyone was in here. 

And yes, I know it's summer and school is out. That didn't stop other places from having a crowd. Just sayin. Just sayin....

I'm most likely not coming back. Unless it's on a bar crawl, and we need a place to have another drink.",1
211,"Ate here this weekend and it was so delicious. I will definitely be going back. I ordered the Volcano and it came with three pancakes, two eggs, two sausage and two bacon. The food was not greasy like other places in the area that have good reviews, but no so good food. The prices were great for all of the food we got. Definitely will be back sometime!",5
213,"A rare find in LV: good food, inexpensive.  Wives had the lobster and steak spedial $13.  I had the prime rib $14.  Friend had the strip steak $14.

I love the retro decor, the food is amazing (green enchiladas, all rice, no garnish, and a flour tortilla is the way to go), the drinks are tasty (and cheap, especially to an LA girl), and the staff is friendly.  I would recommend to anyone looking for delish Mexican food in the valley!",5

Arrived at this location at 6:45, and was happy to see a sign on the door that  says ""walk-in appointment welcomed"" huh... what a lie. I sat for 45 minutes while other people, who didn't have appointments were taken in front of me with no explanation or anything of why I had to wait. When I got up and walked out the girl just looked at me and said nothing. I will never do business with this establishment and I will make sure that everyone I know, knows what kind of place this is.",1

219,"I went in last year to get a tuneup and fix a flat.

afterwards my bike derailleur system was messed up, skipping and changing gears, so went back, spent some cash on replacement parts, it got worse, went back again, spent more cash, still the same, but now had spent $350+ on to fix a flat a tuneup and bike was in WORSE condition then when I started

went back again end of 2013 with third complaint, after arguing that it wasn't me or the way the bike was made (NEVER had these issues before they did the tuneup) they made some adjustments, was better but not perfect

took my bike out this spring, the bike derailleur behaves like a piece of cr@&, on downhills and up hills or whenever there is lots of torque, derailleur again constantly skips, jumps, misses gears causing horrible cycling conditions... and the light i also bought the first time broke with button just falling off, useless...

i always try to have nothing but positive reviews, but I just have to warn others about this place, i've never spent 30% of value of an asset on repairs and had it come back in worse condition.. beware",1

Don't even bother looking at the menu, order this gem. You won't be disappointed in the slightest. When I first arrived and had seen the reviews, I was tempted to try the tacos or burger. Uh, no. The chopped salad is where it's at and rightfully how The Gladly has its fame. Ask the wait staff to mix it for you and you'll see just how intricately the ingredients blend together. Every piece is crucial to the overall taste. I recommend ordering it with avocado as that definitely livens things up, but I'm sure it would be fine on its own too.

Oh, and they also serve a great Arnold Palmer ;)",5
233,"THESE ""WOMEN"" BELONG IN JAIL!! I went in to ask for my money back, they charged me for the same service twice (which was never provided).  Practically the first words out of the owner were, ""call 911.""  Yea....I was overcharged, asked for my money back, and have been being harassed from this company ever since!  They are claiming that I am lying about how many times I have even been there!  When in fact, their own stylists are lying about how many times they have done=screwed up my hair and are reporting it differently (OR NOT AT ALL) in their computers!  The first stylist I saw there was LENA=bad haircut!  I came in for it to be fixed by the most experienced person they had, which is what I had requested initially but they decided to give me Lena, with only 3 yrs experience.  After most experienced Sarah had fixed my haircut, I decided to let Sarah do another cut and also dye my hair.  BAD CHOICE!  I would have never had SARAH do my cut or dye again after the first screw up but instead of just giving me my money back like I requested they insisted on fixing it!  And, she did so again the 2nd time, and again the 3rd time!  She is the teacher there, so this is why I allowed it to be her to try to fix it instead of obviously going with a different stylist but since Sarah is the teacher there I figured I was getting the best they had to offer...YIKES!!!  I am obviously the idiot for assuming they actually knew how to do hair in any way at this salon...I take responsibility for being the idiot (I'M TOO NICE!) for allowing them to push me around instead of just refunding my money like I requested the first, second, and third times.  BUT NOW, THEY TOOK IT TOO FAR!  THEY ARE STEALING MY $210, NEVER PROVIDED THE SERVICE THEY HAVE NOW CHARGED ME TWICE FOR AND ON TOP OF THAT THEY ARE THREATENING ME WITH LAWSUITS AND WASTING TAXPAYERS' MONEY CALLING 911 FOR NO REASON OTHER THAN TO COVER UP THEIR OWN UGLY BUSINESS PRACTICES!  SECRETS HAIR SALON IS HORRIBLLE!!!!!!  I actually have it all written down in my calendar (& on my head:() (however, not one of these ""women"" will even listen to or try to help me-instead they just called 911!  The manager, Luann, (with the full support of her owner=evil!) threatened me on a voicemail that they would attempt to get their lawyers involved because I left a comment on Facebook so others will know that these ""women"" will NOT only screw up your hair and steal your money afterward, they are threatening your civil rights!!!!!  Freedom of speech, honesty, & integrity do not even exist in this salon!  And, they actually did call the cops on me and I had to talk to 2 cops when I showed up just for proof of where in their computers it says I have only seen Sarah 2 times!  When I have in reality seen her 4 times!!!!!!!!!!! 1 fix haircut after LENA originally screwed it up + 3 bad haircuts/dye jobs!  HERE R THE DATES: 2/12: bad haircut and dye job (from SARAH), 2/19 SARAH was supposed to fix instead yet another bad haircut and dye job from SARAH, 4/12 SARAH was supposed to fix but received yet another bad haircut & dye job from SARAH!  Of course I was charged the $100 ($65 dye + $35 cut) the first time Sarah did cut and dye (2/12), BUT for some reason she charged me another $110 (dye + cut + $10 gloss) on 4/12, but that was supposed to FIX the crap cut and color she had given me the first and second times!  NOW, THE TOP HALF OF MY HEAD IS BRASSY ORANGE WITH BRIGHT NEON YELLOW PATCHES/HIGHLIGHTS :( & THE REST OF MY HAIR IS AN UGLY ORANGE BROWN :(:(:(  I USED TO RECEIVE COMPLIMENTS ON MY HAIR EVERYWHERE I WENT UNTIL I STARTED COMING TO THIS SALON, NOW EVERYONE I SEE SAYS ""IT'S NOT TOOOO BAD:(""  I have seriously gotten the exact same haircut at Great Clips & Wal-Mart!!!!  Save your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  And your sanity!  They leave voicemails on my phone 10 times in a row after 7 pm, harass me, threaten me, call the cops on me, try to have me arrested for trespassing when I show up to their business both to explain how they are mistaken and for proof of the fallacies they are spuing, but they all just want to be THIEVING LIARS and not help anyone but themselves :(  Secrets Hair Salon is BOTCHED!!!!!!!!!!!",1
235,"Astonishingly Mediocre 

Alas, this experience was everything I dislike about corporate restaurants--unenthusiastic employees following a script, slow and incompetent service, uninspiring food.

While I understand that a party of 9 is a large group, the restaurant wasn't busy during our time there at lunch, and there seemed to be no cross service to help out our waitperson.  Despite being perhaps 30% full, our lunches took about 25 minutes to deliver.  And the order was incomplete, one entree was incorrect, one not delivered at all.  Too bad it was wings, as it took another 20 minutes for them to arrive--and these too were incorrect.  I guess other than being part of the name, wings are a difficult entree to prepare.

The waitperson apologized, then started complaining about the kitchen staff--true professionalism.  The head host (who introduced herself as we sat and left a flyer with us) never came by to apologize.

Despite us being obviously ready to go after over an hour there, the waitperson had to go back and finalize the bill, which was incorrect.  We were charged for the delayed (and incorrect wings), but were not charged for the incorrect salad entree.  That would somewhat make sense, but it was not mentioned by the waitperson, so I don't know if it was a mistake or intentionally complimentary.

My entree was entirely forgettable (indeed, a few days later I have no recollection of what it was).  I do recall that the onion rings were soggy and greasy.

The two word review:  Why Bother?",1

The meat was well seasoned and very flavorful.  The customer service was excellent as well.  As soon as I flipped the tag over for food, it was like they all came rushing at me with bbq'd meat on skewers.  I was treated like a king and ate like a hungry peasant.  gyeah.",5

245,"I came to Las Vegas in March looking for a place for my husband and I to live. 
Debbie Bird {Real Estate agent} showed me the property at Bella Vista. When I first saw it I really liked it because the appliance matched. It was enough room for My husband and I and our 2 pets. 
I immediately got everything in motion so I could go back east and pack. I gave myself 3 days to find a place. I went into Remax Central on Sahara
and met Tobie. Tobie went over the lease. I told her my husband and cat will come later has he was finishing up things back east. The rent was 
$699. I paid a pet deposit of $300 for my Pom among other fees. I told Tobie  my husband and cat will be here later on in the year. She said as soon as they get here we will have to pay another pet deposit for the cat. No problem. Tobie and I agreed on that. I left Las Vegas with the lease stating $699 a month. I signed a year lease. Gave money for a year lease. 
I signed the lease in March. I did not move in until May18.  
In the middle of April I get an email from someone name Laurine Huynh from Remax Central stating that I will have to pay for my cat before I get there. I wrote back and told her Tobie and I agreed that when my husband and cat get to Las Vegas just come into Remax and pay another pet deposit.
Laurine Huynh Very Nasty person said Tobie is not a leasing agent she filled in for her because she was on pregnancy leave. I said well how was I suppose to know what position Tobie is and did not know who  Laurine is. I have never heard of you.
First I thought it was a scam. So I wrote Tobie she said Laurine is the leasing manager. I talked to Laurine and told her Tobie and I had an agreement I signed a lease with Tobie not with you. I also stated to her so everything Tobie said was a lie? Her words were that's not what I am saying. I said yes it is because if it was not then why are you telling me something totally different from what tobie and i discussed in March and a lease i already signed.
I left Las Vegas thinking the rent was $699.
It changed to I had to pay for my cat deposit right at that moment even though I did not know when my husband and cat would be here.  Another fee came up $50 extra a month for my husband and cat. I said for my husband and cat are you kidding me. She wrote back and said: 
Because you are adding extra people. What?? extra people? How is my husband an extra person. This is a 2 bedroom 1 bath condo.On the application said will except pets 2 maximum. I had already agreed to pay a security deposit for my cat even though I did not know when they would be there. Then another total came up. She said I would have to pay extra $75 for an extra inspection. WHAT!!!??? The lease I signed with Tobie already said it was going to be inspection every 3 months. Which was no extra money to me. So I have to pay for extra inspection for what month? They were already going to inspect it every 3 months so basically she was trying to make me pay for inspection that was already in the lease.
JOHN and RUTH AHLBRAND is the owner of that Remax on 8400 W Sahara so i received in my email something that wanted me to give them my automatic signature
I never signed that. But i did sign for extra fee for $50 more a month for rent for as they sated: EXTRA PEOPLE. I could have said NO but that would have meant i would have to come back to Las Vegas and start over. Laurine even said i could pay the extra $50 for the whole year if i wanted to. I said NO. I will pay it monthly.
They already had a year worth of rent from me and now they were going to have $50 more a month for my husband and cat. They thought they was going to get that $75 for an extra inspection which i fought NOT to give. 
When i got here in May2014 the air condition was broke. I spent 3 hot days in that apartment. I have high blood pressure, heart failure and i am disabled. The microwave was filthy underneath. The refrigerator was not cold. They had to replace all of that. She talked about me paying for that old nasty microwave. But they realized it was old and nasty underneath the vent. I guess i was so relieved to get a place {I was only in town for 3 days} i really did not look underneath the microwave.
Derek the repair man {extremely nice} had to replace the bulb in the stove. When he pulled the stove out OMG there was dog food, dirt, a dog toyand a lot of food crumbs. 
Everything was wrong got fixed or replaced but not without the attitude of Re/max.
I never hung anything on the walls while we lived there. I did not want them try and nickle and dime us when we moved which was this year. Long year in that apartment. We hired Maria House Cleaning service to clean and that place looked cleaner after we left than before. The stove had so many marks on it i thought it was part of the stove being everything was old except of the cabinets. The cabinets were changed over in all the apartments when they changed to condos. 
Beware they will nickle and dime you.",1
247,"OK, where do I start? Oh yes, the reservation. Called in a reservation for a company dinner this Sunday for last night which never hit the books. So our party including execs had to sit at the 'community table' which my manager was not excited about, thanks, Vig.

Flash back to the valet, the parking entrance is confusing and I took an unintentional detour and then had to flag someone down after 10 minutes because they were completely ignoring me. They said they had to help the people in line, but I had been there before any of the cars arrived.

Next, the waitress disappeared for twenty minutes after taking most of the drinks sans three people. So three people were drinkless for half an hour while everyone else had their 'adult beverages'. The woman who ordered wine, (me of course), had to wait an additional 15 minutes because they were 'checking to see if they had it'.

My burger ordered medium rare was charred to a crisp that couldn't even be drowned out by the Secret Sauce. Saving grace -- the fries were good, yay.

Also, who thought that putting chipotle in everything on the menu was a good idea? Not thrilled, not going back and certainly not recommending this for any corporate or group outings.Really disappointed, I've always heard good things about The Vig and enjoyed going to the bar there.",1

There is nothing I love better than quiche and salad for lunch and theirs is fabulous, with fluffy quiche and a wonderful, fresh salad. The French toast is amazing, and my husband loved his omelet so much that he ate every bite, saying that it was the best omelet he's ever eaten. While a previous reviewer described the omelet as ""surprisingly small given the price,"" we thought it was a perfect size for healthy eating.

251,"Remember what Eau Claire used to be like? It was a bustling community space with artists, musicians and a diverse community of people enjoying their day. Cafe Blanca reignites this community focus in the Eau Claire Area - this time, with a focus on Coffee.

They love coffee. They love coffee more than you love coffee. You might have thought you loved coffee, but they take it to a level that honestly, you probably won't every care to know. This is good, because the result of which for your average coffee loving Joe, is a very delicious cup of joe.

There's a few kind of seating arrangements, whether you're looking for a quick bite or looking to get social with some friends, a date, and interview, or cozy up and get social online with your email in a corner somewhere. It's a good space if you need some focus time because it's somewhat quiet right now, but it's really quite great so if this review has anything to do with it, I hope to see a little more bustle in the near future. :)

If you're looking at staying even a little longer there's a detached back room complete with TV if you wanted to host a large meeting, or some boardgames if you feel like hanging out next to the sunny windows.

The food is fresh tasting and quite healthy. As coffee shops become a big part of my work day, it's nice to be able to find a meal that is both tastes good and is healthy at the same time.

More importantly, the quality of the work they all did was outstanding. They are ""artists"". We now have the best looking house in the neighborhood. Many thanks to George and the gang!",5
265,"For the love of PETE MOVE HERE TO MY TOWN!

OMG! the food here was to die for. I have never had brisket like this! I mean really NEVER! I did not expect much and when I got my sandwich I was in SHOCK! I mean really it was like I was in HEAVEN! Service was nice and friendly and the food was just hot and fresh!!

The brisket was way way cool. I want to give this place a 10. This place made the visit all worth it. Thank god I found this place. I will come here every time! BEST FOOD BBQ FOOD EVER!!!!


COME HERE NOW Its that good!

GREAT JOB GUYS AND GALS!",5
266,This was my first visit at this location and I had a great experience. It was recommended to me by my hair salon since I was looking for a new hair dryer. I was greeted right as I walked in and as I stood staring at the large selection someone quickly came to see if I needed any help. They were very knowledgeable and I have been very happy with the one they helped me select! Great products and great service. Thanks!,5
270,I was in town for business and needed to find a local restaurant. My coworkers and I choose Little Italy on Mayfield. After several drinks and good laughs we were treated to an amazing dinner that was cooked to perfection. Met the owner who made us feel like family. Thank you for a lovely evening. Will visit again when in the area.,5
272,"My first trip to the Mirage was a great one! The hotel and casino are beautiful and fairly easy to navigate (which is saying something for Vegas which has famously confusing casino floors). We had an excellent experience with the front desk staff - Luis was extremely professional and helpful for us in securing our room upgrade. Our room was amazing and the housekeeping staff did a great job. 

There is a lot to do on site at the Mirage. The Mirage volcano (which underwent a $25 million upgrade I believe) was brand new to us on this trip - the past times we had been it was under construction. Definitely do not miss this! The pool at the Mirage was awesome although nothing too different from most resort pools I have been to. The Paradise Cafe (located by the pool) had great service and food. 

It's not advertised but the Sigfried and Roy Tiger Habitat offers a $3 per ticket discount to Mirage hotel guests if you show your room key. We gladly took advantage of this and enjoyed seeing all the animals. 

The Beatles Revolution lounge (located just off the casino) has a really cool ambiance and atmosphere, but $9 for a Heineken bottle is a bit excessive. We loved the Beatles Love Cirque du Soleil gift shop - sadly we could not get tickets for the show, so we spent a good amount of money in the gift shop buying souvenirs instead.

One downside to staying at the Mirage is the $20/day resort fee and additional tax that is charged not only on the room but the resort fee as well. To their credit, they are up front about the resort fee - it was NOT hidden, we were well aware of its existence before we booked our room.",5
275,BEST SERVICE EVER! Literally if you don't come here you're crazy. Kai is the absolute QUEEN and so sweet & very funny. Sung my heart out with him lol so amazing. If I could give 10000 stars i would. Stop by and get lashed by the one and only LASHDADDY,5
276,"First time to hot n juicy from 3 years living here and don't know why we waited so long!! Compared to the other crawfish restaurants..this place is my favorite!! Got medium lemon pepper shrimp, corn, potato & sausage and was totally an amazing choice!! It was soooo good!! Had jessica & Rick as servers and they made the experience fun, energetic & making us wanna come back tomorrow!! What topped it off compared to the other places was that they give you gloves to use (I have a cut on my finger so didn't want to get the sauce on it) and they have sinks outside the bathroom to wash your hands! Oh AND the whole ambiance and feel of this location I LOVEEE!! It's interior design was so nice and clean and the fact that it wasn't busy made the experience so relaxing while we ate!! Thanks for coming to this side!! See you tomorrow :)",5
277,This is the worst Taco Bell I have ever been to. I asked for sauce at the drive thru and she threw one sauce in my bag. Which was super rude. Then I got home and we were missing one of the burritos which we paid for. We called and the same girl who was working the drive thru answered. Her name is Dori and she claimed to be the manager and refused to tell us who is above her and was incredibly unprofessional and rude over the phone. She in no way compensated for our troubles. To top it all of I found a piece of plastic in my burrito. Never going here again. Worst experience ever.,1
279,"If -5 Stars was possible, I would do so. What a Terrible experience with this dealership in particular we had. After several broken promises/lies it's come down to  There general fiance manager (JT) disregarding us. What a shame, I would look elsewhere for a different dealership.",1
280,"The hotel rooms are a bit cheaper than its competitors considering the quality of room that you get.

I've stayed in the Deluxe Suite, corner Business Suite (Rm 6002) and Vdara Suite (Rm 43010).

The Business Suite and Vdara Suite are basically the same except that the view from the business suite that we were in was the Aria Shuttle (looks like the Disneyland monorail). The view at our Vdara Suite was pretty nice, we could see the strip, including the bellagio water show.

List of things that impressed me:
- kitchen sink/stove/cabinetry
- separate door for the bedroom
- pull out sofa, dining table
- full sized stainless steel refrigerator
- electronic blackout curtains/shades
- washer/dryer set
- bathtub
- 2 free water bottles per night

List of things we needed to call for:
- extra towels
- setting up the pullout sofa
- detergent
- pots/pans/cookware
- extra soap

Convenience Store
The walk to the nearest convenience store is a few minutes away. Around the roundabout to Aria and through Aria's entrance, you'll immediate see ""Elements"" which is Aria's 24/hr convenience store.

Cosmopolitan
We found that walking outside alongside cosmopolitan was the quickest way to get there. It beats walking through Aria, then the mall, then over the bridge.

Earl of Sandwiches
Again, walking right alongside the Cosmopolitan hotel was the quickest way to get to Earl of Sandwiches.

Planet Hollywood vs Vdara - Go Vdara
If your decision is to either stay at Planet Hollywood or Vdara, I would probably stay at Vdara based on the quality of the room that you get for the price. No, it doesnt have a casino, but think of that as a good thing, for most.

Customer Service
The front desk was extremely attentive to our needs. Housekeeping was fairly quick, with the exception of check-in times. Make sure to request that your sofa bed get done when the sun is down, you'll get a lot quicker service this way. Be nice to your housekeeping lady that fixes up your room because most likely, she'll be the one fixing up your room the next day as well, tip her the first day at minimum.

Late Night Munchies
Sorry, no late night munchies at Vdara except for room service, you'll have to walk to Aria for that.

Cafe Downstairs
The food takes about 20 minutes to get, so you'll have to be patient. Luckily, I was working on my laptop using my tethered internet, so it was a pleasant time while I was there.

Free Wifi (512kbps included)
Don't expect fast internet, it's slow, for free. Fast if you pay? I'm not sure, I didn't rely on their internet, I just tethered.

AT&T iPhone 5 Reception
The reception is good when you're on the lower floors. I had LTE on the lower floors. However, up on the 43rd floor, it took forever for pages to load while browsing. Reception was also a bit choppy for the people I was talking to on the phone. It's not the hotel's fault, it's just that I was too high up.

Pool
Don't expect much, it's a little pool with a bunch of seats to lay down on. They provide towels. They check your room key before letting you enter. There's a large rectangular spa as well. The music is ok, could be louder and more modern selection.

In short, my stay was great.",5
282,Unfortunately this location has terrible customer service they cannot take in order to save their life even when you do it online and you're giving them an order in black-and-white every time I order I always get a different order it's too bad I don't have enough time for them to correct the mistakes.,1
285,"We gave them another try. This time at 9pm for dessert. We wanted to play some music and requested some change and was told the juke box system does not work. The guy went on to tell us they just run a Pandora list with some crappy old music on it. My friend asked of they still dance and was told, ""No we don't dance, we are a franchise not a real Johnny Rockets.",1
287,Potstickers are excellent! Enjoyed everything I ordered. Great service-- attentive and helpful! Able to accommodate bigger party last minute graciously without compromising on quality of experience. Would recommend to anyone in the area!,5
290,Best breakfast place in vegas. I'm a local and I always recommend this place to any of my friends coming from out of town. Their skillets are my absolute favorite but I have tried their omelette and it is also tasty. Service is great if you need something just flip the egg to a sad face and anyone around will come see what you need.,5
291,"My wife and I went to this place to purchase some magazines for a rifle. My wife decided to shoot some full-auto assault rifles which we can't do in Cali. They gave us a good deal we had an awesome experience. They offered us a ride back to our hotel. Good to know that they could've picked us up too. 
Great Experience
Prices
Staff 
Will definitely come back.",5
294,"Most people in Cleveland are acquainted with Aladdin's for a quick lunch or dinner of Lebanese food. However, if you're looking for a nicer dinner with a great atmosphere Taza's is your place. They make their own fresh pita, playfully names ""puffy pita"" by some, served with olive oil and zataar. I'd highly recommend ordering any of the meat products as they are each grilled to perfection on what must be a wood fire grill. 

My favorite plate is the Lamb Plate that can be ordered in two sizes, depending how much meat you want (I recommend eating it with the garlic sauce). The perfect wine pairing is the red Adyar wine. This wine is made in Lebanon and can only be found at Taza's or Aladdin's",5
295,First time customer back about 1 month ago and made return few weeks later after Smerling did an excellent job with my fade. He is true pro and worked his magic and now he has me as customer.  Overall the shop is small but cool spot everyone is nice & friendly.  I highly recommend this shop & Smerling.,5
297,Beautiful place. Didn't have any reservations and they sat us pretty quick. I ordered the Diver Sea Scallops. They were DELICIOUS!!!!!!! The staff was super friendly and constantly checking up on us. The manager came up to us to make sure everything was great. He was super nice! The mashed potatoes and asparagus were quite delicious. I will definitely be back here again. Loved everything about this place from the front desk staff to everyone here at the restaurant. It was just good vibes all around. This place made me smile constantly lol. Thank you!!!,5
298,"After sitting at the table the hostess directed us to, we got up after 10 minutes of no menus or anyone acknowledging us. Oh, but the hostess did come over to see if there was money on the table after the last group left. She even had the gall to say ""Have a good day"" as we left. Won't be back to DeLucas. Luckily, Pamela's is around the corner.",1
299,"I really loved going to HAUS when it was in Biltmore but now that it is in the Camelback/Central plaza, it is way more convenient for me to go and look at stuff that I can't afford.  

I love their baby section.  If we ever decided to have a kid, we would totally register for everything they have here.  Just an amazing selection of stuff.

Their kitchen items are all really cool but so pricey.  $40 for a single ice cream dish?  Wow!  Not today.

This place is a really good place to find gifts for people.  Not everything is expensive but most of the furniture is and it is too bad because I really want all of it.",5
300,"The inside has a putrid smell similar to an unclean public bathroom, the floor is stained, practically a hangout for homeless people, and extremely uncomfortable overall. Would not recommend.",1
306,"Love this place, it's a cute little family owned and run cafe with amazing food, and great customer service! If you're in the area give it a try, you won't regret it!",5
307,"My friend and I were visiting Toronto this past weekend, and after a long day of walking around the city we decided to grab some sushi to snack on before heading back to the hotel to rest and get ready for proper dinner.

We settled on Kokyo after passing by a couple other restaurants. A very nice waitress greeted us at the front door and we were seated in the outdoor patio area. The plastic lawn chairs were scuffed and old looking. There was duct tape around the outer edge of all the tables. To hide chips and cracks? Who knows. 

We ordered 4 rolls: Spicy Tuna with tempura flakes; Cucumber; Salmon; and Honolulu. The prices were pretty cheap compared to the sushi place we frequent in our hometown, so we thought we were getting a deal. 

When the rolls came out my first thought was: Holy sh*t I hope we don't get food poisoning from this. I don't know if it was the chef's first day out of school or what, but they were the sloppiest looking rolls we've ever seen. They looked like they were falling apart. And the pieces were sliced so huge, it was almost impossible to eat them in one bite. You could either try to shove the whole thing in your mouth and hope you could chew it enough to swallow, or try to take two bites, which effectively destroyed the piece and made a mess. I settled on taking two bites each, dealing with the mess to avoid choking.

As for the taste, it was MEH. We are really spoiled when it comes to sushi, our local sushi place consistently puts out exceptional food. The cucumber roll was just a (huge) chunk of cuke surrounded by rice, so it's hard to go wrong there. The Honolulu roll was good, but the avocado had some brown spots on it. The Spicy Tuna roll tasted just the slightest bit off. It looked fairly unappetizing, which probably colored our opinion. I liked the texture of the tempura flakes though. The Salmon roll was also ok. We left several pieces on the plate. We just didn't want to finish them.

Thoughout dinner there was one particularly agressive fly that would not leave me alone, and little birds hopping around the patio. Not very relaxing when you're trying to eat. Overall, I would say skip this place. I'm sure you can do better.",1
308,"Went there for breakfast, nothing special... not much choice for people who dont like eggs....",1
309,"Such good quality sushi, in such a nice intimate quiet setting! Also great service and food is delicious!!!!",5
311,"My adult kids, husband and I came to this business because were referred by a friend.  I explained to the manager Shelly and another employee that we were under a major time restraint.  After telling them our background and situation they said we were ""solid renters"" and wouldn't have any trouble finding us a place.  
The employee seemed very disorganized and showed us one place after being there for almost half a day. He said he would call the next day with other places to show us.  I never received a call back so I called the manager explaining to her our time constraint and asked for a more aggressive person.  She had nothing but excuses and sounded like she just wanted to get me off the phone before stating that she would check my file and call back.  I have yet to receive that call.

If you're in any kind of hurry or expect organization and timely call backs, this is NOT the place to go.",1
313,"I purchased an Amazon Local deal for a 3 hr cleaning, and shortly before it expired, I called to schedule the cleaning. Since the coupon was set to expire in 3 days, Linda was unwilling to honor the coupon value because the actual service was set to take place after the expiration date. I have had all other companies honor the promotional value if the service was scheduled prior to the expiration date, however Linda was completely unwilling to show any flexibility on this, and only agreed to provide 1 hr of service, as required for the $49 I paid for the coupon. Her reasoning was ""policy,"" however as the owner of her own company, that excuse does not carry much weight, as she has the authority to do as she pleases and she obviously chose not to be flexible here. She maintained a pleasant tone throughout our conversation, however the entire interaction left me feeling very frustrated. I will not be using her services at all for future cleaning due to this experience.",1
315,"This place came highly recommend by some local friends when we were visiting, and YES. The place was perfect for our Sunday brunch as we were leaving town. Our waiter was extremely nice, funny and attentive. The menu is straight forward- MEATBALLS. They have quite a variety to satisfy everyone in a group. Can't wait to come back on my next trip to PGH, hopefully for dinner next time so I can try some craft cocktails. 

Did I mention how amazing the decor is?",5
316,"I went to this place for a few months and quit taking my 2.5 year old there because that place is more concerned about money than helping with the care of your child. Tami is very difficult to deal with and even after months of going there she was never nice or willing to work with me and my husband's inconsistant schedules. I was overcharged on multiple occasions. My son didn't learn anything from this place, the place is a rip off!",1
317,"I recently brought my 1999 Jeep Wrangler in to have some chronic oil leaks repaired. These engines are notorious for rear main seal leaks. The guys did a great job repairing the issue. A month later and No more leaks!  The guys also addressed a few other minor issues and tightened a few loose bolts.  Good service, professional and fair price. I highly recommend.",5
318,"Interesting decor, colorful, clean.  It had been about 40 years since we ate at OSF.  Staff are efficient, friendly and reasonably attentive but the food is not good.  It has nothing to do with the chef but probably the recipes.  Not good flavors, not what you would expect from traditional plates you have eaten elsewhere.  We had Lasagna, poor or lack of flavor and Chicken Alfredo almost tasteless and the chicken was grisly. I did well to have eaten a third of it because I was extremely hungry!  Lots of salt and pepper couldn't pick it up.  I will never return, there are too many good places to eat here in the Phoenix area.",1
319,This is a great place to eat. Fast courteous service. The entire staff is very polite and reservations are recommended as it seems to be very full when I've been there.,5
322,"I think I found one thing Indiana has to offer ,this park is beautiful! With  all the trees I feel this is a place that you can hike in the dead of summer",5
323,"Great food, reasonable prices, good service.  Crawfish and shrimp by the pound.  Three sauces (as I recall) with three heat levels for each.  I had the signature ""Hot & Juicy"" sauce, but got mild because I was not alone.  On my own I'd probably get medium.  Great flavor.  Be ready to get messy.  They provide paper towels and bibs...you'll need them.

This is on my list anytime I return to Vegas.",5
324,Perfect!! I put off ordering cupcakes and had to find a spot last min. These girls were so helpful with my late order. Turned out so cute too!!,5

After I confirmed I'd like to go ahead and contract with them for this case they became impossible to speak with.

I can't speak on the services provided because they never returned any phone calls or emails.",1
327,"This is a vegan place that I love. I didn't think it was going to be good but I was pleasantly surprised. I decide that the holy moly looked good and I really wanted to eat something healthy. The chicken holy moly comes with black beans, rice, salad, and tortillas. The tortilla taste homemade and they are so good the black beans and rice are also very delicious. I absolutely love the holy moly and I recommend it. The place is really cute and trendy and the staff is really nice and it's a great experience.",5

Came by with friends ordered a Basil Chicken Panini and a Rose Macaron! Excellent taste and awesome employees who were very friendly and gave us great service! I can't wait to stop by on my next visit to Vegas!,5
335,"DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!

I'm writing this as I sit, extremely grossed out in my hotel room here at the travelodge. 

We checked in on Monday evening where our room seemed fine enough for what we paid. Sure it isn't the cleanest but for $30 something dollars a night you can't be too picky. We unpacked everything that we had for our seven night stay, when we realized there was no key to our in room safe. We called the front desk and they offered to move us right then. We moved to a room two doors down and packed and unpacked all of our things yet again. The next day, we found a small cockroach in the bathroom and a few moments later, a very large cockroach climbing up the wall above our bed. We went down to the front desk to show them what we just came across and they didn't even bat an eye.... That was extremely disturbing to me, that both women working did not seem the least bit alarmed at the sight of two cockroaches found in their hotel!!! They offered us yet another room but we were on our way out to a pool party and we're already running late. So we moved to our third room later that evening. Packed up all of our things again and moved them all upstairs.. We got through the next day without a cockroach sighting in our new room, up until just now! I went into the bathroom and there was a giant one sitting on my tooth brush!!!!!! I would be leaving but it's an extremely busy weekend here in vegas and everything is either booked or too pricey! Each time I try to contact a manager about our ongoing issue, she 'isn't in'. Very disappointed in spending my vacation here, it has been a headache and a disaster. 

Save yourself the trouble and pick somewhere else!!! 
I've had a good experience at circus circus manor lodge which is not too much more expensive!!",1
337,$15 8oz filet on Sundays. Albert was our AMAZING bartender! The Pear-fection and Chocolate martinis were Delicious! Great friendly service! Machines hit!! I will be back!,5
338,"If I could give zero stars I would. I wonder if the people making the decisions try sleeping here. The beds are uncomfortable, the pillows are worse, the walls are so thin I can literally hear the people above us chewing gum. I asked for an accessible room, she said it was a king suite, only the bed was a miniature double, certainly not big enough for two people and the only thing that made it accessible was a hand-held shower head. I called to ask for a different room and the phone doesn't work. Although it's a suite there are no glasses. It's 9am and 20 degrees but the guy is skimming the pool, not only that he's singing and I can hear him as if he's standing next to me. If I wasn't getting up to be gone until after midnight we'd be changing hotels. It also appears that people live here for some have a lot of crap in the windows as if they have been here awhile.",1
339,"I have had 2 fabulous experiences with Dr Hart and her staff. The first was for a bonding repair in August and the second was for an x-ray review before my teeth cleaning in November.  The equipment is modern and they walk you through the whole process. The office is clean and comfortable. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  My dental hygienist was very thorough and explained the whole process. They give you an estimated statement that you sign before completing any procedure-taking the guess work out completely. Really, the whole staff is very pleasant and I enjoy going there very much.",5
340,"The food is good but not worth the bad service when they get your order wrong. My order was wrong & instead of being apologetic & replacing it, they only replaced half the order.  After waiting 45min for the driver.  I called back & requested my money back.  Once the driver arrived he told me i would either get a refund or my food not both also was very rude about it.  It was only after convincing him to call the manager who approved the refund, he said very rudely ""here's your $9"". And took off.  Only visit this poor excuse of a food joint if you want rude service if THEY mess up your order.",1
341,"How can you not give Total Wine 5 stars?! Outside of Yelp I have heard from friend's ( I don't really like them) complaining; muttering something to the effect of ""it's not that impressive"". Are you f$&king serious?! Where else can you find the selection AND at great prices without having to be jerked around into getting a club card?! Where else can you find as many craft brews from all over?! Organic Vodka? Yes! They have always had every brand I have gone there in search of(even the elusive Christiana Vodka which I have never seen ANYWHERE else for purchase)! 

Ok,enough with the questions marks and exclamation points, the facts are they have the biggest selection and the best prices. They blow Bev Mo and Costco out of the water. People always ask me if it's REALLY cheaper then Costco, well it is....... consistently(plus you have to drop $50 just to shop at Costco). 

We usually hit the Desert Ridge location(that was my first intro), but have been hitting this new Camelback location in CenPho and we like it. It's a good spot and it's probably the only store that sells alcohol that you could spend over an hour in giggling like a child. 

Enjoy responsibly.",5
342,"I really enjoyed my experience with Lola Lash Bar Mckenzie Towne. This was my first time getting my eyelashes done and i couldn't have asked for better experience. 

The atmosphere is really girly, chic and sophisticated. Think: a Lauren Conrad blog post that came to life. 

The technician that did my lashes was super friendly and checked up on me throughout the process. Which is about 3 hours from start to finish for a new set. 

They are really attuned with beauty trends and I didn't have to explain what I was looking for--what was in style and I didn't have to explain myself.

I got the 15s and the end lashes flared out for the ""doll eye"" looked. I loved it! And it lasted a long time-- like 3 weeks by following the proper care instructions.

I was offered the gel pack but it's not necessary but do invest in a spoolie!

I loved my experience so much that this is my go-to lash place.",5
344,"I normally love it here, have the frequent stamp card and all. Came in one afternoon and the service was terrible. Will never return about 20-24 minutes between rolls and we watched every table get help while we sat just looking around from the corner. And the ladies came and took our order like 3 times. I guess they just didn't put it in. And my mochi was melted asked for another and they brought me another melted. My new place is Sumo Sushi the lunch is $3 cheaper than here anyway. NEVER AGAIN.",1

In fact, I wish that it was franchised and that another location would open closer to my home.

I was in the area the other day and my companions were jonesing coffee after a very long workshop. Their cafe beats Starbucks, Lettieri, or Second Cup ... the price is so reasonable and the service is excellent. For one double espresso, two lattes, and four cannolis I paid under $10. If I were at Starbucks, my total would be four times that amount. 

Woohoo! As good as it gets!",5
347,"Oh my god!  This place should be outlawed because of the scrumptious food and the unbelievably large servings!  But please don't tell anyone, because I want to go back for more!  Chicken and waffles (had it twice while in Vegas from 1/8-16/11), was some of the best food I've ever eaten.  Too bad I could only handle eating one piece of chicken and one bacon-stuffed waffle each time.  The BLT Bloody Mary was the absolute best!  We went late on a weeknight and walked right in.  Went at 10:30 on a Saturday morning and waited almost an hour--worth the wait!  Everything our group had was fantastic--don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu.   Note: The Snicker flap jack sounds too decadent to eat--it is!--but eat it anyway!!!  Enjoy!",5
348,"I would give this company no stars for this review if I could! 

The technician named Jesse solicited us over the phone, asking us if we needed windshield glass repair. We did, so we agreed to go with his company because he promised us we would receive a $100 check back after we had our windshield replaced. That was about a month ago and we never got the check! I called and spoke to the sales manager named Jeremy, who was a complete sleazeball! He lied through his teeth, saying Jesse was a new tech and they never offer $100 checks, only $100 restaurant coupons. He didn't offer to fix it and issue the check as promised, he didn't say he would correct Jesse and tell him to stop lying to customers, he just wanted me off the phone. He must get complaints all day because he knew exactly what he wanted to say, and couldn't care less that we were lied to. Don't use this company! FYI...They also operate under the name Glass Service Center.

I plan to file a compliant with the BBB and the Arizona - Consumer Fraud Division. They need to be held accountable for their promised lies!",1

I had no idea they offered a free flat repair service.  I was in and out in under an hour.  Their staff is exceptionally friendly and the service is superb.  When I do need new tires or any tire service, I'm always coming to this location.",5
350,"Once again, thank you Yelpers!!  Went there for dinner on our last night in Phoenix. 
Its literally in a small house, very cute.

Staff were welcoming, friendly, and helpful.  We called ahead to inquire about the dress code b/c we did not bring dressy or biz casuals.  Staff reassured us that we would be fine in casuals.

Dishes were amazing and creative.  For example: Karei Karaage - fried black sole with blood orange blood orange vinaigrette sitting in a bone chips bowl.  Yeah! Very Creative! You could actually eat the bone chips. It was crunchy like potato chips. Awesome. Black sole was fresh and tasty. Blood orange vinaigrette was light and sweet.

Soft shelled shrimps: shells were SO crispy, you could actually eat the heads and tails. Say What?! I kid you not. I am Asian. I do not eat the shrimps' heads or tails.  No no.  Guess what? I ate it. Yup. *Crunch*crunch* All gone...Yummy!!

Yellow Tail Ceviche: soft and buttery. Melted in our mouths.

Dishes were perfectly seasoned.  Light and flavorful. 

Great experience. Must try when you visit Phoenix.",5

Good beer list, and although I always get pizza, one of these days I'm going to try their tacos. I mean seriously pizza AND tacos?!?!",5
369,"Do not go here! The manager is a complete moron. Like United Airlines, they overbooked and then randomly or deliberately deny people entry despite sending a confirmation email confirming the reservation. The manager is an overweight rude guy. I explained to him that I had my reservation yet the guy didn't even let me complete my sentences, talked over me and was rude. He kept saying, ""I called you to tell you we are overbooked as soon as you reserved the table."" Well, he called me 30 minutes after my reservation was confirmed. It's completely unacceptable to cancel someone's reservation. That's why you make the reservation in the first place. Remember the Sienfeld episode. Btw, I think if they're overbooked they're more likely to reject you if your name does not sound Caucasian... It's the colonial mentality.",1
373,"I haven't been treated this badly by someone I was paying money to in my life.  I had to go to the post office to get my mail after they removed it from my post box (I don't have the luxury of getting my mail every day). When I presented my ID the clerk asked my why I haven't picked up my mail, and since I don't think I need to explain myself to her I didn't answer.  She proceeded to tell me that I must answer her, so I told her I was busy.  She said that wasn't good enough.  I haven't been treated that way since I was in the third grade.

After threatening to stop delivering all mail to my home she finally got my mail which included several large packages that wouldn't have fit in my mailbox anyway.

When did it become my obligation to go out of my way to pick up piles of junk mail that I proceed to throw directly into the recycle bin, just to keep from inconveniencing the USPS?  

Hey, USPS, focus more on serving your customers and less on telling them how to live their lives!",1
374,"Seriously! Bed bugs woke me up at midnight! Caught 5 of those little bastards.
The hotel had someone drop us off keys to a new room. Didn't bother to send a bellman to help with the luggage and offered us a free breakfast buffet. They said they had to have someone come in to verify the bugs before they could do anything else! Ugh! And they put us a few doors down! Not happy at 1:00am!",1
375,Delicious and fresh food.  We started with the lemon cilantro hummus.  OMY (Oh My Yum) was it good.  I love cilantro and it had a strong cilantro taste and burst of lemon.  I ended up dipping fries and my gyro in the leftover hummus.  I had the greek salad and gyro and my group split the fries.  Everything was super flavorful.  My dining companion had a coupon for a free baklava and although I'm not much for baklava I had a taste and it was good as well.  Can't wait to go back and try more from the menu.,5
380,"Beware of over charging. Ordered a pizza and had an entertainment book 50% off coupon. Notified them when I ordered.  When the pizza arrived it had a $10 off instead of the $14 off that should have been taken off. 

Delivery guy wasn't any help with the matter despite giving him the coupon. 

Pizza was mediocre at best. Sauce has no flavor.",1
381,Needed to get my nails done on a weekend trip to Vegas and decided to come here based on the great Yelp reviews. SUCH a good choice! I was greeted and seated right away. They asked what I wanted and didn't challenge me on what I wanted (you know how some salons are). The chair was comfy. Ha did my pedicure and Ben did my full set. Both were hospitable and friendly. They didn't try to upsell me the entire time; just talked to me like a normal human being. I'm actually going to be moving to Las Vegas soon so I'm happy I found a nail salon!,5
383,"I'm from the Midwest area, which authentic Japanese dining is very limited. Everytime I visit Vegas ( at least twice per year), I would make a reservation for Raku. The restaurant is limited in space and highly rcmd reservation (they usually seat reservation in one of the private booth/room). Rcmd checking out the bathroom which has a fish tank and heated toilet.  I've been to Raku for few times and these reviews are based on all the items i've tried. Sometimes, there may be a language barrier and was difficult to understand the type of fish or entree for the daily special. 

Skewers: The price on the menu is for one skewer. Skewers are cooked over a special type of charcoal from Japan, therefore you would really taste a bbq/charcoal flavor in the meat.

Kobe tendon - Rcmd sharing this skewer with others. The tendon which is good fat, would melt like butter in your mouth. Don't consume too much of it because it very heavy in taste. I would just take a bite of it for sampling. 

Kobe beef filet with wasabi - $12 a skewer for kobe filet which was a thick cut. It was good, but it was okay. Maybe it was too well done, I prefer medium rare. Personally, I think the kobe skirt which was thinly sliced tasted better.

kobe beef outside skirt $8- One of my favorite skewer, the beef was tender and tad of charcoal taste to it. Not too overdone and just right. 

beef tongue - delicious and it's a bit crispy and bouncy to the taste, 

Kurobuta Pork cheek - Very tasty. Love it.

chicken - I always order the wrong chicken or  different chicken skewer but it's all tender and juicy,

yellowtail $7 - Good deal for a tasty filet of yellowtail with glazed sweet sauce over it. It was flaming delicious. 

eggplant - direct flamed eggplant that was covered with bonito flake. It was not spectacular, but average.

Regular food item:
Raku tofu - home made tofu that is nicely presented. I usually sprinkle with the matcha sea salt and bit of the house soy sauce. My usual appetizer that i order every time.

Udon with foie gras custard soup - The udon is served cold in a basket and I think it's homemade because it's not the typical thick udon. The foie gras is infused in the egg custard. You dip the cold udon into the warm foie custard soup. Sooo hearty... Unfortunately, i flll up on the skewer and never have room for the udon.

Poached egg with sea urchin and salmon roe - pretty much everything mixed together in a small bowl. It's all raw and raw. The taste was okay and fresh, but not amazing. The texture was slimy Been there, done that.. ill try something else next time

Juicy deep fried chicken - fried chicken and the chicken was juicy and tender. 

Grilled rice ball -  a ball of rice that is fried on the outside. Cool concept, but i'll skip it and save room for the skewers.

Daily Chef's special:
rock fish - The whole fish was served in chunks of sashimi which was sweet and EXTREMELY fresh. My friend and I finished the whole fish. Soy sauce and wasabi is not needed, just chew it raw!!!  It's very reasonable for $45. Later, the bones of the fish was fried and served. This is one of my favorite fish.

wagyu beef sukiyaki - Do you know how difficult to find a restaurant that serves sukiyaki the right way? Most place would just dump the meat and the vegetable in a bowl and serve it.  Raku does it just like how it's done in Tokyo! The vegetable are cooking over a pot of charcoal claypot and the raw meat is placed atop and simmers to your liking. The waiter would crack a raw egg in a bowl and it's used for dipping for the meat. Love IT and i wish there was more meat to it.

Overall, one of my favorite robata grill. After the meal, it's pretty heavy and you might to drink some alcohol with your meal. The plaza that this restaurant is located is a Foodie paradise. In this plaza, there is Sweets Raku, Monta Ramen, Kung fu tea, Snowflake shavery ice, kabuto, Japanese curry, and Japanese Italian noodle (not sure of the name).",5
384,Enjoyed my time here. The waitress was wonderful and the was rewarding. The creamy crab soup was so good and tasty?,5
385,"Sad to say it, but this is a show that should've been imploded right along with the Riviera. Not modern day strip quality production value by a long shot.

Most of the ""girls"", while in great shape, all looked like they could've been your favorite auntie w/ major freaky cougariffic tendencies...You know the one. Always making people uncomfortable with the sex jokes at Thanksgiving. Only one of the 7 women would ever be anywhere close to my girl crush list. Now THAT is crazy.

The biggest bummer of the show was it's lack of melanin. This show's marketing, even in it's golden heyday, has included at least one black butt in the signature pose lineup...a butt I was looking forward to seeing in real life! Sadly, those chocolatey buttocks never appeared. The most horrible joke was the ""big booty"" number where the girls donned Nicki Minaj-esqe neon outfits and shook their mini tail feathers off beat to a poor excuse for hip hop. Just delete this scene guys. I'm just gonna end this paragraph with Black Buns Matter.

Maybe I've just been spoiled by the elegant smorgasbord which was once Jubilee, but I honestly considered walking out well before the 30 minute mark because Crazy Girls immediately struck me as cheap and stale. Never a good sign.",1
386,Great Mexican food made like my Mama & Nana did it! You can't get any closer to old school home cooked food unless Nana cooks it! Love their fresh chips. GREEN CORN TAMALES are Chicken MOLE is the Nest in Phx IMO. Service is good & beers always cold!,5
387,"Nothing special. Seems like they try very hard to be different but don't focus on the important stuff. Food was mediocre and service was sub par. I called ahead and was placed on a list for a wait. This wasn't a problem because when I got there, I received a pager and was told I had only 1 ahead of me on the list. Once I was sat the server had a smile which you could tell was forced and after taking my drink order I saw her flirting with another server in the back. The manager came by later in the meal and was very keen on trying to be my friend even though I was still trying to eat my food and could be seen trying to just enjoy the half decent meal I was given. From looking around at the people that work here, very few actual look like they enjoy their job, or even want to work there. 100% would not recommend to other people looking for a place to eat. The only claim to fame is the german pancake which to be frank was nothing more than a crepe or a flakey pie crust. If I had to go again I'd probably just go to village inn.",1
389,"Went back today for some BBQ. Had the brisket sandwich. It was tender and smoky with a generous portion of brisket and the right amount of barbeque sauce. And for an added bonus the smell of the smoker in the restaurant was slight but heavenly. 

Thank you MJ's for great food and being so close to work.

on a side note:
I love it when a restaurant that sells BBQ food actually smells like BBQ. I have been in a few restaurants around town that don't smell like smoke inside or out that claim to be BBQ restaurants.",5
391,George and his team did a great job on my Chevy Suburban.  Inside and out was very detailed and cleaned. I'm so happy with the friendly service and the price. Thanks.,5
393,"I'm very skeptical about getting my hair done in new places, but I needed a quick wash & blow out and found this place on yelp. The inside of the salon was decorated very nicely, and the people who worked there were very nice as well. I have extremely thick hair and it is about shoulder length so I really appreciated the stylist taking her time with my hair. After the stylist finished my hair, I was so in love with the shop. My hair turned out amazing! And I cannot wait to return to the shop. I recommend this shop to anyone who needs their hair done & is looking for a Dominican blowout. Prices were your average hair salon prices, possibly a little more or less expensive depending on the type of hair and length.",5
397,"i've been waiting for a juice store to open here and this one has everything you'd want. 

fresh,  cold-pressed, and(most importantly) delicious juices. 

The staff is very knowledgable and helpful with tastings and explanations of what each juice does. 

The nut milks are so good!  they'll make you believe you can survive a juice cleanse :P",5
398,"This hotel is great. They know how to do details. The beds are big and comfy, the shower has great pressure. 2 free water bottles in the room daily. I printed and photocopied from the business center free. Breakfast is great with hot options and good service. There is free underground parking, free wifi, and a 24 hour gym. The jacuzzi and Pool is in the Courtyard, along with the restaurant and bar, and really for a decent price, this hotel has everything you could want!

I don't have any complaints at all, and had a wonderful two-night stay while visiting the University of Calgary for a conference.

Bravo, Best Western!",5
399,"This place is awesome. My girlfriend and I walked in from the cold Pittsburgh streets and for an hour we were transported to the islands. The food was fantastic, jerk chicken and curry goat in generous portions, but what made the experience special was the warm hospitality of the owner. He knew we were first timers and walked us through the menu, offering helpful suggestions throughout. The whole atmosphere was very Caribbean, with brightly painted walls, a steel drum in the corner, upbeat island music giving the dining experience an energetic feel. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone. Be careful though, the jerk chicken is not for the faint of heart!",5
400,"Never again will I waste my time with them.  Applied on-line.  Called to get pre-approved.  Was told I was pre approved and got an email saying so

Was told to bring in documents to local store. 
* Government/State Issued ID 
* Proof of Income:  your most current bank statement or pay stub (Since I own my own business and am self employed I was told to bring last 90 days bank transactions to show income)
* Proof of Bank Account:  your most recent bank statement or a bank statement including the previous 30-days transactions.
So I gathered my info and went to the W. Sahara location.  First I was told eventhough I filled out everything on-line they need a hand written application.. so I start filling that out.. waste of time number one... while I'm doing that I give them all the requested documents... Then I was asked for my business license... okay it was never mentioned I would need it, but luckily I had brought it just in case... My business is licensed in California, where I moved from and I am in the process of moving it to Nevada, so I give them the CA business license info and I am told that the business has to be licenesed in NV... so I have proof of income from a bank in town.. why in the world would it matter where the business is based.. if I worked for a business that has its corporate office in New York and I work in NV and I get paid in NV how does it matter where the business is based?  This made no sense.. when I was pre approved on the phone it was never mentioned or asked where the business was licensed... They knew from my on line application and from my conversation on the phone that I owned my own business.. why wasn't it ever mentioned?  How was I pre-approved then told I didn't meet their requirements after I had wasted my time gathering the info they wanted and going to their location? 

I left and called their 800 number back.. explained to the customer service rep my problem and he agreed that it shouldn't matter at all where the business is licensed... he asked what location I went to and after a 10 minute hold (another total waste of my time it turns out) he connected me to someone who I believe was at the location I went to.  Again I explained my problem and was told ""That just our policy!"" Really!??!!?  Then how about you ask the question on the website or on the phone before you pre-approve someone and have them jump through hoops to get denied!

BIGGEST WASTE OF MY TIME EVER!",1
401,"I went in last week to browse guitars with my 16 year old son.  Greg, the Manager, could not have been nicer, more helpful or patient!  The 2 other staff we interacted with at the counter were totally pleasant and helpful.  We had a great experience and will definitely be back!",5
403,"I've stayed here twice and love it. The rooms are nice, the service is wonderful, and the walk off of the strip is worth saving a bit of money and still being in a really nice hotel. The most recent time I was here was for a bachelorette party. Our group slept in the room comfortably (I wasn't one of the people on the pull-out couch, though, so I can't really speak for how comfortable that was) and it wasn't a cramped struggle for the bathroom or anything. The previous time I was here, we had a little kitchenette, which was nice, but the ""kitchen"" area in the most recent room wasn't the greatest and was almost an inconvenience. It felt a little strange because people were placing their things on the stovetop, which made me nervous, but I also earned the nickname ""Mom"" during this trip, so maybe that's saying something.

Anyways, I'd certainly stay here again after two great experiences.",5
404,"I basically paid money to get my 2 year old infected with hand foot and mouth disease. We went there this past weekend. All of the foam blocks, play kitchen stuff, and things that kids love to play with in ""Artville"" were really dirty, some of them even smelled gross. It was obvious they aren't regularly sanitized, if ever. My wife and I kept joking that we were all going to get a stomach bug just by being there, and sure enough today our daughter was diagnosed with hand, foot and mouth disease. There is no doubt that she got it at the IDEA museum, she hasn't been around any other kids that have had it. This place is even more of a germ factory than a daycare, at least daycares have regulations they have to follow to keep their toys clean. We never should have come here, and never will go back.",1
405,"Dani was our bartender was on point, very attentive and friendly. We definitely will be back.
We also had dinner. The food is super delicious, the atmosphere was fantastic.  Good times!",5
407,"One star. It's only because they won't let me give it zero stars. Read this carefully, if you book your room through a third party, such as Orbitz, they do not guarantee the room that you booked online. Traveled with my brother and booked a two double bed room and when we arrived all they had were rooms with a single king bed. Was told by the front desk I could get a roll away bed brought into the room at an extra charge of $10 a night if they had any available. Didn't matter whether they had any available or not because I had no intention of giving this place any more of my money. I travel often and I mean i travel a lot and this is the first time I have ever had this happen to me. I have stayed in nicer hotels at cheaper prices and haven't dealt with this kind of problem ever. Needless to say I have crossed all Hilton hotels off my traveling list. Also, room was tiny, small fridge, breakfast was not free where as in most places I stay it's complimentary. Bath tub floor was slick, tried to be careful didn't matter because I busted my you know what in the shower. Just an all around poor experience and I will not be back. One last thing, you hear everything that happens in the hallways no matter what's going on and that sucks when you are trying to sleep.",1
408,"A group of friends and I came here for a friend's birthday.  It was my first time, but it's been one of her favorite Vegas steak joints for awhile now.  

First, our waiter ""Hammer"" is freaking amazing. 

My favorites were:

Appetizers: pork belly bacon, bone marrow, shellfish tower

Main: wagyu rib eye cap with scallops

Side: potato gratin, mac and cheese

Dessert: sorbets",5
412,"The happy hour in the bar is amazing. The best deals I ever seen. From 3-4, $3.00 wine and appetizers, certain well drinks and beer too at $3.00, from 4-5, prices go to $4.00, etc. 
Clare is the best bartender since the TV show Cheers. Oh and the Pinot Grigio there is sublime. 
Do NOT NOT miss the bean dip. 
Dinner there is amazing. I had the Mexican Ceasar salad with mesquite grilled shrimp on it and a side of Fideo, the only place in town that has Fideo. They could cook it like crap if they wanted to but they don't

420,"Stumbled upon this cute restaurant/grocery store in the heart of Tempe near the light rail. I was craving a gyro sandwich but got the Gyro Plate with Rice and salad. It truly was amazing and filling. I ordered the Arabic coffee, wow, it woke me right up. An amazing lunch!  I will definitely be back!",5
423,Super fast service from fast and accurate employees. This location is inside a Safeway store. It has plenty of seating and available wifi through the Safeway network. I really like this place. It was an unexpected treat.,5
425,"We just moved to the area and after reading reviews and on the advice from a family member, we brought our Golden Retriever in for a quick check up and a grooming. The veterinarian, Dr Glanzberg, was very helpful and made some solid recommendations to help him lose some weight and to help with his arthritis. Kayla did a spectacular job with his grooming. His fur is so soft and shiny and his ears were perfectly cleaned. The front desk staff was helpful and the office was clean and sanitary. We are very happy with the service we got and will be back soon!",5

My biggest complaint of most dentist they always seem to want to ""up-sell"" so when you walk out you have a proposal for thousands of dollars for dental work, much which is never needed. That has not be my experience with Dr. Dorsey. He and his staff are extremely helpful and caring. I appreciate they will only propose work that is actually necessary.",5
429,"Fantastic restaurant. Great location in a well developed shopping center. The decor of the restaurant flowed nicely. Good rustic theme. The service was good, kept the refills coming. Very friendly. We came for dinner at night and breakfast in the morning. Both meals were excellent. Perfect size portions too.",5

436,I rarely do the review thing but I had to this time.  Super friendly staff and ohhh the food.  The garlic knots may be the best I've had in Charlotte... No joke they are baked perfectly.  The pizza is legit and on par or better than anything I've had in Charlotte.  Definitely coming back for sure!,5
438,Great food and atmosphere. Juana tacos were my favorite but I also tried two varieties of eggs Benedict which were also great.,5
441,"We had the Western Associations of Independent Camps conference here and we really loved this location. It's a beautiful resort overlooking a lake. We rode the peddle boats, went swimming in the lovely pool, and the little town in nice to walk around in. The rooms were adequate with free wifi, water, and coffee/tea. The best thing about this place is the really nice staff. All of them were sweet, competent, and did a great job. We will speak highly of this resort.",5
443,"Cocktails and small plates on the patio. You must ask for Timmy. Witty, knowledgable and fun! White cranberry cosmos and ivy and ginger first round.",5
445,Great service when purchasing our jeep and follow through.  Service has been very good and  able to schedule at times convenient to my schedule.,5
446,"Just as excellent as the downtown location.  
Had the Chick and Chop.  Normally I have to get the nice thick cuts of bacon though.  
Sourdough toast tastes like it just flew in from SF.  And the preserves are so good I could drink it. 
Wife had flapjacks, not a big pancake guy, We didn't  think they were that special.",5
447,"To find the perfect groomer for your beloved dog is not always an easy task. My dogs are my kids. We moved here from Colorado and I tried four or five different places before trying Best in Show. 
What can I say other then she knew exactly how I felt and what I wanted. She used to rescue dogs for a living. I rescue dogs for a living. It is a daunting task. She understands the passion it takes to do what we do, she doesn't take it lightly, and she is there any time I need her. Whether it's a routine groom, or I just found a dog hiding under a car, emaciated and painfully matted, She is there to help. Just yesterday, I brought in one of our seizure dogs. This dog needed quiet and calm and to not be too excited. She went back there and groomed him herself !! 
I actually can't say enough good things about the place. The prices are fantastic, the location is fantastic and the staff is even better. My dogs always come out looking so fantastic and smelling great. 
The only con for me is that I live far away.",5
449,"ECE is full of good food, nice staff, and plenty of Boston sports on the TVs.  After multiple visits, I have found that there is no best thing on the menu, everything is equally mouthwatering and as such, everything should be tried at least once.  Cajun chicken bomb is amazing, as are the diablo wings.

This restaurant never skimps on anything, making sure each meal is satisfying, full of meat, seafood, and sauce.  Best part is that the prices are fair!",5

The snow ice is so fluffly. Upon first glance you might think it to be just plain old ice cream but when you scoop it up and eat it you can immediately tell the difference. It has a very light almost shredded type of texture (like confetti??). I got the taro flavor with red bean, strawberry and mochi. It was very light and I didn't feel full after I ate it and it wasn't overly sweet. I will definitely be coming back with my friends.",5

Not worthy of paying what I did. The blind was stuck and wouldn't come all the way down. The water pressure in the shower is very low. The water doesn't get very hot at all.

So far there has been a long wait for a waiter/waitress to come around for drink orders.  After receiving our appetizer 10 minutes ago, we're still waiting for silverware to be able to eat it.  We've been told that they are currently rolling the silverware in napkins and we will have silverware soon.  Still waiting!  The food is great but the service at this location couldn't be worse.",1
481,"I hope this doesn't sound corny, patronizing or worst, racist, but I want to talk about the atmosphere of this place. In some wonderful family restaurants run by new American families who have come from elsewhere, you feel like you are getting the delicious authentic food, but in an Americanized setting like a strip mall or lower rent neighborhood where they haven't had time or money to try to make it more like home, or show off their culture.  I can totally appreciate and go with that and often actually prefer it because it's the food and flavor that matter to me. In Phoenix, this is true of Khyber Halal, and Da Vang, for example, although they each share with patrons some few homey icons I find lovely (rugs, shrine, respectively).   Other restaurants try harder on the decor and lighting, and it's a miss, because you feel they've kind of thrown up some predictable version of what Americans expect for their country's style, a la Chinese buffet with jello at American truckstop. Actually, I'm rarely a fan of restaurant ambiance, kind of dislike it mostly, especially when I feel I'm being courted (marketed) with that instead of the food.  I suppose the idea is to blend an impression on multiple senses to make dining an experience, but I have found it much more accessible and enjoyable when its not staged for me quite so obviously as it is at cool concept restaurants, not that i don't like some of them.  I think it mostly doesn't work, even in beautiful settings because the best eating experiences to me are intimate, even open-hearted, and its hard to achieve intimate when you are big and successful.  (Which reminds me, I need to review August in New Orleans for gifting me brioche for breakfast after an incredible dinner, when I was agonizing over what I had to forego in the face of so much lusciousness to choose from.)

With that preamble, I'd like to say that the atmosphere, the deep colors, the lighting, I don't know...the feeling of Reathrey Sekong, from its strange-to-my-ears name to the amount of space inside the tiny room dedicated to a ""sofa setting"" of furniture, is kind of wonderful.  Ok, I'm going to say it, poetic.  It's gently happy and softly lit, and just well  put together.   Kind of a perfect smile on the solo server, pretty food, a menu that is charmingly written.  Examples: serving intestines and asking if you've got the ""guts""), and, come on, who couldn't love ""student noodles.""  

And, yes, as everyone else here has said, it's delicious.  Thank you to the owners and staff.  I'll be back.",5

484,"Came here to order a pizza-to-go for lunch. Walked in. There was no one to great us and only people at one table. After about 10 minutes we got the attention of someone in the kitchen. The woman took our pizza order. When I asked how long she said ""I don't know, the chef is having a meeting with the staff"". I cancelled the order and just left. Would not return here.",1
487,Go next door to shake shack! We were told it would be 10 minutes for a table. We were a larger group so we were ok with waiting. It took 30 minutes to sit down in an empty restaurant. It took another hour to get out food. Again... an empty restaurant. Then a meal didn't come for 1 person in the party and a burger was undercooked for another. Our drinks were left at the bar to the point we had to get up and get them ourselves. Still no real apology from anyone.,1
488,"My name is Ann and I live in North Phoenix. I recently had the pleasure of working with Adalberto (Albert) Morales and Cactus Curbing LLC. I had several estimates for needed landscape work in my backyard, and all were too expensive. I chose to work with Albert and Cactus Curbing because the estimate given was a fair price and I'd read great reviews about Cactus Curbing. I'm so very glad I chose to work with Cactus Curbing. Albert and his crew began and finished the job on time and within the estimate given as promised. His excellent advice, along with professional workmanship, turned my dead dust bowl of a yard, into a beautiful paradise, complete with a sprinkler/drip system, rocked landscape and plants and shrubs I enjoy. I highly recommend Albert and his team at Cactus Curbing. If you have any question about their services or professionalism, please contact me directly.
Thank you,

493,"My friend and I were in town for SHOT Show and decided we wanted to shoot some full auto stuff. Come to find out the Strip had the best prices out of the major ranges. I paid online and received an email and call within the hour confirming the date and time of my reservation. 

Gabi and the driver were there on time the next morning with our shuttle to the range. 

We arrived and Taryn greeted us to help us pick out some of the weapons we wanted to shoot. After signing the various waivers, we met our RSO Chris. He was super friendly and made everything very easy. It was a small range but don't let that deter you from visiting. They have a very good selection of weapons to choose from and customer service was top notch. I would not hesitate to stop by and try some more guns.",5
496,I went in today for Andy to do a gel polish change as well as thin out my nails from having them done by someone else. He did such a great job as usual. Will be back. Thx Andy.,5
499,I enjoy this place every time I come into town to watch the Cardinals.  The manager is responsive and the staff works hard.  I enjoy the food.  My kids love the kool aid and i love the bloody mary's.,5
501,"I have been to the Super Summer Theater about 4-5 times and have seen such productions as ""Tom Sawyer,"" ""Noises Off,"" ""Aria,"" and my favorite musical, ""1776.""  The quality of these productions are surprisingly good, and the price (I think it's $10 in advance and $15 at the door) are more than reasonable.  It's a great value.  Plus, you can bring your own food and drink to the production- no more spending $5 for a hot dog or $7 for a beer!  I highly recommend going out to Red Rock to catch any production you have the chance to, this theater production is well worth the effort to see!",5
502,"I absolutely LOVE this place. How can you not love, and support a local place like this?  They are SO friendly. The service is second to none. They have a game room for kids of all ages, and a 24 hour drive through. Get the card, stamp your way to freebies, and don't forget the Yelp check in. The place is more than just coffee. Nothing like 5 star service with a smile, every time!",5

513,The best blace for Chinese food you must experience this place.  Hard working attentive employees make this place very successful. They are extremely polite and you will not have to wait for anything they are they for you and they show it.,5
517,I really wanted to give them a 0. But today is the last day I will go this location and maybe Canes in general the manager that was duty early in the afternoon was real rude. I don't want to get into all the details. But thank you Canes because you showed that you don't care about customer service..,1
518,"If I could give this place a 0 I would. Got my nails done on Friday morning. 3 have broken already. To their credit the woman did say if they broke to come back and they will fix it for free but why would I want to go back there? The nail tech burned 6 out of 10 fingers. Complained about how short I asked my nails to be. Saying ""you want short French? Oh that's not right French is long"" my fingers hurt for hours after visiting this place. I have gotten my nails done every other week for YEARS. I know little things happen but never in all the time I have been getting them done has anything like this happened. I just moved from Florida and I was really hoping this would be my go to place. It is certainly not. I wouldn't recommend this place for you dog. Save your money ladies and go somewhere else.",1
524,"My sister and I needed to eat so we came here. 

It's not easy to find for some reason but it was okay to just kind of wander around The Venetian. 

We walked in and got seated immediately. 

I ordered the lunch special salad + pasta. I got the carbonara which was good but got very heavy really fast. 

My sister got the salmon with rice which she enjoyed. 

Service was good and the ambiance was nice. 

Would come again and recommend to others!",5

526,"Pricing is way to high, ask how much it would cost was told $160 when I went to pick it up it was $316 when asked I was told they quoted me for the part only (I know I did not ask what the part costs, I only want to know what the job costs), had I known I would not have had the work done since I new I could get the part online for $60 and an easy install, located right on top of the motor easy access, 2 screws and a plug maybe a 10 minute job, they charged me for 1 hour @ $125 and where do they come up with shop supplies of $17 couldn't have used more than one wrench I think I paid for that wrench a few times. After all that it didn't fix the problem I did not need that part, and they diagnosed it. They don't deserve any stars because all they did was waste my time and money.
This is the second time they did this to me last year they put a part in my Bronco that it didn't need for $280, when I went back and told them it didn't fix the problem I was told I didn't explain the problem properly.",1
528,We went in and since one of us was rather full so we decided to order only 1 mini pot with 2 bowls of rice and some beef skewers. When its time to pay we realised that we were charged 2 bowls of rice instead of 1 since 1 rice always comes free with a mini pot. What a ripped off!,1
529,"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE! I will say I don't normally go to this location but I had a dr appt and it was close by. I went through the drive thru and ordered a sliced turkey breakfast sandwich. The woman didn't seem to understand what I wanted but said to come to the window. I paid for the sandwich and looked at my receipt and noticed they rang up something else. The girl at the window hands me my sandwich and I can tell the bag is a lot heavier than it should be. I look at the wrapping and can tell it is not what I ordered. I hand it back and say I wanted the sliced turkey sandwich and the girl hands it back to her co workers. She explains to them what I asked for and I can hear the employees arguing over what it is that I want and how to make this sandwich. Instead of clarifying with me what is it that I want they make another wrong sandwich and I finally say I wanted a refund because 10 minutes had passed since I arrived to the Dunkin Donuts. In the background I hear more conversation from the employees saying ""this isn't Starbucks and you can't order secret menu items"" with the manager Kathy standing there with them. Kathy comes to the window and says it's not a menu item they carry, which is fine HAD THEY EXPLAINED that from the get go. The reason I was upset was the lack of respect by the employees and the manager standing with them allowing that type of conversation to take place where I can hear. I asked for Kathy's supervisor who she said was currently out of town and I could fill out a survey if I was dissatisfied. I will NEVER go back to Dunkin Donuts. I am absolutely disgusted with how I was treated and how this ""manager"" couldn't handle a wrong order and let her employees say rude and disrespectful things where I could hear.",1
532,"I LOVE this place. My boyfriend and I used to go there on dates when we went to school there, and we'd order the cheese fondue and a bottle of wine. It's a great date place, and the ambiance is better than many places in the Champaign-Urbana area. 

Plus, the prices are very reasonable! I'll be going back whenever we're down there!",5
533,"I've eaten at Carnevino a couple of times in the lounge area where I've ordered from the less expensive bar menu, and have been thoroughly impressed (they have a better fancy burger than Bradley Ogden, if you ask me) so my husband and I decided to eat in the dining room for our first anniversary on Sunday. The understated decor is reminiscent of a simple yet sophisticated Italian country villa, and the general aura is relaxed and welcoming. 

Every person on the wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable and the managers were gracious and accommodating. Because it was our anniversary we each received a complimentary glass of Bastianich's own Brut upon arrival (normally $14 a pop), but more notably, because we are locals, we received 15 % off our entire bill. I believe Batali is the only chef thus far to offer such a discount on a regular basis, and he should be commended for it. 

For an appetizer we ordered the pappardelle with 'porcini trifolati,' or cooked porcini mushrooms($22). Porcini mushrooms are my favorite mushroom. They are generally large and have a sponge-like underside rather than gills, giving them a kind of chewy yet slippery texture. When I saw porcini I got incredibly excited because the only place I have seen fresh porcini mushrooms in the states is at the Ferry Building farmer's market in San Francisco. While living in Italy they could be found everywhere in the Fall, even at road stands, and I frequently ordered this exact dish whenever I could. Needless to say I was truly disappointed when the dish came out full of shitakes and other varieties of mushrooms, with nothing like the porcinis I know and love. If the menu had just said 'pappardelle with mushrooms' I would have been completely satisfied, as the pasta was beautifully home-made and tossed in a light yet buttery sauce. Sadly, this misrepresentation showed up more than once on the menu. Our spinach side was supposed to have cherry peppers to give a kick, yet didn't, and our 'spring peas with pancetta' turned out to be snow peas. 

The steak was the real showstopper of the meal. I try to be frugal when dining out, but as a self-proclaimed foodie I am also willing to pay big money for something novel and ridiculously good. That something today was the 240 day dry-aged steak that cost $100 an inch. Dry-aging of beef is basically the controlled rotting of the exterior of the meat in a cold environment that results in the formation of a skin, or pellicle, that is then removed prior to cooking. It is an expensive process and therefore results in better, but less frugal, cuts of meat. Most well-marbled high grade meat is dry-aged for some amount of time as it dramatically enhances and concentrates the flavor, but this time can range from a few weeks to about the 240 days given the riserva steak here (we were told the slaughter date for our beef was circa early August, 2009). A second manager prepared it for us tableside by skillfully slicing it on a wooden board and drizzling it with the chef's recommendation of a little olive oil and a sprinkle of salt. We ordered the horseradish black pepper zabaglione as an accompanying sauce, but despite its ethereal qualities, it was utterly unnecessary and almost felt like a sin to use on this particular piece of meat. The inherent flavors of the steak were not powerful enough to stand up to it, and only by eating the steak alone could you truly appreciate the process and time required to create such a masterpiece. The wait staff described the flavor as earthy, but for me it was as if the aroma you get when you first walk into a fabulous cheese store (such as Murray's in the West Village) found its way into the meat and then ultimately into your mouth in a subtle yet obvious way. Combine that with the intensely flavored juices of the best quality steak you can buy and the result is unlike anything you've had before. As I continued to analyze the complexity of flavors twinkling in my mouth I looked over at my husband and saw teardrops welling in his eyes. When he noticed I was looking at him he said, ""I'll cry over meat, I don't give a f*#!."" I was hoping he was tearing up over how happy he felt to be married to me, but no, it was the steak he was feeling such a fondness for. I really wasn't hurt at all because I felt the same, and in all fairness, you can't have a steak like that everyday for the rest of your life. 

As far as Strip restaurants go, I would be more inclined to come back here rather than try some of the other celebrity chef restaurants I haven't yet been to. Usually you don't get what you pay for, but I felt the prices charged here were deserved. To boot, the service and ambiance were top notch without being stuffy. If you are looking for a special occasion place, Carnevino is now on my list of top ten Strip restaurants.

534,I've ate here many times and it's never disappointed. I just tried the tostadas today with chorizo and found my new favorite item on the menu. Definitely one of the best meals I have had in some time.,5
536,"The place has always been a favorite of ours.  The food is very fresh and tasty.  The staff if friendly and is will to accommodate.
It can get busy and sometimes have to wait for a table.",5
537,"A well maintained trail for walking, running, or biking. The trail is actually paved with dirt trails below in several areas. One could get a few miles in on this trail and make it even longer by joining up with The Arroyo Grande Sports Complex. There are even scenic stop offs with picnic tables.

Even though the trail crosses several major roads the trail is very quiet and relaxing as it cuts through residential neighborhoods. Each major road has an underground path so that you don't have to cross busy roads. I was glad to find this option as it seems like a much safer way to travel the path. 

The path was free of garbage and animal waste. We saw volunteers cleaning up the area close to the wash as we walked too. I was glad to see that not only does the city maintain the path, but the public using the trail takes pride in keeping it clean. The area around the path was also prettier than I expected with green grass in areas and trees along the trail that were well cared for too.",5
542,"This was my first visit to this location, but as many have mentioned once you have been to one Chipotle you've been to them all.  I went  to this location since 50% of sales went to a school fund raiser for my son.  98.7% of the time I get the Burrito Bowl and this visit was no different.  It was amazing like normal.  I also tried their Queso for the very first time and it was very good as well.  It was very busy since there was a fund raiser going on, but our wait in line was less than ten minutes from the time we parked until we were eating huge burrito bowls.",5
543,"This place is amazing!! Had the chicken club panini, delicious. That garlic house sauce is sooo good. Make sure to ask for on the side to dip the sandwich. And had the lavender milk tea the young girl up front is super nice and helped me pick these great items! Great choices. Thanks!!",5
544,"I have to say something about this place . First of all  I pull in and as I was looking around confused looking for the front office no one came out to greet me. Until someone came out and said go ahead and look around the cars are open. Umm ok? Aren't you going to show me or help me ? Fine I look around and finally the same guy comes outside and I ask what I need to qualify , and he says go ""apply online and we will see if we can qualify you"" . Omg . How rude . I mean as a sales person that is your job to help me to see how I can get a car . I left immediately. And went to a more professional place like BMW . Where they treated me excellent and got myself a BMW without so many requirements . Don't waste your time here ,",1
545,"This is one of my favorite places at Scottsdale Quarter. They have an excellent menu, and I normally am a creature of habit, but have tried at least 5 different things here and have loved them all equally! I would recommend the fish tacos, gnocchi, and the short rib pasta. Yum!",5
546,This hideaway is a best kept secret.  I been going here for over a year and the food is ALWAYS DELICIOUS.  The Ribs are #1 hands down.  I Luv the homemade barbecue sauce.  This is a keeper!!,5
547,"been there a few times,  was not bad the first time I went.  only complaint I had was  their was more side dish than main course.  So I felt like I was getting a sample of the main dish (curry chicken, goat, etc) while paying full price.  

went again and didn't even finish my meal.  I guess they were having an off day with the flavor. So I'll be looking for another restaurant soon.",1
548,"I go out of my way to eat here. The food, service, prices and ambiance are all top notch. The drinks are strong too and brunch is a definite DO here if you're fond of spicy food... If you're not overly fond of spicy beware the smaller salsas they hand you with chips. Taste sooo good but hurt sooooo bad. Wow.",5
549,"We won't be going back again. This is our second visit and while the first was not amazing, this time was truly horrible. We ordered a salad to start. 3 bites into the salad and the entrees show up... so much for our salad. One bite of the chicken saltimbocca proved that it was made ahead or purchased and then frozen and reheated. The artichoke hearts were obviously canned and tough. It was awful and it was promptly returned. The spaghetti and meat sauce was passable but I did not try the meatballs my daughter ordered. The were so huge and dense, I can't imagine they tasted good, let alone the texture. We ordered the chocolate ""lava"" cake and it came so dry that all we ate was the middle and the ice cream on top.. microwaved for sure! When I confronted the manager and said that I thought he overused ""chef mike"" he knew EXACTLY what I meant and smiled, but did not deny it. Chef mike in the land of chefs is the mircowave... a HUGE no no in any professional kitchen that cares at all about the quality of their food... the biggest waste of $75 in recent memory... stay away!!!

550,"I don't get the allure of this place at all. I'm personally not a fan of high quantity accomplished through sacrificing quality. We came here because my husband wanted something unhealthy and fried, but we should have used up those calories somewhere else. I had the chicken and waffles, and although the plate looked like a spectacle... being a spectacle is not always a good thing. I would only come back here if I was being dragged to it by tourists who use the moniker ""foodie"" too freely. Their cocktail mixes are pretty good, but again, more focused on looking good rather than actually tasting good. If I'm going to eat unhealthy, I'd rather go to Raising Canes BJs, Cheesecake Factory... anywhere else really.",1

Since I still had a nagging issue, Thick decided to upgrade my drivetrain components at zero cost, not because I asked them to, but because that's how much they care about their customers.",5

556,"The saying "" it's too good to be true"" definitely applies here. We sat through the time share talk last year and chose this location for our free weekend. I got the sense there is some sort of list of those there for a free weekend as we were pretty much on the discard list while we saw many others who were seemingly  owners treated much better. We booked the weekend in a suite for four guests as we told them we were with our children. We drove from Los Angeles and after sitting in terrible traffic arrived at 11 pm. Our young children were exhausted. After checking in we were sent to the guest services representative that held our parking permit hostage. She started in with the "" sell"" and when we explained we really needed to go upstairs as our kids were falling asleep she acted offended and said "" well I'm not done telling you about the resort"" when we got to the room the living room with the pull out couch was so small we had to move all furniture to the perimeter of the room to open the bed. It was not made up. There were NO blankets in the room. None. Two total towels for four people. Every time we called down to ask for these items we had quite a long wait. On our second night we came into the lobby to someone sleeping on the couch or passed out there. We asked for a late check out when we arrived and were told to call back Saturday night or Sunday morning. Regular check out was 10am. We called to ask for an extra hour and got a very clipped "" no we will charge you $35 an hour"" the staff was less than accommodating and certainly did not make us feel they wanted us to purchase a time share. We left feeling like we wouldn't go back to a Wyndham property if you paid us. It was not relaxing to hear people talking about their sale and percentages wherever we went. There were no umbrellas at the pool. No umbrellas at a pool in Vegas???? There was a seedy element here and I'd never return.",1
557,"I stumbled upon this lovely coffee place on my way to the garage. I had a 12oz espresso with milk (aka cappuccino) and it tasted amazing! It was perfectly smooth unctuous and not bitter. I added a little bit of sugar, but soon realized I could of had it as is! It cost me $4 and it was absolutely worth it. The staff was lovely and not rushing clients. They also sale sweets to go with your tea/coffee. Word of caution not to miss out, it's cash only.",5
558,"Good lord, I thought this was a hotel, not a white trash penal colony.  Well, ok, in all fairness, it is not just a white trash penal colony, because it is full of trash of all races, creeds, and colors.  

But, in complete honesty, if the human race had a trash can, it would be this dump.  

I am, right now, in a ""non smoking"" room, that smells like the rugs were shampooed with chewing tobacco.   Or, maybe I just smell it from the next room, because the walls are so thin that you can hear a dog fart through them.  

Walking through the lobby, it looks like a frigging zombie movie.  That movie ""Leaving Las Vegas"" should have been filmed here, because being here makes ME want to drink myself to death with a hooker.  

There are two reasons to stay here:  1)  There is a blizzard coming, it is unsafe to be outside, and you are on foot, with no shoes, and you'll die before you get to other shelter, 2) you're trash and you want to be with the other trash.  

Holy crap.  Get me out of this frigging dump.",1

563,"i was not pleased with the place. my husband passed away just before christmas. after arrangements were made and paid for, i couldnt get the actual office on the phone. i kept getting their answering service. when i was finally called to pick up my husbands ashes, they had put him in the wrong urn. had his date of death wrong on the label they put on the urn. they didnt even have the prayer cards ready. they started printing them after i got there to pick him up. i understand businesses are closed for holidays. thats not even my problem. my problem was they give you a card and tell you to call anytime with any questions.when i call their answering service tells me they are closed for renovations so please call back monday.  then they dont answer their phones. and they dont return their calls.i called six times in the next two weeks and only got the actual office one time and the guy that answered put me on hold and hung up on me.  they also dont check their own paperwork before giving you the ok to pick up what you are picking up. there was a copy of the urn i ordered in my husbands file they had. the only thing the wrong urn had in common with the one i ordered was that it was square and made out of wood.  i will never go to them again for anything. they may be cheaper then most other places but there is a reason for that. even after their ""renovations"" there place is still a dump. the people that work there are very insensitive. they deal with the dead everyday. i dont. i have never had to do anything like this before. when i call i deserve to have my call returned. if not that same day, then the next morning. 

if you can possibly pick a different place to deal with then do it. this place is not worth the aggravation you have to deal with at the worst time in your life.",1

Each mani and pedi comes with a great massage and thorough exfoliation.

The staff aren't chatty, which suits me just fine, particularly since there's always some charming movie on the TV screens.

They are also very clean - all metal equipment is sterilized and comes in individual packs so that it remains sanitary.

I have never seen anything that has made me uncomfortable about the hygiene.

I have moved to another neighbourhood and haven't found another place that comes even close, so I plan ahead and get to Joy every time I need my nails done!",5
568,"Dr. Carruth and staff are terrific.  A sole building, so no hassle with big medical building/parking decks.  Information received prior to the procedure, on-line information is excellent.  Seems impossible to not be prepared unless one doesn't read the information. The office staff, assistant, PA and Dr. Carruth explain everything (without being patronizing), and are respectful and professional. My husband detests going to any doctor, and Dr. Carruth won him over. My only unhappy part is the TV room (near procedure rooms), and the waiting room with a TV are the only family waiting options. It would be nice to have a NO TV waiting area (or at least one on mute). We are not TV watchers and find it irritating. Otherwise I understand why Dr. Carruth was recommended to us by doctors and friends, and we will certainly recommend him to others.",5
569,"I bought a set of tire from discount about 14 months ago for my wife's '99 SL500. When I went in this week for their rotation they told me they could not rotate the tire because the front tires were worn off on both sides below the wear points. This was due to the fact that they set the air pressures to low in those tire. They only had 14lbs of pressure in them, and they should have been at 30lbs. The tires were rates for 60K miles, but they only had about 10k on them. The new set they put on the rear had 24lbs in them, and they looked fine,  but they should have been at 35lbs. Discount would not stand behind their failed work. 

They are the ones who set those pressures wrong, but I could not prove that fact. They tried to say the chrome on my rims was delaminating inside, and that was causing them to lose pressure. That was total BS, because both front and back tires had matching pressures on either side.  I'll be finding a new tire store next time after this.",1
572,"My husband and I came here for an early dinner on April 25th and we both enjoyed their food and most especially their service. I forgot our server's name but she was very knowledgeable about their menu, friendly personality and very accommodating. 
I was a little disappointed because they took out the mussels on their updated menu.
But nonetheless, I tried their French Pot Roast for the first time and I really liked it---a recommendation from our amazing server. The meat was really soft, the sauce was not salty and was seasoned well, it went very well with the mashed potatoes. 
Again, when you experience a great service, it changes everything.",5
574,The food and service were absolutely amazing!  It was also a nice change of music :) definitely recommend the ribeye!!,5
575,"35+ years of patronizing Roberto's in San Diego and in Las Vegas is now finished. Why?  Roberto, you can thank your employees at the shop located on Cactus (just East of So. Highlands Parkway), in Las Vegas. 

Earlier this month (March, 2015) while waiting for my food, a female employee began vigorously sweeping the entry rug located INSIDE the front door.  She swept in the direction of the condiment island and the service counter, all the while oblivious to the cloud of dust she was creating in the room. In a matter of seconds, the entire room was engulfed in dust.  It was so bad, in fact, that I was compelled to go outside, where I could breathe. 

Not only did the dust settle on the condiment cart and its contents, but it migrated into the kitchen where my food was being prepared. NOTHING was said by any employee about the dust cloud as it lingered in the kitchen AND SETTLED ON MY FOOD. It was DISGUSTING! DISGUSTING DISGUSTING!

This experience has led to my loss of confidence and trust in the cleanliness of Roberto's shop and the safe preparation of food at this location. It has also caused me to doubt the manner in which Roberto's other shops are being operated. 

Hasta la vista Roberto!",1
576,"Could this place be any cuter?  Seriously, what an amazing new place - great atmosphere, friendly staff and an absolutely tasty London Fog = perfection!  I can't wait to come back and try some other drinks and buy some of the luxe sugar cubes too - beautiful and such a nice gift for my tea loving friends.",5
578,This place was not opened. I went at 4pm on Monday (today) in search of their bionicos but it was not open. I tried calling too but no answer. They should have a sign saying closed.,1
579,They always do it right here. Feeling of family on the strip is usually non existant but the team here makes it happen.  I dont know why I always eat the wasabi peanuts that make my head explode but I always come back for more. The valet team is amazing always remember me and are quick with getting my car. Very highly recommended to anyone visiting the first or fiftieth time!,5
581,"Wendy's Noodle Cafe - always excellent food.
We called in for special occasion with family and ordered Crab & Lobster Chefs special dish. We had to order before hand for these dishes, did not disappoint just like Wendy's special pan-fried rice cake & fried chicken wings. Sooooooo good.
Recommend to anyone who wants authentic Hong Kong style home cooking.",5
582,"Good location my friends used to live there,  but for what your paying the units are way too small. and lousy carpeting, very low end appliances, old and poorly functioning washer and dryers and refrigerators.  No storage space anywhere in the units, rooms are small. living rooms too small and the water and trash used to be included now they are charging their tenants a flat fee which should be illegal.  Its called Ratio billing and their water waste due to broken and poorly functioning irrigation and sprinkler systems is not the tenants fault.  The group that owns this complex also owns a few other properties in the area.  My advice stay away do your homework youll be much happier in the long run.  You can tell by driving through there that half the complex is vacant ask yourself why such a prime location would be 50% vacant, not rocket science, you probably arent getting what you pay for.  The property manager while she attempts to act friendly always sounds pissed off with attitude, not sure what her problem is. I would probably rate it 2 or 3 stars if the units were priced appropriately for the condition and size, obviously they cant make them bigger so you have to adjust prices",1
583,"Just mad at myself for waiting so long to try this spot. We went on the Friday of Valentine's weekend without reservations, and had no issue with waiting 15 minutes to be seated. The server was very attentive (sorry for forgetting his name) throughout our meal, and we split an appetizer and each had a pasta entree. Food was piping hot and not from a heat lamp (huge plus), and portions were such that a bunch came home with us. Will absolutely return and bring visiting friends and family.",5
584,I called Christmas day for my Mother who had been broke down and stranded on the highway. After giving the gentleman I spoke with on the phone her information he informed me that they would take her car to my house for free.

585,"Simple tucked away little place with exceptional sushi. Attentive but not hovering staff, the right sized menu selection, and quality cuts of fish. When I hear about Montreal's cuisine, it's usually about French food, fatty cuts of pork, duck confit, foie gras, etc. I never thought to look up a sushi place, but the urge hit us so we went to the highest rated place around us. I didn't know what the expect with the Sapin de Noel (x-mas tree) but was surprised by how much flavor was tucked into these little things! They went perfectly with a tiny bit of the creamy sauce they provide on the side and a dab of soy sauce.",5

587,"The massage was good for $25 per hour.  I would have given 4 stars but the owner/manager required us to pay  $10 for tip for the masseuse.  We told him he never told us that there was a required $10 tip!  He just smiled like a sneaky devious bastard while the masseuse awaits for her tip.  I felt bad for the masseuse so I end up giving her $10.  At the end, I just felt ripped off by the owner/manager.",1
589,"CRAZY FUN!!

I had a blast it was a Tuesday and of course the family has about 4 women who wanted to go shooting so we came back on that day and it was FREE!

The wait was an hour, so we had time to kill and drove down the way and had lunch, but we got back and we were good to go. We rented 2 ""lanes"" or whatever their called. One for small hand guns and the other for big rifles. Both my cousins own those guns, not sure if this place rents guns or not. Our group was about 9 people, only 3 people at a time can enter.

Having never been to a shooting range, it was quite intimidating, my bad for starting with the rifle because it scared the s*** out of me. 308 caliber, that thing was a monster. But once I got over that ""fear"" I was good to go. My sister and I are both pretty petite but we took turns with the boys and it was super fun!!

The staff is super friendly and are laughs. They are really helpful and BS'd a lot with my mom and dad who were waiting by the counter to go back in and shoot. We were there for about 2 hours everyone got their turns and we had a little competition. The sucky part is, I left my target sheet at my aunts house :(.

Anyhoo, super fun I bought a t-shirt to remember the experience, great beginning to my  xmas vacation in AZ.",5
591,"This family run locals spot is a gem!
Nothing at all like the Hawaiian barbecue chains with boring mayo noodles and canned brown gravy on frozen fries.  This is home cooked island fare with a touch of love and happiness....in a portion large enough to put you in a coma!

I've actually converted 2 Hawaiian barbecue nay-sayers in their 1st visit here.

Mmmmmm summarizes.",5

607,"This place is a hidden gem. My husband and I love British food and this is the place to go if you're looking for it. We ordered the Oven Chips as a starter and they were amazing. Great taste, crisp and fresh. We ordered the Porky and the Shepard's Pie pasty's and both were phenomenal. The portions are huge, and everything was so tasty! Great taste, really amazing food. The atmosphere is very nice and they have a great selection of beer on tap. We will be back!",5
608,"Love this place! I've been here a couple of times over the years and it has never disappointed. The arancini di riso appetizer, stuffed eggplant entree, filet mignon entree and duck entree are all amazing. I've also had the lemon cheesecake and creme brulee and they were also amazing! The cheesecake was more fluffy then dense which was a nice change. Highly recommend this place!",5
609,"Best paint job and experience!  Jeff came out and gave me an estimate and I am so happy I hired them to paint the exterior of my house. I don't say this about a lot of people but I feel Jeff is straightforward, honest and has high integrity.  His painters were on time, worked very hard, and did an excellent job.  They did such a good job I had them come back and paint the interior of my house and I was very pleased again.   

I would highly recommend Action Painting to anyone who wants to hire a good all around painting Company.",5
610,"As an employee at In-N-Out, I thought that nothing would compare to my usually Double-Double. However, Habit Burger has changed the game. When I first walked in, I noticed that the restaurant was very open so I could see everything going on in the back. The onion rings were fantastic, and the bacon on the BBQ Bacon Char Burger was extraordinary. Another positive for me was the great music choice. I don't know what station it was but they were playing great throwbacks. Overall, it was a fantastic experience.",5
613,"Ti has been my stylist for over a year.  At the time I found her, I was new to Arizona and had no idea where to go. Found her at her previously salon and followed her here to Lifespa. Ti is absolutely worth following and trying out if you're looking for a stylist!  She is amazingly talented with color, cuts, styling...you name it.  When I first started going to Ti, she took the time to listen and really understand my style. She genuinely loves what she does and it shows in her work!  What I also really appreciate about Ti is she takes the time to educate on styling as well as gives product tips making it easy for me to replicate the style at home.  She is friendly and welcoming and always delivers exceptional service!",5

618,"I am absolutely agreeing with the lady Alissa M who had a terrible experience with these very unprofessional people. I took my mother there as she is 89 and has terrible hot burning feet at night and gets no sleep, they told her that they have a machine that has worked for others with that problem, so she tried it out at their office and she bought one for $400.00. It was a lot for her to pay out with such a limited income, but was so hopeful that it would work. After about the 3rd day her feet were worse and she was in worse shape than before she got this machine. So she called them and the woman told her to use it twice a day for 30 days and she should be good, so back on the machine she went and it got so bad that her feet were burning all day and all night, so called the office again, and the woman actually told her that if it is not working for her ""Maybe you better put it on Kijiji and try to sell it for $200.00 or whatever you can get for it as we do not do refunds""
If you deal with these people do so at your own risk!!",1

621,"I have nothing but good to say about this salon! 
I recently moved here about a year ago and I was petrified to find a new salon and have a total stranger messing with my hair.. Long story short my bangs got severely damaged from flat ironing, and swimming in a chlorine pool a lot, they were crunchy and felt like straw. I HAD to go in to get them trimmed and treated.
I came into Design me for the Opalex treatment on just my bangs to help repair some of the damage and get a trim up on them. Zoey was my stylist and I am so happy with the way my bangs turned out! I've always cut them myself because no one had ever gotten them perfect but she took her time and made sure they were even and they turned out absolutely perfect! 
The Opalex treatment is great! Better used with the take home product as well, to keep the damage from getting worse on its own. 
The salon is beautiful, very relaxing environment and everyone is so nice! I had no problem booking an appointment a couple days out, they had lots of room! 
This is my go to salon now and I couldn't be more happy that I came here :)",5

632,He was inattentive and just wanted to get even more cash from you on top of your Groupon. He also gave unrealistic expectations and informed me that I could eat or drink any color food after treatment. He's just after money. I won't be returning.,1
633,"It is really bad experience. The equipment is so old and looks dirty. The owner was the only one there. She did not use plastic liner. We told her it was going to be two people the same time and she said ok, but it turned out she did both of ours and we had to wait for each other. And because of that, she tried to cut corners to save time. I had to offer to cut my nails right for her. You just don't find anything professional in this place. I am so so so regret that I wasted my time and money. Well. Never go back again!",1
635,"Very speedy turnaround, excellent service, great prices (we compared with 2 other places), and excellent craftsmanship.

We had a difficult job - stonework fireplace and weird angles that required extreme attention to detail and quality work. They far exceeded our expectations.

Additionally, I had a really difficult time selecting the carpet color for another room. Tory worked with me for over two hours without rushing me. He showed extreme patience and understood that this is an investment that requires consideration. 

Highly recommend Flooring America!",5
636,"This is kind of a hidden gem and I'm hoping not EVERYONE is going to go to. The price is kinda pricey but it is totally worth it. There's never a waiting line and the place is kind of small and cozy. I was here on a nice date and the service was absolutely amazing. Japanese people are the best!! The sushi was absolutely delicious. Almost above par because of how fresh the fish is.

Their lunch boxes are definitely affordable and we went to try their love boat which was around $70-80 for around (65 pcs). Isn't bad for a place like this. I loved their spicy salmon roll. 

I'd come again (very soon actually)! ;)",5

I ended up calling them on a Wednesday and they said they had me scheduled for Monday and were not going to call until the Friday before. I explained I worked full-time and would've needed more notice.  So I still proceeded to try to make the Monday appointment work.  They agreed to schedule my appointment for either early Monday or Late Monday. Friday rolled around and I had to call again and was told my appointment was for smack dab in the middle of the day- 12:45pm.  It was ridiculous. And they were so un-apologetically lazy about the whole situation. I asked if I would've been treated this way had I not been using a Living Social-- their response, no. 

 I ended up just getting a refund from Living Social.

The hassle and lack of customer service was not worth the deal.",1

I call the billing number listed and they want some type of number that I do not have but the pre-recorded voice does not allow me to get assistance.  Then I finally get through to a line and they are closed from noon to 1p.  DO YOU WANT MY FREAKING MONEY OR NOT????  WHAT A JOKE.  NOT GOING BACK just because of the hassle factor.  The phlebotomists and service at the centers are great, but obviously the billing department leadership does not have a clue.",1
644,"From the moment I walked into the restaurant to the moment i left, I felt the food and the service lacked passion. The gentleman taking the order was very monotone and it seemed like the staff just got out of a meeting where everyone got in trouble. I ordered the meatball sub and a pepperoni pizza. The food came out within 10 minutes which was great but when i took a bite of the meatball sub and the pizza, It was bland. It needed salt and pepper. I will not be returning to this place.",1
647,"This place makes GREAT General Tao Chicken. It's honestly some of the best I've ever had. Sweet and tangy and sort of crunchy/soft. 

I came in with my parents after a long day of Christmas Shopping and we were ravenous. We ordered one meal each. (We also got pork and lamb but I forgot the names of the dishes:( )
Service was super fast, the food was served within 15-20 minutes of us placing the order.
The portions are also really big. 3 meals and a medium sized bowl of rice and we were done for. We barely finished everything. 

It's a super low key place, I always walk by it when I'm at school and sometimes I forget it's there. The restaurant is down a flight of stairs and the exterior is really faded and looks like a store.

The one weird thing is they used to have a huge menu but recently they've crossed out a bunch of options so the menu is very scribbled on and it's hard to tell what's being served and what isn't.",5
648,"Here's my experience with Naima. My sister is getting married and we found a couple of makeup artist in the area. We found Naima and decided to do a makeup trial even though she had mixed reviews  online. So we went to her ""studio""  which is someone's basement. (Let's ignore how awkward that was.) And the first thing I noticed was how unorganized and messy her makeup area was. It literally looked like there was an explosion. Makeup on top of makeup. Products on top of products. Completely unprofessional. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and ignored it. But then she started her makeup. I noticed Naima was using dirty brushes on my sister. I was going to gag because it was so gross but I kept my mouth shut. I was honestly worried my sister was going to break out or have some sort of skin reaction, she took off the makeup immediately after leaving the trail!!Also noticed that Naima was using low to mid drug store products, she wasn't using luxury or high end products which is odd because the price she was asking for you would expect everything to be top notch. Anyways she did her makeup trial and it took Naima 5 hours (just makeup not hair) even though we told her we needed to be done at a certain time because we drove almost 2 hours to get to her. Overall we were not impressed with the makeup look. It was so standard with gold glitter and such a traditional basic desi look. Honest critic because I do makeup. The contour was off, eyebrows were overly drawn, way too much eyeliner at the bottom which made eyes look sunken, and winged liner was NOT on point!  Your average MAC / Sephora makeup artist can do better and are probably in a lower price and much more sanitary! 
Obviously we ended up not hiring her for the wedding. Looking at some of these reviews, I think it was a good decision. Would not recommend her at all! Just my honest review!",1
649,"Do not drive past this one place! It's very unassuming from the outside but the quality & freshness of the sushi is comparable, if not better than anything on the strip. At a fraction of the price. 

Sat at the sushi bar & was served by Chef Oscar. The care and expertise he used to slice & create was awesome to watch. The pride he has of his craft was obvious. Check out the sashimi platter picture. That's Golden Eye Snapper adorning that platter. 

Besides eating with your eyes, the taste did not disappoint! Totally fresh, great cuts of fish. Chef Oscar added a bit of roe here, a little uni there to completely elevate the nigiri. Didn't skimp on the thickness of the sashimi, either. 

Great meal, fantastic value, fun experience. What more do you want?",5

I prepaid the first month and a week later the owner called me looking for a payment... across the board this is the worst run business I've ever come in contact with and I'm happy to be out..

I had gone twice before this last experience for a pedicure and each time someone had my cuticle bleeding. Tried again (stupid) 4 weeks ago for a pedicure. The man with the ponytail and false teeth helped me. He was using the cheese grater on my heel when I said ""ouch"" and he said ""sorry"". He had taken a CHUNK out of my heel. He put some kind of liqiud on the spot and finished up the pedicure. I then told him that my heel was still bleeding. He put something else on it and a bandaid. As I said, that was 4 weeks ago today and I am just now able to wear tennis shoes to take the dogs for a walk and use the treadmill. I still have a scab on my heel but I don't have to roll up my jeans anymore to keep them from hitting my heel.

She was not at all accommodating and we came out disappointed. Infact, decided not to go ahead with third haircut too. Never again with that lady.",1
678,"Worst club ever. Don't go, if you do get a manager to figure out the rates: good girls nice place, try to dup out of towers, but I am almost local and they asked if I want to call the cops and I said ok, they buckled. Do not go here, they charged each person for the same round . Shady and girls are just ok.",1
680,Very Efficient and great customer service through my inquiring through yelp from Pete to on the phone and the service guy Richard that came out. Very please with the service received and how quick and easy it was. Also great pricing! Will definitely refer and keep you in mind.,5
681,Amazing wings! They have a cool little pool table to play. My fianc√© and I go there for lunch on occasion away from our kids to have a mini date and we have a beer and 10 piece wings and we have a blast! Great customer service!,5
682,"I went here for new years eve dinner with my parents and my fiance. It was a prix fixe menu for 70 dollars that came to over 90 including tax and tip...before wine. 

There was one vegetarian choice per course, which is expected and totally fine when it is 3-4 choices per course. The vegetarian choices sounded good and I was really excited before going. 

So, the first course was a caprese salad with one very generous slab of Buffalo mozzarella, one slice of red tomato (a vine tomato I think), and one slice of yellow tomato. The tomatoes weren't great, but it is winter and they're out of season. The dressing was a flavorless olive oil and thin balsamic vinegar, and one leaf of basil. It was okay but would have been greatly improved by smoking the tomatoes, or infusing the oil, or even just using a high quality flavourful olive oil...or more basil. Or even slicing the cheese thinner.

Second course was ""crispy ricotta gnocchi."" This was where it really fell apart. They were battered and over cooked so it was just like hollow, deep fried batter, none of the tender pillows of ricotta gnocchi I'm used to with this dish. It was also over salted and just incredibly greasy...this coming from someone who loves salty french fries or onion rings. I couldn't finish them. The portion was also ridiculously small (I know gnocchi is always a smaller portion but these were mini gnocchi and only came as 8-10 pearl sized balls of grease) and I was really jealous of my non vegetarian dining partners who had plates of fresh pasta, but again, I couldn't finish them anyway. 

I was really looking forward to the third course, risotto funghi, with 4 kinds of mushrooms, because I love mushrooms and was really hungry and already disappointed in the meal. Unfortunately it was the worst course of the night for me. It tasted like campbells mushroom soup that someone had added *extra* salt too. There were clumps of the rice stuck together. The different mushrooms which I picked out all tasted exactly the same, with the same texture, as they'd been overcooked in this mess. There was one whole clove of garlic, but the garlic flavours hadn't penetrated the rest of the dish. It was seriously awful, and my whole table agreed it was inedible. I was really jealous of the sides everyone else's meals came with, like wilted greens. They said theirs was okay but the steaks they request medium rare were unevenly cooked and medium well done that medium rare. There were some generous slices of parmesan on top of the risotto though, and that was the highlight of my meal. 

It isn't like me to not be able to eat my food. I've been to many amazing Italian restaurants in Toronto, Italy, and other countries. I also eat at malls and cafeterias and 7-11. This food wouldn't have been good even if I were drunk (and I did get drunk on all the wine, since I was on an empty stomach as the food they served me was inedible). 

Everyone else enjoyed their food, but were a little disappointed as nothing was outstanding or particularly good quality. It seemed to be a case of them not caring about vegetarian food at all, or maybe their chefs don't know how to work with flavours other than just using meat. The over salting was really jarring. I love salt, but this was disgusting.

Overall, it was one of the very worst meals I have ever been served and the price was outrageous for something I'd be angry and being served at a local pub.

(also, I'm not sure how to change my profile but I'm no longer vegan, heh)",1
683,"We loved this place, I had the shoyu chicken and my husband had beef ribs both dishes were onolicious, very large portionsand the poke was winnas, .  We will be back in April to try the desserts.",5
685,Worst service. We made reservations and still had to wait 20 min to be seated. Food was ok but it was delayed and we missed part of the game. All I heard was oh we are backed up. Don't go there before games. We waited 35 min for bill and it still was wrong. Disappointing experience.,1
689,"Came here on a Sunday morning for brunch. There was a long line, but it went by quickly. We had a delicious breakfast here. The croissant french toast is a MUST ORDER! This was our favorite part of the meal, hands down. Additionally, the pancakes are extremely light and fluffy, would recommend. 

Will be back here for sure next time I'm in Vegas.",5
691,Two waitresses and a room full of customers. One was talking to a gentleman dining by himself for almost the whole time we were there for our food. And the poor other girl did her best. The rolls were the same from one to another. Couldn't taste variety even though that's what I ordered. I can't recommend this place at all.,1
692,Wow really surprised the seafood was excellent the lobster bisque was delicious and full of lobster meat we had the Halibut Alexander style with gulf shrimp and diver scallops was delicious the soy ginger sauce with spinach really complimented the dish yum.,5
693,A surprisingly extensive list of good beers brewed in-house and some excellent food to pair it with. Delicious!,5
695,"The food was really really good. I got a breakfast item and enjoyed every bite. 

The service was a tiny bit iffy but I was with a large group of people so think that's what influenced it. 

The large group ordered pretty much everything on the menu and only one person out of the group had anything less than glowing to say about the food. I would totally go back!",5
696,"I have been seeing Dr Toni Vaughn (for acupuncture) and Margie (for massage) at the AIM Center for a few months now.  All I can say is that, this place rocks.  The attention that you receive as a patient is second to none.  

Dr. Toni is completely thorough and caring.  When you see her, she treats you like a friend, makes you feel comfortable, and really cares about your well-being.  On my first visit, we talked for 2 hours about my medical history and health goals.  I have never had an experience like this with any other physician.  

Margie is the best massage therapist that I have ever dealt with.  She is also extremely caring (hugs included).  The work that she performs is amazing, and she takes the time to show you activities to perform at home that will help with pain and stress in the body.  

Chandra, the office manager, has an ""on-your-side"" approach when it comes to dealing with insurance.  She is completely competent in what she does and has such a friendly demeanor, which is rare in a physician's office.  

Before going to the AIM Center, I didn't have much experience with naturopathic medicine, and now I am hooked.  I strongly recommend the AIM Center for those with an interest in naturopathic healing and total mind, body, and soul wellness.  You will not be disappointed here.",5
697,Great addition to the East End! Will be returning frequently for a tasty meal on the go :),5
700,We went to Auditorium 2.  Very ordinary seats which resembled me of theatres 20 years ago. The most horrible part was the overpowering smell due to non-maintenance and probably bedbugs.  May not be going again.,1
701,"Awesome experience. I met this amazing guy behind the counter named Jorge gave me exceptional service, beyond his kindness and genuine charisma he gave me amazing life advice that led me to later to go a bank of America and open an account.

705,"WOW, $65 to check the air in your RV tires?!!  We took the RV in for a couple of repairs as we usually do here in Vegas when we go through.  This time we feel we were taken advantage of.  It was $65 to tell us how to use the wiper switch correctly, a $65 fee to fix the shade which was fair, but the $65 to check air in 6 tires was over the top to stick it to a yearly returning customer.  Adios Findlay, there are other places here that would like our business.  We got better odds at the gambling table!",1
706,"Been here, stayed here, and eaten here before and loved it. This last visit, not so much. 

Went to the M Life Counter to try and redeem MyVegas points early in the morning for breakfast. Upon arriving, with our kids, the wife went off to the side just barely visible to me and not close to any of the machines. Since there was no lines, I was immediately told any MyVegas rewards are not usable during Christmas since it was blacked out. 

I was disappointed, but I get that.  What I don't get, is the person on the floor and immediately told my wife and kids to leave since they are underage. Sure, I get that minors should not be allowed on the floor and it's not legal. But since I barely paused for a second to ask the hostess and was rudely told by the gentleman to leave before I can barely finish hearing my vouchers were not valid.....that was totally uncalled for. 

Sometimes, it's not what you say, it's how you say it...and this time, it could've been told and handled differently.  It didn't sit well with me and I didn't get a chance to voice my concern. So let me tell my fellow Yelpers to please consider twice before coming here if you want to be taken care of.  There are plenty of better options.",1

710,"A class service, C class food.  Sushi section was of questionable quality and freshness.  Other sections were average at best.  Only redeeming points were no lineup and fast service.  Not really worth the pricepoint since it seems like they've removed some menu items to cut costs.

Update - upon returning home I suffered from food poisoning for half a week.  Emailed management but received no reply.  If you are forced to dine here I would recommend avoiding the sushi section entirely since they leave eaw fish out for long periods of time.",1
712,Great atmosphere and energy. Food is just fantastic. There seriously wasnt a single thing which I didn't think was above par. Even the draft Ashai was perfectly chilled. Will come here everything in town.,5

I for one along with many other people will not go anywhere els. And I don't even live In the area.

725,"I found Lovetts when I was looking for a collision repair shop close to home. My insurance company sent me a list of 'preferred' shops and they all had less than stellar reviews. Seeing the wonderful feedback on line about Lovetts, I decided to give them a shop. 

From my 1st phone call, they were a pleasure to deal with. They answered any and all questions, contacted my insurance company when the initial estimate did not fully cover the damages, arranged for additional inspection, & handled the financials directly with my insurance. They called to keep me updated when my car needed additional days in the shop. They even fully explained to me how Hertz works to pick up/drop off rentals at their shop. 

When my car was ready, they informed me that my battery had died while in the shop. They jump started it every day to move it when they worked on it. I wasn't surprised, as it had never been replaced in the 5 years I owned the car & I'd seen some telltale signs that it might be failing. They very kindly offered to get the battery & install it by the time I came to get my car that afternoon, saying that they didn't want me to drive down the road, only to have it die. They even provided me with the invoice, showing what they paid and giving me proof of purchase for warranty replacement if needed. I'll just say that sourcing my particular battery was quite the chore, but they came through and installed it. 

When I got there, one of their wonderful guys had my trunk popped open and was putting a covering back on the inside. He noticed that my license plate light was out, so he took it uppon himself to pop a new one in. So awesome! 

My car was washed & sparkly clean. The repair work was stellar. I really felt taken care of & like they cared about doing great job. I will absolutely use them again & would send any of my friends and family to them. 

Thanks Lovetts!",5
726,"Thanks yet again to the Yelp app for finding my lunch.  I typed in ""soul food,"" and this place appeared.  It had half a dozen glowing reviews, so we decided to give it a shot.  Very glad we did.  Angie is very friendly, I stopped by before we ate and got a to go menu.  She advised me to call and order what we wanted, as the food is cooked to order, and it is not quick.  This is totally fine with me, I find that generally, the quicker stuff is, the less ""real"" it is.  And usually, the better it tastes when it takes some time to cook.

There are some mainstays on the menu (fried or smothered chicken, for example), and there are daily specials.  We ate at Angie's on a Thursday, when meatloaf is the special.  So, my wife had meatloaf.  This is a traditional meatloaf, tomato sauce, onions, veggies.  Very moist, went well with the mashed potatoes and brown gravy.  We also tried mac n cheese, fried corn, and okra.  Of these, the okra was my least favorite, but I still really liked it.  The fried corn has bacon and veggies in it, it was a style we hadn't tried before.  Both of us liked it.  I'd like to try to replicate this dish at home.  The mac n cheese, as expected, was fantastic.  Classic soul food mac, not based on a roux.  Very cheesy.  

I had the fried chicken.  I was glad I called ahead, because this dish can take 25-30 minutes.  Again, I don't mind since it's fresh, but I highly recommend you call first.  This is a LARGE serving of chicken, 4 pieces, with 2 very large drumsticks.  Both meals at $9.99 for the entr√©e, 2 sides, and cornbread.  Very reasonable considering the flavor and quality of what you get.  The fried chicken was seasoned very well.  I find that a lot of places are too focused on the skin, which is certainly important, and leave out proper seasoning.  Not Angie.  The skin was crispy, adhered to the chicken, and was flavorful.  That's the fried chicken trifecta.

The employees were very friendly.  The place is small and sparsely decorated, but we felt very comfortable.  This is some serious soul food, highly recommended.",5
728,"5 stars for the food. 0 for the service. Literally the best Mongolian beef I've ever had. However, it was also literally the worst service I've ever had. I will never eat inside the restaurant again. The waitress actually sighed out loud when I asked for some hot mustard. Never checked back after that and dropped off my bill before I even started my main dish. I watched her pick up a check from another table before they left and she asked why no tip. They pointed to the cash on the table and then picked  it up and walked out. I was blown away by how much this person hated her job. Not once did she smile or make me feel like a guest. Instead I felt as though I had been trespassing.  First time I ever stiffed a waitress.",1
729,"This location has been open for over two years and they can't get it together. It is like they are constantly training people and never quite have the hang of it. Drive thru is a nightmare and you must pull over and wait for your food. Half the time you have to go in to get your own food. Today's wait was 13 minutes for a breakfast sandwich, meanwhile 6 other cars passed through, all the while receiving their breakfast sandwiches or bagels. I stood inside and watched what went out while I continued to wait for my food.",1
730,"Brokers are supposed to work for the paying customer not screw them over. Called this company when I was told they had great customer service and they really help the customers out.

They had no problems taking my money but when it came time to file a claim due to a break in they said The only covered they gave me was the bare bones liability covereage, When comparing prices informed them what was needed, and there prices they were comparing with was a full coverage deal, Liability, theft damage and all with inventory. 

All the ovner can say is that"" you didnt read the policy before I signed it"".

I informed him that when I discuss a policy with a broker and he is matching other policys with same terms, and we agree apon issues, that what I thought I was signing, not some Bait and switch,

So why spoil a good thing and I had the same thing.  I told him the one thing I would have changed from my review on 6/14/17 was if Yelp offered a 10 Star I would have given him that instead of my 5 star.  Kudo's to you Chef Jeff and your lovely staff who are also incredible.  See you on my next trip!!!!,5

If you plan on doing everything, make sure you have about 6 hours open and bring your own lunch! They have tables you can eat at next to a few vending machines!

Eric, Daniel & Brawdy... I hope I got their names right.  Great guys and it was fun!  Even tho it was hot, sunscreened prevented us from getting burnt and there was a breeze so that was nice.  We were split in to 2 groups, advanced went w/ Eric and us newbies were w/ Daniel.  We stopped 3 times for pictures & water and then lunch, which was surprising good.  typical turkey or ham on a roll w/ a bag of chips but it was fresh and the roll was actually soft!

751,"This place is AMAZING! :D First of all, my bf and I don't typically like hainan chicken (usually has this weird taste that I can't explain but know that i don't like) but felt the urge to order it because of all the great reviews and they were right! The chicken was soo tender and juicy and went SUPER well with that spicy house sauce. We were actually really excited to order the fried chicken baos (basically the main reason we came here) and boyyyyyyy am I glad we did! We really wanted to come back for another order of those baos but we had such little time :(

The chef seemed super nice as he came out a few times to greet his regulars and we were only there for an hour or less sooo he's a pretty popular guy I'd say.

RULES: Order first then sit, or wait to be seated. It is a small mom/pop restaurant so be patient for their awesome foood! We waited only a few minutes but found it surprising to be full at 2:30PM.  Definitely try the hainin chicken and those fried chicken baos .. my onyl regret is not trying the fried chicken entree :(",5

Definitely somewhere to stop by when you're in the mood for some delicious, authentic Mexican food.",5

The first lady made it seem like it was inconvenient for her to deal with my order. She was impatient and completely threw out customer service. Their portions are incredibly small as well, you can tell they are greedy with how much they give to their customers. The second lady also gave attitude which was completely unnecessary. It was very frustrating for my friend and I to experience that, and would not recommend this specific location if you want Chipotle.
Just to add on, all of our orders were incorrect and completely disregarded what we actually wanted on our bowls because they were too busy being rude instead of hearing what we wanted.",1

771,"A Brazilian wax on Groupon brought me and a friend to a salon in Bethel Park. Marissa was the Esthetician and made our experience a really great one!

The procedure is quite uncomfortable, to say the least, but Marissa talked with me the whole time about school, work, relationships, etc. We were even talking about some intimate details of our lives even though we barely knew each other. But once you're bearing it all to see you kind of hit a new level of intimacy with someone upon meeting them.

Afterwards I had no ingrown hairs and the wax lasted a good six weeks. She recently moved to Sybil Salon and even sent me a text message to notify me. I never want anyone else to wax my woman parts as long as I can help it!

Thanks Marissa!",5

Not really seating inside but we stood and ate at a counter table.

779,"I passed this place at least 50 times walking along Fremont Street to the El Cortez over the past several years. Finally decided to pay a visit while staying at the El Cortez across the street. 

Once inside, I was immediately struck by the size of the place. It's at least five times larger than I imagined from passing by outside. Before this, it always seemed like the guests were crammed into the front part of the shop, surrounded by glass on two sides of the building. Whenever I walked by and peered at the coffee-slurpers, I felt like I was passing an aquarium and should drop some food inside.

But my impressions after visiting are completely different. This is a place I can't compare to any other. If I had to attempt to describe it, I'm just going to date myself. Okay so here goes: It's kind of like Record & Tape Traders meets Starbuck's meets local art gallery.

See? Half of you probably don't even know what Record & Tape Traders is. But this is good. It means you've got your youth. Please use it responsibly.

The Beat is more than just a great place to grab coffee. It's a world unto itself. Sure, there's all kinds of excellent coffee. And food. But there's also an art gallery with some truly stunning pieces of work. There's a very large upstairs, too. So don't forget that if you decide to venture into the art realms. Adding to the vibe here, there are some cool classics being piped through the speakers and vinyl albums right there in the shop. Remember those?

Staff is very upbeat, friendly and professional. One even told me I smelled good right after I placed my order. Did I? Probably. My secret? MK High Intensity Cologne. And yes I have a Mary Kay rep. But hey, what a compliment to go with your coffee. 

This is a place where laptops and tablets abound. Deals are done, Tony Hsieh of Zappos grabs his morning fix, and introductions are made several times in one morning. I only know this because I grabbed a seat at a table, fired up my laptop, and blended in with the morning crowd.

And what an eclectic crowd it is. All kinds hang out here. The well-heeled, the working class like me, and some who had clearly just stolen their ipads from someone. A tourist, no doubt. But at least they have good taste in coffee shops.

While not exactly off the beaten path, the Beat Coffeehouse is less touristy than say, the Starbuck's' or Seattle's Bests you'll find on the Strip or under the Fremont Canopy. It's more of a locals joint and a very fun place to grab your morning jolt, or even just to visit. Just one more fixture that makes downtown worth whatever it takes to get you there.",5
780,"The absolute worse customer service I've ever seen. I tried to bring a bus group to the casino but after leaving over 16 messages with 8 different people, I received not one return call. I even contacted the acting general manager who of course I didn't answer the phone either, and had his assistant to call me back only to tell me they would not be able to work with us. I wonder how an organization like this stay in business. Well, my group of 60 or more people visit Arizona every year and we have no plans on visiting the casino ever again. I'm sure the area is full of businesses and merchants who would love to have our business. I would give this business a below zero rating if possible.",1
781,"Do not take your car to this nightmare shop. I would give them zero stars if I could.  After the transmission died on my car, local tow truck driver recommended this shop.  Being new to the area, I said ""sure, take it there.""  Big mistake.

I paid close to $4,000 for a used transmission with allegedly 40k miles on it.  I asked owner for paperwork showing where he got the transmission, so that I could verify that it indeed only had that many miles.  Owner refused to provide that.  But that wasn't the worst of it.  IT TOOK THEM FOUR WEEKS TO FIX THE CAR! I tried my best to be patient with them, but every time I called it was some new story as to why they still weren't done. When their various stories started contradicting themselves, I called the owner out on it.  He then started yelling at me for accusing him and his lead technician of lying.  

But wait, it gets worse.  After finally getting my car back, the ""new"" transmission failed within two weeks! I was stranded on the side of the highway about 130 miles from home. I called the shop to ask what I should do, and they said ""go ahead and get it towed to the shop and we'll take a look."" As it turns out, they said that there was a leak in some gasket and the transmission fluid was low, so the transmission was burning up.  Wonderful.  My theory is that they forgot to refill the fluid reservoir when they put it in. Regardless, it was their fault.  I asked the owner if he would help me with the $450 tow truck bill, and he refused, despite the fact that it was his shop's incompetence that caused it and despite the fact that he had offered me a ""12,000 mile warranty.""  

So, make that $4,450 for a used transmission of dubious origins and approximately five weeks total without a car.  Mistake learned.  My only solace is that maybe this review will help someone else avoid the misery this shop brought into my life.",1
782,"Remarkable service and staff... not only are you greeted by a friendly face when you walk in the door but it continues when you step in the back. I had reservations about getting braces because I am 25 and I thought I was too old, but Dr. Jen made me feel really comfortable and I'm really glad I put my trust in her and her team. Me teeth are making great progress and every time I go in for an adjustment it just keeps getting better. I've had zero problems with my braces and I would recommend them to anyone, I myself drive from Peoria to see them. For service like this I definitely don't mind!",5

789,"We have always loved the Tuck Shop.  The ambiance, the food, the service.  Recently I made a same day reservation for five and much to my dismay, they were unable to accommodate me for the times I needed.  (My error).  They could serve us an hour later.  It was a mid week reservation, who knew they were having a few larger parties.  I begged but no way could they give me the times I wanted.  So, after a lot of back and forth they said it would be ok to come in and sit in their ""living room"" have drinks and starters.  We did that and it was such a pleasant evening as we awaited our table.  As it turned out the large party was delayed and they seated us earlier than we expected.   We ordered our food, were served timely and had a lovely evening.   The food was delicious!!!!   The wine was wonderful......as always.  Thank you to the Tuck Shop for graciously accommodating us.  Best food, owners, and staff.  You are the best.  
Always gracious.",5

Hate to cook so between dining in and take out we were going about five nights a week.The service was ok but then when I did have a problem I found out what they were really like.After  uneatable take-out (the buns were pink with blood-not good for this always well done meat eater), and non of my toppings were correct I tried to call and complain.The manger didn't even seem apologetic and said he didn't know what he could do about it.Promised to check in to it and call me back, but after waiting two days I called back and was giving the run around.Only after telling him I was going to put a review on yelp did he decide to send me two $5.00 dollar gift cards (this didn't even come close to covering the cost of my order).I'm through paying for bad food, and then them acting like I want something from them (I do but only what I paid for).So, it looks like I'm still looking for a decent place to  eat because I still hate to cook.",1

Hell, it beats the hell out of any of those chain haircutting places, ie. Supercuts, Fantasic Sams etc... Looks like I have found my new go to place with regards to getting a trim when I start to look to shaggy.",5
796,I've been coming to this club for years and recently it's really went downhill. My allergies have been really bad every time I step into the gym finally I looked up and noticed you haven't been keeping the vents cleaned in years ! Besides the filthy air vents a lot of the Equipment is busted. Just because this club is not in the wealthy neighborhood doesn't mean it shouldn't be held in the same high standards as the suburbs.,1
798,"I am a teacher in the Glendale area and I usually pack my lunch for reasons of time saving and saving money. Who can afford to eat out every day, right? Well...I am so thankful I forgot to pack my lunch today. Very happy!!
This little place is just north of the corner of 67th and Bethany Home in a non-descript little shopping mall. Once inside I was greeted by a friendly young woman and I noticed that the inside was clean and decorated with the many flags of the Caribbean.   I had learned about this place after being on my Yelp app a few weeks ago. I am also happy I remembered where the restaurant was. 
I am a 100% vegetarian and I am always looking tasty and unique ways to eat my veggies! I ordered the chana and potatoes which is a a stew of curried chick peas and potatoes. I had the rice and beans on the side along with sauteed cabbage and plantains. i took it to go and went back to my classroom to eat my lunch. I have to say that I am a lover of caribbean food as well as a lover of Indian food as well. Number one, the portion of food she gave me was HUGE!! Number two, the food was FANTASTIC!! The chick peas and potatoes were tender and mildly spiced.  The sauteed cabbage was fantastic, a little salty and very tender. The plantains were tender and cooked perfectly. The portion of rice and beans was huge and they tasted very good. The rice was tender and not over cooked and the beans were just done enough. I have to admit I finished 95% of it because it was so good and I did not want to stop eating it. 
If you want great caribbean food in a clean and not fancy atmosphere, this is the place to try! I know that I will be back and I would love to take my wife there for dinner some time. It honestly was really good! Check out this hidden jewel and you will not be disappointed.",5

800,"Very helpful. Stayed late and was able to fix my laptop without pushing me to upgrade. Saved me a few hundred dollars, very much appreciate that.",5
802,"Let me start out by saying I still have not eaten here... 

The pictures however are making me rethink my stance.  A couple years ago I was so excited to go to this restaurant and even got something in the mail with pictures that I brought along with me.  It clearly stated the hours breakfast was served and as far as the ad was concerned we were on time.  However, when we sat down and I tried to order the picture, I was told they don't prepare eggs that way past a certain time of day.  That I could receive eggs prepared the way they said or not at all.  Due to my prior excitement over the picture, and as a customer being told there were eggs in the kitchen, but they would not use them the way they advertised, I was very deflated.  It ruined my appetite, we stood up without ordering or eating and have never been back since.  

I am glad to see so many positive reviews, hopefully I will move past my grudge soon and finally try the food that aesthetically appealed to me before.",1
803,"Visited for the first time on Wednesday, Oct. 10.  Three barbers on hand so the wait was very short.  The cut and care received were first rate and I have difficult hair to cut - stiff, thick Asian hair.  The barber did a masterful job.  The result was greeted by high praise from the severest critic - my spouse.",5
804,I love this place since the first opointment . The owner is amazing . She knows exactly what your hair needs. I strongly recommend this place!!!,5
809,"I was a customer for years. The manager was always accomodating. I can respect the patience it must take to deal with a daily influx of customers, and rarely criticize any worker!  Today, I drove over to print a few things and mail out a gift. I was terrified to see a man out front with two of the most terrifying dogs I've ever seen...unleashed (one looked like it had a limp, but was still intimidating! I returned to my car to wait for him to leave the area when it appeared he walked into Postnet. But I wondered if maybe he and the dogs had gone next door. 

  Not wanting to sit in my car all day, I called a girl answered. I asked if there were dogs in the store. She said, ""Yea."" So, I responded , ""Is that allowed?"" In a  nasty tone she told me, ""He's allowed to have his dogs in the store."" And HUNG up.

   I wish the owner should reconsider allowing animals into such a place (especially the ones I saw). It's a lawsuit waiting to happen. Mainly though, it was the rudeness I encountered. With all of the nice  people who'd appreciate a job why hire such a person who is nasty to the customers? Naturally, I don't want to return. Who would pay money to be mistreated or heaven forbid mauled?",1
812,"The grooming department service was terrible. The staff are not friendly at all and weren't helpful. When we walked in for our appointment, we got a ""what do you want"" style of greeting. They didn't want to answer questions or even acknowledge us. These aren't the types of folks Id would want to leave my dog alone with for a few hours.",1
813,"If I could give this a no star I would! First off the dishes were such small portions, second the dishes had maybe a couple of pieces of meat in it so when you order a bunch of food, you'll probably get a single portion of meat in it! And last the service was just beyond rude. The waitress wasn't helpful in the food selection and she didn't even bother asking us if we needed the bill. She came by to ask if we were done and then walked away! Took us about ten minutes to get her attention so we can pay and leave. There's so many other places to go to for Thai food so don't even bother with this one. This isn't my first time here, when I went couple of years ago, it was such a great place but now quality of food and service has definitely gone down.",1
814,I don't know why I keep giving this place a chance.  They are nice but they do not care about the work they do.  The men do not know what they are doing.  They try to finish quickly So they are constantly hurting you. They paint over your cuticles so feel behind lifting and catching on everything.  Very cheap so I guess you get what you pay for.,1
815,"Ismael from EPP was terrific!  I was HORRIFIED reading these reviews - simply horrified. Our septic ejector pump sprung a leak at 6 a.m. and we contact our home warranty company (Fidelity National). They took forever to get us a name of a plumber to come out same day. Yup - I called and spoke to Mike and he gave us a window from 1 - 6 p.m., which is totally unacceptable. Just before 1 p.m., a Ismael called from EPP - what a pleasant guy!  He arrived well within 30 min. and by 1:50 p.m. our pump was fixed. He knew what he was doing and was so polite! (So glad it wasn't Mike! I had another plumber on call solely based on these reviews.) Ismael rocks!",5
817,"Came here and ordered the breakfast bagel sandwich, it was amazing. The egg, cheese, bacon, pesto, with the red peppers are delish. This might be my fav breakfast sandwich ever.

821,"This is going to be a plain and simple review. I didn't have a stylist, I was bouncing place to place, always taking chance of not getting exactly the haircut I wanted. And I found out many times that the place I went to, was the wrong place.
     Then, about 3 or 4 months ago I meant Yvonne. I told her what I was looking to do and she just took over right then and there and she gave me the best haircut I've ever had.!! She's really really cool, down-to-earth, modern, really really experienced, and did I mention that she's the best stylist i'i've had?
     Make sure you book your appointment a week before you need to go because her books always full....................Your Welcome in Advance!!!!!!!",5

826,"I saw a used car online for $14,5 K, so I decided to go check it sine it's in my budget and everything looked good. Then I had to face the worst sales ever, they start talking about the price, it was $15 K with their ""rebate"", so I asked why the price is showing different numbers and their answer was ""car is new only has 4000 miles on it"" which drive me mad because a car that have scratched paint, spots on the seats, and 4000 miles is a used car, they're not honest about their online price.
They kept insisting that this a new car and they even tried to charge me for options, I end up yelling at them then leaving, but they followed me and tried to sell me the car for the online price and without added options but by that time I decided that they doesn't deserve my business.",1
828,I'm here on the daily even though it's a little out of my way home from work. Why? Forget making you read a lengthy review (which I can def write for you!)...just go in and give it a try!!! You won't be let down. I recommend the Rose milk tea!,5

830,"I don't even write Yelp reviews, but I'm making an exception because Chris, owner of Town Barber, is that rare dude who is loyal to his customers, and I don't know where else to put this story.

I've been getting my fades done by Chris since he was an apprentice barber at Crow's Nest, charging only $15 a cut. Probably since 2010. I used to get my hair cut once a week, cause I like to stay looking fresh. So Chris has cut my hair literally hundreds of times. Every haircut has been exacting and perfect, he genuinely takes the time to ensure it's so. I'll think I'm done and be trying to get up, and he'll be touching up this side and that part, grabbing his clippers to fix some tiny imperfection no one else would ever have noticed. The guy genuinely cares about his craft, and it shows in his work.

More importantly than that, he's a stand up, humble guy. After ending his apprenticeship at Crow's Nest, and moving to a full barber, charging full barber prices, he kept me at the original price, for YEARS after. He refused to change the price I paid, and even when I offered he wouldn't accept more money. A lot of business owners are ""customer service"" friendly, like on the surface, but Chris actually backs it up. He understands, just naturally as a facet of his personality, that long term customer relationships are more valuable than an extra $10 in his pocket today, which is a rare trait.

In 2012, I left Toronto and moved to California, then moved back two years later. I went to Crow's Nest, and found out Chris wasn't working there anymore and had opened up his own spot. So I went over there for a cut. During my first cut, I mentioned how I was looking for work. Chris referred me to a friend of his who was hiring, and gave me his email. I emailed him, we met up, and I've been working for his company for the past 7 months. So Chris helped me get a job.

THEN as if that wasn't enough, when I told him I got the job, he told me I couldn't pay for my haircuts anymore because I was working for his friend's company. I don't even know if I should publicize this cause y'all will go in expecting to leave with jobs and free haircuts. I've referred everyone I know there. My nephew and brother in law now get their hair cut by Chris too, and that's a strong endorsement because my sister is serious about her son's haircuts.

So if you're not getting your haircut at Town Barber, you should be.",5

It looked like all they did was get my carpet wet with water. NOT A SINGLE SPOT WAS REMOVED throughout the entire house. 

THEY SUCK!",1

I now know why PGA, LPGA players in town all go here for fittings. 

They also carry higher end clubs (PXG, etc) and all the iron sets come blank.. (no grip or cut shaft) so they are custom made for you.

Waited for my friend and they brought Pellegrino when I asked for sparkling H20. We split the Jerusalem artichokes (with caramelized onions and feta) as an appetizer and these were fantastic. I then had the asparagus with egg and my friend had the gulyash -- both super tasty and generous size.

I have arrived here and departed here and both times have been smooth. Plus, I have won at the slot machines here. 

The terminal itself is very clean. The bathrooms are clean and spacious. The restaurants are nice and plenty of ATMs as well. 

Getting to gate D can be a bit of a hassle and struggle because you have to take the red line but I can deal with that. Just a lot of walking to get to the main entrance. I guess that comes with the territory. 

But, in regards to the terminal itself, finding your proper gate is easy and all the service people are over the top nice in making sure you at the right gate and have the right ticket.

Good vibes all around!",5

I find the bag in fitting rule kinda bothersome because you can't bring it in with you( which made me feel kinda uncomfortable) but nether less if you're willing to spend a good amount for trendy clothing I'd recommend aritiza. The cashiers were really understanding of the fact that my card wasn't working properly, leaving me putting away a really cute shirt. The only little problem I have is that the sales associates are a bit hard to find in the store, but once you pick up a piece of clothing it's a race to get to you.",5
878,"It blows my mind that other Yelper's who give such low reviews, of course you're gonna wait, and they seem to never have a problem with my fade when I get my haircut every two weeks. These guys know what they're doing, and it's evident in the constant flow of business I see coming into the barbershop every time I go.

Mike (Mikhail) is the only person I will even allow to cut my hair. Period. From the first day I went there I didn't even need to tell him how I wanted it done, he could tell and did it to perfection and continues to every single time. The man is truly the best at what he does.

From the straight razor neck trims, to the hot towels and an old school shoulder massage, for SIXTEEN dollars is pretty damn insane. 

My brothers, father and even my younger nephew go here and have since it's doors have opened. Check em' out, it's a great vintage barbershop! 

Heads up, they're closed Sundays.",5
879,I like CVS better than Walgreens ! Thy are clean and the employees are always helpful and polite,5
882,"Scents:
They have some pretty good scents you can't get elsewhere. But some are hit and misses. I got a really stale one once that smelled like stale water. They would not replace it. Also be wary of the reviews of each fragrances. They often don't post your negative reviews, and post all of your positive reviews.  This kind of makes it misleading and false. 

Containers:
I usually get the discounted ones. Products are pretty good. BUT someone can't count in their packaging dept. They always give you less than what is specified. I am always missing a cap or something. They would not resend the missing ones to you.

Customer service: 
Really bad. They don't resend missing pieces or bad products. They also aren't knowledgeable about the products they sell. I got quite a few rude ones. 

Butters:
I bought cocoa butter 6/2010. Expiration on it says 6/2011. It actually went rancid by 4/2011. Cocoa butters is very stable and will keep for about five years and resist going rancid. They were probably selling old butters for super high prices.

Prices:
Yup I agree with the other review: They increased their prices too much for fragrances. One good thing though is that their shipping is free.

Overall, purchase at your own expense. They take no responsibility over anything.",1
883,Great place to get a drink here and sit outside if the weather permits.,5
885,Best smoke shop in Scottsdale! Not only do they have the best selection but their customer service rocks as well. Their prices are much lower than their competitors but quality is even better. This is the only smoke shop in the valley that I visit and I'd definitely recommend that everyone make a visit.,5
886,Went on a Thursday afternoon around 4 and was not greeted. Had to walk all the way in to someone that was working and ask for a gel manicure in which no one knew how to do but some lady in the back.  The polish was ovishly old and instead 2 coats I got 3. Never was asked how I wanted my nails shaped.  Will never go back.  There is a charger for credit use and tips are cash only.,1
887,"Bad bad bad. Dr. Allen is good, ive been a patient for 5 years and followed him here, but his office management and staff is awful. Calls are never returned and communication is absent. Not worth the hassles and unprofessional treatment. There are equally good and better offices out there. Goodbye Dr. Allen.",1

889,"First time here- fianc√© ordered the chef seafood special... Hands down best Italian dish I've tasted. Yes, he ordered it... And I ate it because it was that good. Sorry babe! It's a long drive for us but we're willing to put on some mileage to come back here again. Oh, our server was great! The whole atmosphere made it seem like we were in little Italy :)",5
891,"I rented a property from Tradewind for over 4 years and it was not the best experience. I had to send several emails to get the property manager to respond. I had a lot of isssues that I ended up doing my self to avoided having to deal with them. When I moved in I was told I did not have to worrie about the carpets since they were not cleaned and I did not pay for a cleaning fee. I bought my own carpet cleaner to clean the carpets every few months. When I gave my 30 days notice I was sent an email with a list to clean the property I was ok with that. They ended up charging me for random little Things but the professional carpet cleaner unbelievable. Office staff are all rude and tend to make you feel like your bothering them to do their job. The  maintenance lady is a very sweet lady she would get back to me the same day.

* no ac for 1 week one year and the next summer I had no ac again for 2 weeks. 

* I had a broken fridge 2 times lasted over a week.

* day of move in found dog poop in the master bedroom!",1
892,"Frankly, I'm surprised this place has remained in business as long as it has.  I gave it a couple of chances, but always walked away disappointed.  The food isn't really the issue, but it's nothing special either.  The service here is consistently atrocious.  I've had waiters forget about me, I've seen them bring out completely incorrect orders, and I've had cold food brought out after absurdly long waits.  For this type of dining, just head up the road to Chili's and give O'Charley's a pass.",1
894,"Fionn's is a classy-looking restaurant with pretty hanging iron and stained glass lights and decorated with a lot of wood and photos of Ireland. There's quite a lot of seating and definitely good for both groups and intimate small dinners. Monday to Thursday they have daily food deals and they have live bands on the weekends. We went on a Sunday, but saw the advertising for it. 

The bartender, Amber, was very pleasant. She was very attentive and talkative. We didn't sit with an empty cup once throughout our visit. She recommended the Guinness Steak & Mushroom Pie and it was so delicious. It's an in-house made pie that is golden brown and is so flaky, stuffed with saucy button mushrooms and beautiful fall-apart, large chunks of beef. The pie is on top of a generous pile of mashed potatoes and gravy. Best pie I've ever had. My boyfriend ate a good portion of my plate and loved it, and he hates mushrooms. He ordered the Blarney Fries, which is crispy lattice fries smothered in a tasty ""kick'd up ale"" cheese sauce, diced tomatoes, green onions and jalape√±os. It was awesome and is apparently the house staple here. 

We will be coming back here for sure. Great food, great service, great experience. I'm considering bringing my family here for my birthday.",5
897,"I have been coming here off and on and switched once to the other guys, but I find that the Lube and Oil Department's service writer, Kim, to be fair and honest and makes each of my visits feel like I am getting a good value. Her quick attention to everyone's car under hood is expertly delivered. I never like the car wash as it is indeed sloppy, at best. But, Cobblestone Auto is my first choice for engine oil maintenance. The included car wash, discounted, is always lack luster and is why when I just want a wash I choose another company. Perhaps, it is time to have a review of how to effectively wipe and dry off automobiles. Seems like all the Yelps ding the car wash. Maybe instead of a ""driver"" decal on the employees uniform, a more appropriate decal might read everyone's retrained and you will not believe our attention to the details. Rag dust okay but floor mats transposed and still lint on the dash and door jams wiped but never expertly cleaned or wiped down. Maybe also have the service writer Kim teach the car wiper team about customers and caring?",5
898,"Great place nice food and wonderful tequila selection, ask for Erin at the bar for the best service.",5
901,"Rich and creamy goodness!

We had visited their previous location with a great visit there under our belts. They decorated with the same fun antique decor around the dining area.  It was as if they didn't even move to another location.  There are also a few tables out on the patio area.

It was pretty busy as the weather was warmer and everyone else had frozen custard on their minds.  There was quite a line but they had it under control!  The line moved very very quickly.  The lady taking our order was cheerful and very helpful.

Even though it was a busy night, we received our order quite fast.  Our orders were correct as we all devoured the delicious dessert.  Nielsen's delivers, yet again, a satisfying tasty treat. We love it!",5
902,"Mughal Grill is by far the best restaurant for Indian and Mughal cuisine I had in this country. I ordered the lamb kababs and suji halwa. It will be unfair on my taste buds if I don't say they were the best I ever had in USA. I was offered a kheer on the house after the meal. It was a colorful gastronomic journey. The kheer was so perfect in taste with just the right sweetness and viscosity. I left the restaurant a happy man with rush of serotonin and endorphins in my brain. 
I give this place a 5 out of 5 rating.",5
903,I have been in line at the pool bar for over 40 minutes waiting to order a drink. I could've put my beverage from one of the casinos bar into a plastic cup and had a lovely time at the concert.,1

Again the coffee is ok but the service is sub par.",1
910,"Excellent service was the icing on a very delicious cake. Our server, Devin was a delight. Very thoughtful, very attentive and very knowledgable. I would go back for the service alone.

The food: It was delicious with only one (tiny) issue. We had the tomato bread (because you have to) with the Ham Platter (Seleccion de embutidos) which included Iberico ham, Serrano and a spicy salami - which was amazeballs. Totally brought back memories of Barcelona tapas bars.

I also can't say enough about the 'Pimientos Rellenos de buey' (Piquillo peppers stuffed with braised oxtail and Manchego cheese) - rich, decadent, delicious and perfectly paired with the wine we were drinking. The wine was from the Ribera Del Duero region, called 'Avaniel' - highly recommended.

We also had their Fideo pasta special - with  shrimp, summer vegetables, soffrito 'sauce' and aioli. It was delicious - except that the shrimp were a tad overcooked (sorry Chef!). They could have stood to be cooked about a minute or two less than they were (or maybe it was a heat lamp issue).

It's easy to pick on a tiny flaw because the overall experience was just so great. I would definitely go back, and often.",5

We were so impressed with the food, and my husband actually uttered the words, ""I don't want this to end."" We started with sangria and fondue which were both fantastic. My entree was the smart chicken and hubs had the pork tenderloin. Both  were unbelievably good and our server was wonderful. It's rare to have all the components of a nice meal come together so perfectly, and this is definitely worth the money!",5
917,"So glad I dropped in here. Maggie is the BEST! Sweet, strong and attentive; she's like a bloodhound when it comes to finding all my knots. I love strong pressure and she never skimps on that.  
Facility is clean with semi-private sections. Relaxing instrumental music. Sometimes you'll hear a bit of noise from the restaurant next door or the snores of a client who's fallen asleep during their massage. It never bothers me, but bring foam earplugs if you're the sensitive type.  
You get massaged with your clothes that you wear in, so wear a tank top and shorts or something similar.",5
918,"Call it Crappy Taco. That pretty much sums up the experience you are going to get. 

Unlike others, I actually thought the tacos were pretty good. But on this busy Sunday, everything else was unpleasant. Other than the view, there is absolutely no reason to visit this place, unless you have a fetish for outdoor Jenga and lousy service. And you can find views just as good as this in Cleveland where your experience will actually be pleasurable.

This was our second time visiting here, and both times were unpleasant. On this visit:

1. The outdoor hostess greeted us with contempt. She may as well have said, ""Oh. You."" when she took our name. A smile and a hello seemed a foreign concept to her.

2. Since there was a wait, we sat at the bar. We may as well have been ghosts. The bartender looked past us three times while he waited on other patrons who it seemed were his old pals from high school. Finally, another bartender came and helped. Good, right? Wrong...

3.  I got the house margarita, and I think it may have been the only time in my life that I sent a drink back. It was like drinking salted lime water. I had both my wife and friend taste it to make sure I wasn't crazy, but they concurred: It was nothing short of awful. 

4.  Our server was kind, but she seemed to really be struggling. I am not sure if this was her fault or the inept and unfriendly bar, but it took us over 20 minutes to get our drinks. In fact, our appetizers came out before our drinks! And when the apps did arrive, we were missing our guacamole. In fact, our main entrees arrived before our guacamole...which arrived before we had more chips with which to eat them. And so on...

Nothing is all bad. The tacos were actually pretty tasty. Paying our bill was quick. But I found the whole experience condescending. What I mean by that is that Coastal Taco seems to exist on the premise that, because of their prime riverfront location, the employees don't have to do anything other than show up and act surly, as if we should be thrilled that we graced them with our presence. No, that is not the way it is supposed to work.

Given the embarrassment of riches when it comes to Cleveland's dining scene, we deserve and should expect better.",1

All of the meats were very tender and tasted very good

921,"I have a 2003 Mustang GT with some issues but none that were a show stopper until yesterday. :^0

The diagnostics were kinda pricy BUT the cost is applied towards your repair if you decide to go forward with any repairs.

I dropped off my vehicle late Friday about 4:30 and was promised a visual inspection and call back if diagnostics were needed: that did not happen, which concerned me. :^\

When I came in Saturday morning, my car was in the bay being looked at. I had only signed and authorized for a visual inspection but they had done some electrical diagnostics which I don't think they would have charged me for. :^)

I don't know everything about car repair but I can tell most of the time if I am being B.S.ed. 

They recommended about four repairs to fix one problem.

One repair they recommended I know was needed but I feel weren't necessary. In other words, I have been driving with this condition for some time (three years) and was told by another shop that the repair could be put off for a while but the condition should be repaired soon (that was just two months ago). 

Don't get me wrong: it is not like Meineke was doing wrong or even acting in bad faith: it was one shops opinion versus another's (along with my my previous research into the issue) that made me feel that the one repair could be put off for a while.   

It's hard to believe that the issue had contributed to my cars driveability  but I needed to get it done sooner or later so I opted to get it done that day because the cost was VERY FAIR AND REASONABLE AND I BELIEVED THE SHOP WAS ACTING IN GOOD FAITH.

They did recommend a spark plug change (as that could have contributed to my issue) but if they had actually checked the plugs, they would have seen that they were fine and recently changed.

I just got the car back and did not check the invoice yet but I will update this review in a few weeks and give more feed back as the car's OBD calibrates.

1/1/16 Update:

No problems with the repair and satisfied with the service: I have not had any more issues with my car so I have not been back which is VERY GOOD!

I would recommend this place to a friend for sure!",5
924,"Where do I start. Carson's Kitchen has the feel of a kitchen tucked away in a warm eclectic cozy basement. The cocktails are defined by there - ""well, that's rather good!"" compliments as the meals head out of the BOH with a consistent array of well balanced tapas foods.

Google will never replace a confident human being in business who knows what they are selling.

931,"I usually love this place but tonight the service was absolutely horrible!! First off they were out of kalbi and spam Musubi!! The excuse from hostess was it was a busy night. That's seriously not an excuse you should say to a paying customer. Then! It took forever to get my food- over 40min and 3 other parties received food before me. I ordered two meat plate of katsu and beef and then a plate of shrimp and thats it! One other dad and dtr left so upset because it took so long for their food to be served. I asked how much longer for my food the first time and she asked ""what'd your order again"" so I told her. No update. I asked 10 min later and she said ""what'd you order again"" seriously?!? I repeated my order and she said Oh here it is it just came out. It was my Katsu and beef and she said that's it. I said NO I'm still waiting for my shrimp. The cooks in back looked like they had no idea about it. And told me they were just waiting for my katsu to be done. I showed them the plate like It's right here..... .... suddenly they had a plate of shrimp there for who knows how long sitting there and said ""oh are you table 6??"" Like YES I am actually. What the hell is happening there?!? No idea what they're doing or how to respond to customers.


Only pro is that the food is still good. Too bad they don't even have it in stock ...

Just checked and my order is wrong .. it's chicken teriyaki instead of beef and they gave me salad instead of macaroni salad. Awesome.....",1

Thank you again great job!!",5
942,"I'm surprised by some of the bad reviews on here, as I've only had only good experiences at Essence. The service has always been friendly and efficient, and everything I've tried has been delicious. They have daily specials which I usually order that have always turned out to be a good choice. The portions are generous for the price, and they use high quality ingredients. At an average price of $10 for lunch, I think this is a great value compared to a lot of other restaurants in the neighborhood. After dining here several times I finally decided to try a mini caramel macaron. They forgot to bring it out with my meal, so to make up for it they brought me an extra vanilla one complimentary. Totally unnecessary, but a very nice gesture!  The macarons were as good as the ones I've had in Paris. I highly recommend the caramel one, so rich and amazing, I can't wait to try more.",5
944,"This is the type of spin class that makes you work, makes you sweat, but you're having a great time dancing on a bike so you don't even really realize the time is flying by.  

The studio has about 24 bikes and the class sizes vary.  I tend to go in the same time slot and some days the classes are close to full, other days there may only be a handful of us.  There are also a great variety of instructors - some that prefer the faster pace of a class and others that like to focus on strength building (I like these!).  They also have shoes available to rent (new- not like old bowling shoes) for $3 per class.

Rachel, the owner, is very friendly and accommodating.  You can really tell that she has a passion for fitness and cares for her customers.

If I had anything negative to say about this place, is that there aren't a lot of options for class times.  But I'm hoping that as this place becomes more established (they've only been open about six months), that they will be able to offer a broader variety of class times.",5

947,"Every time we come here, we have an awful experience. We love the food, it's good quality and tastes amazing, but the service honestly is awful. Our order is almost always wrong that we now check our food before even leaving the parking lot just to find out that it's yet again made wrong, or missing items and we have to go back in. 

The cold sandwiches say they come with mayo, mustard AND Italian dressing. But both our sandwiches came with none of the above. On my veggie americano I asked for no avocado, no cucumber, and extra sprouts, but for some reason don't have green bell peppers on my sandwich either(which it says it comes with as well). Lacking mayo mustard, Italian dressing and bell peppers.

Very disappointed every time which is why we only come here once every 6 months. Please fix this as we love your food, but are tired of being let down!",1

After that I ordered a cup of West African peanut stew and an assorted pretzel basket with beer cheese sauce and cranberry mustard. Once my appetite was wet I order the German sausage plate w hot apple sauce a great choice in the middle of winter. I polished off my flight and had yet another great beer called Potters IPA.

They have ALL DAY BREAKFAST, which I think is incredible. I had the Blueberry Yum Yum, which is french toast with a blueberry compote type sauce and orange agave. I was hesitant about that combination, but it was actually so good. My dad had the T.A.T.S., which is basically a healthier version of a BLT. It came with a side, so he got truffle fries.

969,"If Emma is still a manager here, dont expect to be helped much. I had bought shoes as a Christmas gift and they were too narrow for my boyfriend to fit in them. So I brought them back hoping he could have them exchanged for another shoe he liked. Well it turns out size 10 is very popular and there was NO shoe he wanted available in his size in store or online. Hes not extremely picky either so he asked for about 6 different shoes and no luck. We couldnt even get them from other stores! So we asked Emma if we could just get store credit to spend it later when we find something else we like and she said no. We were 10 days past the return/exchange policy and apparently we were lucky she even considered letting us exchange them in the first place! I let her know that we would literally be throwing our money away if we exchanged the shoes for a pair he didnt even want and she said shes sorry but we need to think of this from the COMPANY'S point of view: ""We cant just let anyone come in 4 months later off the street to return shoes because we dont know what happened to them."" 
I was like, wait, what??? First of all, we're not from the street. We're customers who have a legit receipt and the COMPANY doesnt have any shoes he wants in his size. The shoes Im returning are WHITE all around so you can see theyre in perfect condition. 
She kept repeating the same thing and i was so fed up I called the corporate office. They apologized for her because obviously policies are just guidelines and even though she had the power to give us store credit, she didnt, and thus will require more training on what the COMPANY actually requires of her. 

We're so done with this store. We went to the Foot Locker at AZ Mills and told them what happened and the manager there gave us store credit and said this isnt the first time its happened. Emma has pissed off a lot of people so I hope she gets it together and learns how to appreciate money-spending customers.",1

I've dined in and gotten it to go.  The staff is friendly and if there is a line it moves fairly quickly.

Prices are really cheap.  If you go at lunchtime you can get a combo with a ""freshman"" sub, side (chips, macaroni salad or pickle spears) and a soda for $5.50!!! OMG, that's super cheap to me.  And the freshman is really quite large and stuffed with meat.  I don't think I could have eaten any larger of a size.

I tried the steak and cheese (no cheese, no onions -- the onions are raw, not cooked, so: No. Thank. You. to them.)  The sub was great.  Hot, fresh, tasty -- and that was just the guy behind the counter! (rim shot!) No seriously it was very good and just what I was in the mood for.  Of course if I had been normal and gotten the cheese it would have been even better and stayed together.  But I don't like cheese all the time and it don't like me! (lactose intolerant)

The macaroni salad did waylay me with an unexpected bite of fresh, raw onion -- bleh!  Almost ruined my taste buds for my sub.  Personally I would steer clear of it in the future, even though it was very fresh and otherwise tasty.

Other than that, great cheap meal on a cold night.  The dining room is pleasant and a lot more clean and comfortable than a lot of sub joints I have seen around.

Looking forward to trying the egg salad, which is made daily.  Hopefully without onions!",5
981,Thank you Oliver for all your help!!! I had a great experience was on time and attentive. Made the experience easy and will definitely refer!!! Thanks again!!!,5
982,"Don't let the ghetto shopping center steer you away...it's a great place.  Definitely a no frills type place...this is the real deal.  It was very evident by most of the patrons actually being Vietnamese, you know it must be good.

You just walk in and sit anywhere that's open and someone will bring you their menu which is quite extensive.  I had my favorite, which is Pho Tai.  The broth was perfect, and had a pretty complex flavor profile.  Hard to explain, but some pho broth's are very 1-dimensional...this one was exceptionally flavorful.  They don't skimp on the meat either, which some places tend to do.  I've been to Vietnamese restaurants all over the valley, and although I have still never been to Da Vang...I'd venture to say this might be the best pho in Phoenix.  Tastes darn close to the stuff you get in CA, in Garden Grove/Westminster/Little Saigon.

Also, it is dirt cheap! $4.50 for a big delicious bowl of pho tai....yum.  I'll be back soon for sure.",5
984,"Read this before you go:
Hint #1:This is meant to be a family-style restaurant, meaning that you get little plates and everyone takes some of each entree on their little plate.
Hint #2: This is a Korean restaurant, meaning the food is Korean spicy. If you don't like spicy, do not get the tteokkboki or the spicy chicken. If things are really spicy for you, you can cool off your mouth with rice, pickled radish or iced tea.
Hint #3: If you get the bibimbap, PLEASE, mix it all together and add gochujang sauce to your desired spicy level. You can always add more sauce on your own plate.

We had a great experience - we were seated quickly, we got our food fairly quickly, everything was hot (temp wise) and our drinks were refilled before we asked. We did go after 3 on a Sunday, though. And the food, the food was SO GOOD! 

The only downside was that the food did not come out all at once but if you share it family style, you just start with what comes out first.

I wish BonChon luck because we would like to be regulars.",5
985,"I arrived at Charlotte 15 minutes before my plane was supposed to leave. I had to transfer from terminal B to terminal E. When I asked for them to hold my flight, the gate agent said that they know we're coming and not to worry. We ran to the gate and there was no one there and no plane. When they came back they said that 15 minutes ago they gave our seats to standby passengers and that the PLANE LEFT 15 MINUTES EARLY! They told us that it is a transfer airport so they usually leave early. BS!  They told us that they only hold the plane if there at least 10 people missing. Luckily there was 1 more flight that night. Suck it U.S Airways",1
988,Where to start with this place.. so freakin good! We had the  fried Chicken meal along with the Brussel sprouts and fried green tomato appetizer. We were impressed with everything. The chicken was perfectly cooked as well as the Brussel sprouts. I'm not a watermelon eater but my husband said it was delicious! The atmosphere is cool and it feels like your hanging out at a friends for dinner. Must experience.,5
989,"In a city that has an abundance of Mexican restaurants, this is one of the gems that I have discovered.  Mexican is one of my favorite types of food, so to continue to frequent one place really says something.  The menu is typical of a taco shop, with tacos, burritos, quesadillas, nachos, fries, and others.  I especially enjoy the torta.  They have a great selection of meats for any of their menu items.  Everything is made to order, so during a busy time, it can be a bit slow, but it is well worth the wait!",5
990,"The cafe has delicious sandwiches.  The kid making the food seemed either hangry or tired. However the cashier in the cafe was very sweet, upbeat and super pleasant.  
Ample parking.",5
992,"A family owned restaurant in the heart of Gilbert which gives back to the community through fundraisers and friendly service...  When you get to know the employees they become like family, two of the very best are Mike and Ben! 

The food... Fantastic!  A great menu and really interesting specials.  Primarily this is a sandwich/pizza with in house freshly baked bread and wheat wraps however they take it a step further with bruschetta, mushroom Phylos and other good stuff!",5
993,I can only speak for the food - not the sushi-  the shogun chicken with noodles and the shogun salad are the signature dishes and I LOVE THEM!  Consistently yummy for years. - nothing like it anywhere else.  Don't let the sushi haters scare you away from the regular menu - everything I've had has been great!  Ps never had a problem with service either.,5
994,"I love Your Helping Hands! I enjoyed their services so much, I wrote an article about them and put them on my website as a ""Top Pick"" of Las Vegas. Here it is below--

This is our top pick for house cleaning services in Las Vegas. They are thorough, dependable, and have successfully served the Las Vegas Valley since 1991. Even more, they use only safe and green products.

I've lived here two years and tried six different businesses. I've also heard plenty of horror stories from longtime residents. Don't be fooled by dirt cheap cleaning services; you get what you pay for. Some places rush over things, some places break things, some places take things. Some use strong-smelling, toxic chemicals that leave your place smelling like a grim hospital ward. Other places go through employees like air traffic controllers.  Once I was informed by a cleaning office that two experienced women would be arriving at 2pm sharp. At 2:25pm two guys approximately 18 and 19 roll up in a raggedy gangster car with no hubcaps and cracked rear window. They walk in, pants pulled down showing their boxers, carrying a cheap old vacuum with dangling cord. I say ""Sorry guys, not happening.""

Then one day I notice a shiny, practical, white hatchback parked across the street loaded with a variety of cleaning supplies. The car windows display a house cleaning advertisement/logo. Soon three industrious-looking women come bustling out my neighbor's apartment door, carrying vacuums and mops. I ask them for a flyer which they hand me with a smile.

Next week they clean my 2 bedroom apartment. Before they arrive, Cindy, a co-owner and manager, gives me a courteousy call to check in. The three-women crew does an amazing job. Everything is swept, cleaned, scrubbed, scoured, washed, emptied, dusted, polished, picked up, put away, folded, and now shiny. And get this:  it smells fine, too, light and clear, no crazy chemicals. They use only safe and green products. A few minutes after the girls leave, Cindy calls again, making sure all went well.

I was so impressed I used them again. They did another stellar job.

So I decided Las Vegas Top Picks should have a top pick for housecleaning, too. I asked to meet the owners, Cindy and Bobby. One spring afternoon I visited their office; we sipped peppermint tea and talked house cleaning.

They told me some funny stories of celebrity clients. One individual had a large cougar in his garage, which often sat atop a 100K+ luxury car scratching the bejesus out of it. Since they've been in business for nearly 22 years, they have many such stories! Such a length of time also exemplifies their success and trustworthiness. Bobby, the owner, takes pride in her work and good care of her ""girls"". Their website, which I hope you visit, further demonstrates this. It is comprehensive, professional, personal, and with a big clean heart. They work hard to tailor their cleaning to your precise specifications. In my experience, businesses that truly care about what they do provide the best service.

Also awesome was their giant city map pinned to an office wall. Was I in a secret CIA hub scouting the streets of Las Vegas? Or perhaps they just have tons of customers and know this town like the back of their helping hands.

They even have a mascot - a cute friendly little dog named Bella.  

I believe it's important to find skilled trustworthy businesses whenever spending money, doubly important when they come into your home on an ongoing basis. For house cleaning Your Helping Hands is TOP in this town!

996,"Serive is always great and the food is amazing! 
Been coming to the central location for years. 
I will say with any good restaurant comes good clientele and sometimes there could be a wait... let me tell you it is well worth the wait!!!
They always take care of you while you're waiting, you still have chips, you still have salsa and you still have your drink while your waiting (remember people the wait staff does not control the kitchen...  sometimes things just happen, so be nice to your servers!) 
Love this place and I will  continue to be a loyal customer!
Shout out and a thank you to all the staff!",5
997,"After reading the reviews here, I took my cat in today (who hadn't peed in 2 days). I was fearing the worst about kidney disease. 

WHAT a good experience. I was quite nervous about the cat, and the girl at the front was not only knowledgeable, but kind and honest as well.   I don't feel like I was scalped financially, and I feel good about the outcome for the cat (antibiotics and UT treats should do the trick). 

Highly recommend. And I'm picky.",5
1004,"The pizza stands out from most ordinary pizza places, by far the best pizza I've had in the pittsburgh area. The sause is sweet and the pizza is greasy like a Philly cheese steak hoogie.  Here delicious!!!!",5
1005,"I love this place! Josette is great and does an amazing job on my lashes! I'm so happy I found her. She has a quite Shop and is always able to work with my schedule. She is reasonably priced as well! I love the central location of the store, makes It easy for me to pop by when I'm out and about. I highly recommend vibe!",5
1006,"I have been taking been taking all 3 of our pups to Scottsdale Vet Clinic for over 5 years. Our primary Veterinarian is Dr. Lockhart, he is kind and very good with our dogs. I trust him %100 with his advice and choices to help benefit the health and wellbeing of our dogs. 

Since we absolutely love our vet clinic we also chose to use their grooming services for our dogs. I highly recommend Chris for grooming services. She is great with handling our dogs, even great with our stubborn snotty chihuahua who absolutely loves Chris. Chris even gives her beautifully painted nails. We have never had a bad experience with her and our dogs. I always recommend her to people when they are seeking out a groomer. 

The only negative I can say about the place is the front desk doesn't always have the best customer service. If it wasn't for the amazing vet techs, Dr.'s, and grooming I would probably walk out with a less than amazing experience with the way the front desk handles situations. Their communication is subpar considering the rest of the Clinic is amazing.",5
1013,"Veggie platter was bland, bland, bland. Didn't even bother finishing. Can't help but think it's dumbed down for white Bay Streeters.",1
1014,"A Las Vegas favorite for myself and coworkers!  At least one visit to this place is in order every time we are staying in or passing through Vegas.  If you are looking for fresh food that has an unexpected twist on two great food styles, then look no further.  Meals are made to order, and If you are not absolutely starving you should stick with the half orders.  I think i have had just about everything off the menu now, and I haven't been disappointed.  Great value for fresh prepared food and the flavors are on point.  As long as they are around, I'll always be back!",5
1015,Such a cute caf√©! The cats were very cute and fun to play with. Definitely coming back for another visit soon.,5
1016,"Disappointed. I was referred to this property by a resident so I was really looking forward to seeing the moldes for rent.  However, can we say major disappointment with the employee working. Jennifer was her name.  She has absolutely no customer service skills at all! She was assisting a couple at the time I walked in so I sat down and waited. When she finally decided to greet me she was very rude.  She asked me, well I should say barked at me as to what I needed. I advised I was interested in a two bedroom model. She then said to me it was going to be a 15 to 20 minute wait. Now, this was said with a major attitude. I said that was fine; I didn't mind waiting. She then barked again. And said, "" Are  you sure!?  I mean it's a wait and I am the only employee here!  They left me all alone here!"" This was so unprofessional and rude!  At this point I lost all interest and left. It's very sad that this employee Jennifer is a reflection on the company and other staff members. The resident that referred me has always had great and pleasant experience with the staff and loves residing at this property.  I will go back, but I certainly will not have Jennifer helping nor do I think she belongs in this type of profession.",1
1017,Loved it. Great burger. Excellent French fries. Sitting outside next to the canals for a great view. Service was fast. The spinach salad was very good after they let me swap out the spinach for romaine. Will be back.,5
1019,"We went there, standing at the entrance for about 5 minutes , looking both side for somebody who may lead us a seat. Unfortunately It was nobody who seems to care about new  customers, then we just walked out, that's it.",1
1021,"The woofles and ice cream was sadly disappointing. The woofles was soft, and not in a good way, as in moisture absorbed into it so it was soggy. The ice cream wasn't special either. Nice service (even though they got one of our orders wrong) but will not be having another there. This was in July, so not sure if its changed since.",1
1022,My favorite sushi place in the city! Great staff and awesome prices. They recently expanded the restaurant for more seating. For the amount of food and quality you can't beat the price.,5
1024,Visited this place last weekend.  Tried a couple of signature cocktails with the fun ice and had a couple of entrees and sides.  Sat at bar.  All very good and great bartender.   Didn't try a burger but will go back and try another time - they looked amazing!,5
1029,"The only reason I am giving this location a single star is because of a decision  made at corporate, so I was told, so I guess this rating goes out to all their locations.
I went in for a pumpkin donut, why? Because it's not even two weeks until Thanksgiving, and who doesn't want a couple pumpkin flavored donuts this time of year? Corporate Dunkin Dounts, that's who, or at least that's what I was told. Was told I'd have to go somewhere else to get pumpkin flavored donuts, not in that many words, but what they told me was that corporate allowed them to purchase just so many of them until they were not available any more for the year.
If this is true ( and if it's not, someone still screwed up to not have pumpkin flavored donuts this time of year) then I think it's a bone headed decision. I mean talk about being out of touch with your customers. Talk about turning away business and sending your custom base to another donut store. Talk about plain stupidity. I mean what time of the year do you have a craving for pumpkin flavored donuts than now, around Thanksgiving? 
America runs on Dunkin? Well Dunkin, you sent this America running towards the competition.",1
1034,"My husband and I have been eating at Los Olivos for the last 15 years.  This restaurant is authentic Mexican cuisine.  The place is run by family.  
Sometimes you do have to wait awhile for the food.  The wait staff is usually pretty good.  
The food is always fresh and served hot.  Today I ordered the Chimichanga plate.  The shredded beef is always delicious.  There homemade salsa is so delicious.  

I'm not sure exactly what restaurant a previous reviewer ate at stating they ate garbage.  Maybe they were at Taco Bell.  

You won't be disappointed with Los Olivio's but be patient.  Authentic food that's fresh takes time so enjoy visiting with friends and family while you wait.",5
1036,"By far the freshest, super cool, Mexican offerings in the valley. A great combination of authentic food with a modern vibe and obvious pride in what they do. I've never brought a guest who was not impressed.",5
1037,"My first impression of the House Brasserie was a disappointment. My boyfriend had made reservations several weeks in advance as a surprise Valentine's day gift to me. The reservations were confirmed  for 8:45 via Opentable. Then a voicemail was received confirming the same time but we would need to be out of the restaurant by 10:30 as the table was needed for another reservation. At 5:50, a text was received confirming 5:45 reservation time. My boyfriend called the restaurant ask about the mixup only to be told in a condescending voice that they would TRY to accommodate the 8:45 time slot. My upset boyfriend was left with the impression that the restaurant was trying to coerce him into canceling his reservation so someone else could take our place instead. This is just poor form for a restaurant that is supposed to be such a fabulous place.",1
1039,"Every time anyone asks about sushi or wants to know where to get good sushi, I always refer them to Sushimon. 

Now, don't get me wrong, this place is not perfect. However having tried more than a few spots in town, and seen the many gimmicks put up by other places, Sushimon remains my favorite sushi spot. 

All the negatives that people mention about this place are technically  true

- This place is not close to the strip.
- The wait time can be long(sometimes topping out at 1 hour +
- The restaurant is smallish.

However, if you're visiting Vegas, and really want good sushi, is it  that horrible to drive an extra 10 minutes to not have to deal with casino parking, not have to walk a mile and a half to get to the place, and not deal with the absurd prices you often find at restaurants on the strip?

I've often found, that any restaurant, be it big or small that can produce a full house and wait, is doing something right.

Sushimon doesn't offer you fine dining service. It's not going to blow you away with it's superior service.

I don't know about you guys, but I really don't think that matters.

If you're getting AYCE Sushi, you already have an idea of what kind of sushi you want, and what your preference is.

All the server's I've seen at Sushimon are good at getting the food out, and keeping the drinks full.

You could go to some dirty place in the middle of a bad neighborhood and get Sushi for $4-5 cheaper, sure.

But Sushimon offers almost their entire menu on their AYCE and All-you-can-eat Dessert as well. 

I know a lot of places mark off menu items and only offer you one dessert.

Things I LOVE from Sushimon

Nigiri:
- Hamachi (Yellowtail)
- Salmon
- Super White Tuna
- Unagi

Other offerings:
- Hamachi Collar(most places don't offer this, and they sometimes run out, but if they have, order it!)
- Salmon Collar
-All the rolls(and 1/2 rolls for almost all of them if you want to try the roll without getting too full, again something most places don't offer)
-Uni(Sea Urchin) (one per person)
-Ama Ebi(sweet Shrimp) (also one per person)

Dessert(AYCE)
-Mochi Ice Cream (Strawberry/Vanilla)
-Green Tea, Red Bean, and Lychee Ice Cream
- Tempura Ice cream

Sure you could in theory find a cheaper place than this, in a more ""glamorous"" location, but if I'm gonna shell out $20+ for a meal, I don't mind paying a little bit more knowing that my meal is going to be good. Sushimon offers you a large menu to choose from, speedy service, and most importantly, consistency. I've been here at least a dozen times, and haven't once had a bad experience. 

In case anyone is wondering, they DON'T do call ahead seating, so you have to arrive in person to get your party on the list.",5
1043,One hour 40 min for delivery. Called and they lied said it was out for delivery. It was not. Tracker said 22-32min for delivery. Pizza was stone cold.,1
1045,"I went here once and was not at all pleased. The service was slow, my order got messed up and the waitress was more concerned with gossiping with other staff members than taking our drink order. The burgers were dry and were not cooked to the temperature we ordered. It also took forever for the waitress to bring us back our change after we paid. I actually had to ask her to bring us our change and she had the nerve to say that she didn't think we needed any. I'm sorry, but I gave her a $100 bill and the total bill was $47. That really shocked me",1
1046,"I had to wait for my luggage which was comming on the next flight. I decided to get a pizza. Not a good chice though. I havnt been to sauce before not sure if just the airport kocation is bad like this or all of them.
1) the lady back there preparig pizza didnt have gloves on. Grabbing cheese and toping bare hand and spread them on the dough.
2) pizza was extremely salty. Maybe thats how they sell drink!!!!
3) they are stingy with the cheese and topping
For 11$ pizza i expect to have good amount of topping
4) overall pizza didn't look or taste good. I eat it because didnt want to go to another resturant and pay another 11$. Anywhere else i wouldnt even eat it.
Id compare their pizza with 7/11 pizza.",1

It's no wonder I always feel exceptionally better at the end of a session.  I want to take her home with me :)",5

1049,"Seriously amazing! Authentic dishes, fresh ingredients, affordable and delicious! I'm usually very skeptical about places bc of my culinary background but this place was incredible. Other Yelpers were right the place isn't much to look at but just wait until the food arrives. You'll feel like you're in your grandmother's house in the heart of Italy!",5
1050,"Found this place after shopping at Walmart. Decided to go in for a quick lunch with my daughter and surprisingly it was packed. The young hostess was very nice and informed us it was going to be about 20 minutes or less to get seated. The wait ended up being 10 minutes. When I sat down I was greeted immediately by the server, who happened to be the hostess as well! Talk about multi-tasking! Anyways, ordered drinks and placed my order after she came back with our drinks. I ordered the Black Garlic Ramen for me and for my daughter, the chicken karaage. Food came out quick. The Black Garlic Ramen was amazing! The garlic chips and garlic oil they put in, really gives it that awesome kick ass flavor. My daughter also enjoyed her chicken karaage. The karaage was perfect for her. A bit on the small size, but for a kid it was perfect. Not only was the food great and met me and my daughter's expectations, service was also great! Kudos to the girl that was hosting, serving, and bussing, she was kicking ass! I will definitely be back to try the rest of their ramen!",5
1052,"Ate here with my family and it was disgusting. Food is gross, atmosphere is terrible, and the place was dirty. I felt inspired to write this comment after learning they got a C from the health department, but bargained there way with another visit to have the score changed. Yuck!",1
1056,"I tried Echo & Rig 3 times. I will never go back. Lunch food is so so and dinner is better at other Summerlin restaurants. Steaks are sometimes 4 star but skip the dry crab cakes. Since they don't take reservations be prepared to be insulted as I heard one of the owners, Michael, tell a couple you can leave if you don't want to wait 45 minutes. The previous time there I overheard him chastise a lady with her friends she could leave after she paid her bill because someone told him, she was unhappy with the service. She got her salad during her companions dinner and received her appetizer after the salad. What has happened to keeping your customers happy? Be sure to keep away from the host, Pavlav. He is too busy to help you since he is too busy chasing the girls in tight dresses. Not professional front of the house people. Food is nothing special. Sam has a lot of kinks to work out.",1
1058,"I've travelled through out Indonesia......this is better than the food you will find once you've travelled there! Primarily it is the fresh ingredients from the farmers market that make it amazing. I know I shouldn't compare this to thai food, but this is better than any thai food i've had in Calgary hands down. Support this great little shop and you will be rewarded with authentic flavors of the east.",5
1059,"It's a ""piano bar"" that charges a cover to let you in to hear a guy (or sometimes two) playing all the crap Top 40 hits on the piano.  And sometimes you will get lucky and the girl drink drunk bachelorette or birthday party girls will get up and strangle a cat or two up on stage.

Cleveland may not have hundreds of hip places to go to, but you can certainly do better than this one.",1
1061,This place is awesome. Everything is really fresh and the burgers are delicious. Really creative recipes but also some simple ones for the traditional Burger lover. The sweet potato fries are to die for and the fried macaroni and cheese is great. I've also eaten at an event were these guys catered the food and they did an awesome job. Just overall a great place,5
1062,Outstanding Mexican food and very inexpensive prices.  Second time eating there and it was as good as the first.  Mixed fajita platter and chile verde platter. Terrific flavors.  Great salas. Delicious beans and rice.  I'm guessing some lard went into making those beans taste so yummy. Really good food.  Really good.,5

1068,"I absolutely love Coco donuts! They are always fresh and don't leave that weird oil after taste like some donut places do.  They don't have any of those fancy cereal covered donuts, the donuts here  aren't covered in Peeps for Easter nor do they have an extra pound of candy on them as decor,  they are just donuts, good old fashion donuts.  Donuts like the way they were meant to be!  

The store front is small and there is not much room to eat there, it's definitely more of a pick up and take home to enjoy kind of place. 

The customer service is average, not great but not bad. I've come so many different times and days and I've never once had any issues like some other people have, maybe they just didn't like the attitude of certain customers and they are selective to who the sell to? Who knows! But the average customer service is easier to deal with than average tasting donuts from other places. This place will continue to be my go to!",5

After the fourth person asked if I had an appointment this morning and told me to wait and someone else would help, I asked if I should have scheduled an appointment and was told yes, we like to know you're company

I stopped by their parts department to pickup diff fluid and they want $30/qt for what costs $12 online and $20 at AutoNation. I left after 20 mins and went to Autonation where I was warmly greeted and they took my car right away.

1070,"Saw Doctor Araghi. This man is a monster. He would make a great police officer, but he has the social skills and bed-side manner of Hitler.

Forget all the issues you have to contend with at the Core Institute, from getting a timely appointment to, after waiting weeks, waiting some more as they fail miracuously at making you wait up to 90 minutes AFTER your scheduled appointment time.

Then, if you need surgery, I hope you like to wait some more as your condition worsens to the point that surgery no longer is effective.

The Core Institute does not respect the value of their clienteles time. They book as many as possible to make as much money as possible, all at your expense of money and time. Then, when you get your turn, they rush you through, both interviews and surgeries. They never seem to have the time to do things right and they don't seem to care how much pain they cause their patients.

1076,"Summerlicious diners beware....
I went with a rather large group of people here for lunch to try their summerlicious menu. We were very excited to go because their menu looked simple but good. We walked in and immediately loved the decor and the vibe of the place. We were eventually given water and placed our drink orders. 
Most people at our table had the calamari as an appetizer and I have to admit, it was pretty good. Another one of my friends had the salad which she said was yummy and the presentation of it was lovely. The only iffy thing that happened during this course was that someone requested some lemon to use with their calamari and the waitress brought it to her in a dirty glass. 
The main course was where everything started to really go downhill. 
Part 1: The Burger
The majority of us ordered the burger. One person specifically asked if the burger came with any type of sauce on it and he was told by the waiter that no, it didn't. So he continued to order his burger with just cheese, lettuce and tomato on it. When he finally got his burger it had everything on it including some type of mayonnaise/sauce. He then asked our waiter to switch it as he was told that the burger was not supposed to come with sauce. The waiter took it back and then brought back another with pickles and onions on it, no cheese and no sauce. We asked the waiter to take it back again as the only thing that he wanted was a burger with lettuce, cheese, and tomatoes. The burger came back again, but this time we noticed that even though there was no sauce on the bun, the kitchen had replaced one of the old burger patties with sauce and stuck it on the burger. Confused yet? We called for the manager at this point and explained what happened and after 4 tries, the kitchen or our waiter, got it right. I've never seen anyone have to work so hard for a simple burger.
Part 2: The salmon. 
Another person in our group ordered the salmon. It was raw. We also had to call the manager for this one and she was given another ""well done.""
Dessert was interesting. People said that the tiramisu was actually good. I'd believe it, it looked good. Half of us ordered the very questionable creme brulee. I say questionable only because it was a very very cold custard with what looked like an attempt to fire the top but then fell flat because after they fired the top, they put it back in the fridge so it in essence became custard with a soggy really sweet top. It wasn't horrible but it certainly wasn't creme brulee.
After all that, you'd think that the restaurant would have at least comped the cheque for the guy who had to try 4 times to get a very simple burger, and comp the girl who's salmon was raw. But no, that was a fight as well. In the end, one of them paid their bill and the other fought a long and hard battle and finally got his meal comped. 
What started out as a great place turned out horrible. I definitely don't recommend eating there.",1
1080,"I love this place.  D'angelo's is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the area.  The atmosphere is quiet, and good for a date or a nice dinner with family.  The salads are awesome, don't mind the other reviewers.  My only let down on my last visit was that they don't carry gnocchi as a regular menu item anymore.  I used to get that with the breaded chicken strips on top.  It was fantastic.  
I highly recommend D'angelo's!",5
1082,"I've been to B&B twice (once in Jan 2010 and once this past weekend), both times the food has been delicious.  In the Bay Area, it's hard to find really good pasta, so this was a very special treat.

I tried to make reservations on OpenTable for a party of 7, but the max you can do is 6.  So, I called the hostess and requested a table for 7 people at 9pm on Sat.  When we arrived, we were escorted into a private back room (where they store the wine).  The ambiance of the room was fantastic!

At the table, we had the following dishes that I found particularly memorable and delicious:
Gilled Octopus - Best octopus I've ever had
Bucatini 'all'Amatriciana' - This was so good that I got it again at Enoteca San Marco (Batali's other restaurant in the Venetian) 2 days later.  The pasta noodles are nicely al dente.
Jose's Pyramids - We got this as an appetizer.  Delicious!
Steak ""Tagliata"" - The gem butter lettuce accompaniment was really good.  The steak comes sliced (so it's best to order it a bit rarer than you normally would) and is encrusted with delicious peppery-salty goodness.
Harry's Berries Strawberries

My friends also enjoyed:
Warm Lamb's Tongue
Goat Cheese Tortelloni
Warm Peach Crostata

For wine, we had some of the ones from the Batali/Bastianich winery: a bottle of the ""Aragone"" La Mozza 2006 and I had an additional glass of the Morellino di Scansano.  Both were excellent.

When I was here in January, they had a great ""mint love letters"" dish (pesto-stuffed envelope pasta in lamb sauce) that unfortunately wasn't on the menu any more.",5
1084,"Came by again with a friend just to hang out. It really does seem like they fixed the problem with waiters that they used to have.

The service was great, they were friendly and very helpful whenever I had a question. The food never disappoints, I love the cheesecakes and ice cream :)

Will be coming back again!",5
1085,I can't say enough good things about Jennifer! My husband and I just closed on our house and Jennifer made the mortgage process so smooth and simple. If your looking for a mortgage broker call Jennifer you won't be disappointed!,5
1087,"My prior experience at this LensCrafters Store had been horrible, but my experience on 01/6/2016 was a breath of fresh air. My daughter was headed back to school and we were under a time crunch to get new glasses. Sean and all of the staff were very helpful in making sure she was able to get the glasses in a very expedited manner. Thanks so much",5
1088,"I could not believe what I paid for this nasty food. 
1. The lady charged me for side meat I added to my shrimp won ton before asking me if it was ok. No. It was not okay. It was $8 for .22 lbs. plus 9$ for my won ton. Wft. I have never paid this much for won ton of any taste level, not in San Francisco not in Portland Oregon not in San Diego. Overpriced and tastes bad. 
2. Yes. The taste, it was too salty.  From the soup to the tripe to the beef tendon, all salty. I didn't finish the side dishes bc it couldn't stand how salty it was. 
3.  Size does matter when you're paying over 16$ for a won ton dish. The bowl was 6 inches in diameter and about 4 inches deep. Very small. The pic shows the size. 
4. The service was mediocre and the place was so ordinary. Why did I pay so much? I don't understand why this place has 4 stars. Seriously.  I mean 16$ for .5 lbs of tripe. Not one lb. half a lb only. That's 32$ for one lb. yikes. Misleading and very disappointed with this business.",1
1089,My dog was having severe pain when trying to have a bowel movement he would literally scream in pain!! I called this vet because I had a friend recommend this place. I made an appointment and brought him in the following day and upon arrival I could tell my scheduled time was double booked. The gentleman who helped me seemed in a hurry and took my dog right back came out a few seconds later saying my dog was fine and whatever it was must of cleared up. He handed me my leash and said no charge!! I found that to be unsettling but assumed he thoroughly checked my dog quickly and I took his professional word for it. He was wrong! The following day this being a Saturday now my dog did the same thing screaming in pain now trying to have a bowel movement unsuccessfully. At that time the vet was closed so the poor guy went on like this all night Saturday and all day Sunday! He even started to pee blood!! I finally get him back to the vet I figured everyone has a busy day I'll give them another shot. They found out my dog had a bad prostate infection and needed to be neutered. We did that and it went well and I got some going home instructions that said to bring him in in two weeks and that visit was covered under the original charge. Two weeks pass I take him for his follow up. He had diarrhea following the surgery so I mentioned that and in mentioning that without a examination of any kind they brought some pills in and charged me $120 for just mentioning my dog had diarrhea. I looked up the price of the pills on 1800 pet meds it was about $45 in pills so it cost me $75 to mention my dog had diarrhea no examination no nothing. Very disappointed looking for a new vet,1
1090,"LOVE. The best! I love bossam!! I got my first experience in Ktown in LA. I really wished I found places that good but here comes garionban to save me!

We got the large bossam to share between 4 people. I came twice within a month and got bossam both times but the most recent time I got a bone broth with some noodles. To be honest, I forget what it's called but I asked our server. 

Wrap up them pork bellies with the lettuce or that leaf they have. Add some of that kimchi, raw garlic, red paste, jalepeno, and bite! Yummmm. Amazing!! Just typing this review is making me hungry.

Just go and order it!! I brought my friends that live in SF while they're here for a week and they've come back twice already! Just do iiiitttt.",5
1092,"Wonderful, amazing experience to dine and hang at Studio AM. My husband and I took our two-year old for brunch on Saturday and we arrived to a table literally with our name on it. Delicious buffet and family style entrees, great coffee, sangria, tea, juice. Fun and artsy vibe, which only improved when Baron Batch himself arrived. He spent time with guests and was very friendly and conversational.

We enjoyed walking around the art gallery and purchased a canvas. Baron signed it for us and chatted some more before we left. I cannot recommend this place enough.",5
1093,"My favorite things about Vdara in no particular order:

Convenience. You don't have to walk a mile through a crowded casino to the guest elevators because there is no casino! Easy, short walk to the elevators and in your room you go. LIFESAVER if you're a girl in heels and think you might never feel your toes ever again at the end of a long night. 

Kitchenette. A MICROWAVE! Sure, the fridge is tiny and barely cools a drink let alone keep your food at a safe temperature, but it's something. When you have leftovers, it's great to come back in the early morning of partying and just pop it in the microwave and be able to eat in 1 minute time. There's a stove too.. you can request for cooking tools and plates/bowls/etc. 

Room Size and Amenities. This is for the regular room- there's the kitchen area with dining table, a living room with a pull out bed/couch, a queen bed, and a full bathroom with shower and bath. Large windows to enjoy the view. Two televisions! Plus, everything's modern with the touch of Vegas sexy.

Location. To get to Cosmopolitan from Vdara, you exit the hotel and turn left, walk a few feet, go down a flight of stairs, then walk a few more feet and ta-da! you're in front of the Cosmo entrance. Okay. I wish it was closer. But it's not far at all. Actually, we tried to take a taxi from Vdara to Cosmo, and they wouldn't let us. That's how close it is. Aria is just next door too. And there's a tram to Bellagio! 

Rates. Just look it up. Rooms tend to be cheaper than all the other hotels on the strip. Seriously. How? Why? When Vdara is so darn nice!

That's all I can think of for now. I love Vdara and would live here if I could. They do have that option....",5
1095,"All I have to say is Oooooohhhhhh! I was so skeptical but I was not disappointed in anyway. Was better than I expected. The tamales were excellent not as much meat as I would have hoped for, but the moistness and flavor of the masa was on point. And the Menudo were do I start. I like my Menudo sin grano. And they accommodated me. Even asked if I wanted a pata Oooohhhhh it was delicious. This was Definitely worth the drive. And we will definitely be back. Great service too.:)",5
1096,"The Steak and Stone restaurant in Mesa is definitely the most amazing  place to experience gourmet steaks prepared on a hot lava stone. The ambience is a very special one too because you can enjoy breathtaking sunsets falling down  the runways at the the Falcon Field airport. You will be pampered by upbeat and very caring professional staff. Some evenings you may listen to guitar music or sim ilar. My husband and I have been here many times and were thrilled by entire, exceptional, enchanting experience. The best place to celebrate any special occasion with your loved ones. Jitka *********",5
1097,"Am a regular here, food if decent, atmosphere is excellent, beer is cold, and Bianca is awesome!",5
1099,"Before I start: Overweight/normal/small/etc folks don't let some other reviewers steer you wrong. You will not feel intimidated or judged because there are a lot of in shape people here. Frankly, except for the very rare jerk we either do not even notice or care at all what you look like. We all started somewhere, and NO ONE looks down on the 300lb person trying to lose weight, or the skinny kid trying to grow. If you feel judged, it's that you are projecting your own insecurities. On to the review!

I must be getting softer in my old age, as I used to detest this sort of gym. I avoided these nice, shiny, clean, fitness clubs and instead went to divey prison yard type gyms where the ""hardcore lifters"" went. 

Well that preference has changed since switching to Lifetime. After being sick of the lack of maintenance, grimy gym and grimier clientele at Gold's I signed up here and have never looked back. I'll try to be brief since there's many aspects to cover.

Staff: Extremely helpful and pleasant. From the sales staff to the dietician to the cafe people to the janitors every person has greeted me me with a smile and been excellent to deal with. Specifically Travis in sales, and Theresa the dietician have been wonderful.

Facilty/Equipment: Top notch. Well maintained. Clean. A little lacking in free weights compared to the sheer number of machines. Even at peak hours there's enough to go around. Cardio equipment area is the size of most entire gyms.

Clientele: People are friendly and for the most part considerate. I hate to sound elitist, but the fact that this gym is 3 to 5X the cost of Gold's or 24 Hr it serves to weed out the undesirables. There is no women's section because the men aren't creepy and leering so they don't need to hide.

Locker room: CLEAN. Think nice Vegas casino bathroom. No creepy nude men meatgazing all day. Toilets are in their own room, so no foul odors. Separate shower stalls as well. Towels and shampoo/body wash supplied.

Classes: I have not taken any, but my wife loves them. Great instructors, and the classes are on time and not always being switched or cancelled with no notice like at some other gyms. Yoga is included as well, which I intend to try soon. 

Other: Cafe food is excellent. Spa is excellent. One of the best massages I've ever had.",5
1100,If I could give negative stars I would. Dr Sandifer in the ER is the rudest human I have ever met. The nurse Morgan isn't much better. I don't know where the hospital finds these people at but they should start looking elsewhere!  This was the worst hospital visit I have ever had!,1
1101,"Last weekend I decided to go on a hunt to see if I could find a deal worthy of trading in my current car for a newer model. I went to two dealerships because one I was familiar with and closer to my home, and the other had the exact car I wanted. I should have never made that second trip.

I already put car salesman at a lower bar than other people in my mind, but this was a whole new level of low. If you don't want to end your day wanting to staple things to people's heads, I would stay away from this dealership.

I walked into the dealership knowing what I wanted. I still wanted to browse first, but I had researched. This is also not my first car buying experience, and not my first Mazda. I am well aware of the line. Oh yeah, and I'm also a car fanatic. 

I didn't mind being hunted down by a salesman right away because I had really already knew what I wanted. It was coincidental that without saying what I wanted, the first car he decided to show me was the one I had seen in their online inventory. 

Soon enough I was on a test drive. Great car as expected. I asked some simple questions such as if I could have more details on the specifics of the particular perimeter alarm that was installed on that car to which the salesman did not have an answer. Makes me think it would have been fun to ask him what was under the hood.

We all know that what comes next is the fun part. And by fun, I mean extremely annoying process that takes 10 times longer than it should - the negotiating process. The first part was estimating the trade in value of my car though he decided to wrap this up in the first round of pricing negotiations. Right off the bat I was undercut by a couple grand at least on my trade in. Not cool. 

I told him that the trade in value wasn't acceptable and asked if I could find out the specific price plan I was eligible for to which I received a blank look. I would expect a dealership employee to know the various standard pricing plans. I also let him know I wanted to know what other offers were available. After waiting awhile, he came back with no change in the trade in, but did give me the pricing plan I was eligible for.

Since it was still not where it needed to be, I explained to him what I was looking for. I told him my situation and that I did not need to buy a new car. I told him that my car was perfectly fine and in amazing condition and that I wasn't desperate. I let him know the price I had gotten down to at another dealership and where I ideally wanted to be. I said I didn't want to play negotiation games and I wanted to know how close he could get me.

Things quickly got out of line. I was treated with great disrespect as I was given excuse after excuse and attack after attack. At one point he recommended I lease and when I explained to him I did not want to lease I was given a rant of how I don't put enough miles on my car and it's stupid for me to buy. Really? Okay. I'm out then. If that wasn't enough I was also attacked for asking what the lowest price was. I was asked if I wanted the company to lose money all while he kept informing me that he gets paid on commission, which goes by the number of cars he sells. I guess maybe I looked like I didn't know how car dealerships worked and how the car buying process goes. At one point he asked again where I wanted to be payment wise, to which I told him. He then put a range down on a scrap piece of paper with an x and a line below it and told me to sign. When I said I wasn't comfortable signing a scrap piece of paper below a payment price range without any detail or further information, he became very agitated.

In the end I let him know that this wasn't going anywhere and that I didn't think the price was going to be where I needed it to be. I told him that with the economy the way it is, that I figured the price would be lower. When I purchased my other car in a much better economy I was able to get a better deal. I asked if I could have my pricing plan certificate back and was given a very sarcastic, ""You can have whatever you want.""

I was so repulsed by the way I was treated. I emailed customer service at the dealership and never received a response. I cannot believe they would ignore a situation like this, though with the only other review being a 1, I am not that surprised anymore. 

Slightly more detail is available on my blog, but I didn't want to write a novel here unless it was wanted. Oops I guess I already did :)",1
1107,"Nate truly saved the day!!

I had grown up with dogs my whole life and had just gotten my first dog on my own and expected everything to run smoothly, as it always did. My husband and I moved into a new house and my dogs behavior began to change. She became aggressive when we were outside together and even cornered me once. I felt like I had no control and was extremely anxious when I was around her, a feeling I never wanted to feel with my dog. I immediately reached out to Nate who spent a few hours with me over text talking through ways to handle the situation until we could meet up. After our first session I couldn't believe how much better I felt around my dog. We worked on simple day to day activities first like walking on a leash, and not having my arm pulled out of it socket, and how to answer the front door with and excited, anxious dog. We then moved on to the bad behaviors outside and ways to correct her. My dog has truly done a 180 thanks to Nate and has even been given compliments on how well behaved she is. I would recommend Nate to anyone especially if they are struggling with a dog, as they are suppose to bring love and excitement into a home not fear and anxiety! 

Thanks Nate for all you have done!",5
1108,We had a great night here. Ioana was an awesome bartender. Her cocktails were amazing and service was spectacular! Ask for her when you go in!!,5
1109,"This is an excellent barbershop. Regular haircuts are $18 cash only, and they have an ATM in the building. It seems this place has exploded in popularity since I've been going, so I recommend making a reservation a couple weeks out via the Vagaro app. I make my reservations for after I get off work and they usually don't take any walk-ins that late in the day. I would imagine it's not as busy during early/mid afternoon. Joe (the owner) cuts my hair and I've been very pleased with it.",5

1112,"Jeff and the guys are awesome! I have taken my car here for all needs for about a year now.  I have never worked with such a personable and kind repair shop until these guys.  There have been a few times  they  helped me out with last minute/ ""rushed"" fixes and even extended hours just to help.  They understand life happens and they don't give you trouble for it or make you feel in anyway guilty.  

I will continue to come to Crawfords, they are my go to repair shop.  I promise you, you will be happy.  Yelp was the whole reason I started going to them, and so far  they have proven to provide high levels of customer service  over and over again.  Hope this helps you too!",5
1118,Great comfort food -this isn't fancy and doesn't serve drinks but it's good food at a great price,5
1119,"I moved from Chicago just over a year ago.  I do miss the food in Chicago, BUT at least I can explore and find the hidden gems in LV.  I MUST admit, 808 is a hidden/new found treasure for me!  I have tried several Hawaiian restaurants BUT so far HANDS down, 808 is the best!!!  A few days ago was my 1st time checking this spot out.  My son and I decided on the Katsu chicken and garlic chicken.  It was the BOMB.COM!!!  Even the macaroni salad was delicious, as well as, the brown gravy over the rice .... whhaaaatt!!! This place is so good to me, I called later that day and asked if they cater because I am throwing a home warming and 808 dishes will definitely be included in my menu!! ;^)  Thanks 808!!",5
1120,"We are a family who usually don't have good luck with hotels.  We finally picked a good one. I highly recommend this hotel. It isn't located on the strip and it is clean!  The room looks like a mini apartment. It has a huge bathroom with a shower and a whirlpool tub. It has a kitchen with a stove, microwave, full size refrigerator, sink, a lot of cabinets and counter.  It has a living room, separate from the bed room with a sofa that pulls out into a bed, a desk, fireplace, balcony, and a flat screen tv. It even has a washer and dryer inside. The bedroom was nice also. The room has plenty of closet space. This hotel is great for families. It has valet parking only so bring plenty of tip money. It has a restaurant and indoor pool. Great place!!!!",5
1121,"This was my first visit here and I was impressed. It was a free smoothie night, I was greeted cheerfully at the door by and enjoyed all the workers decked out in Hawaiian leis. They had the free drinks prepared and ready to hand out so there was no wait, and my nutritional questions were answered with a smile. I would definitely return for some of the yummy looking menu items.",5
1122,"Do not, I repeat, do NOT rent a car from this place. If you are flying into Toronto and expecting this car rental to be in the airport, it is not. If you're flying international, you will have to take a shuttle to a different terminal and then call them to be picked up. 
I was aware of the need to be picked up, however I was not aware of needing to find the shuttle and take it to a different terminal.
I was also not aware of the need to have proof of car insurance, otherwise being forced to buy car insurance from them. Interestingly, this policy only applied to me. As I spoke to other unhappy renters, they were not being forced into purchasing insurance. They were however being charged for pre-existing scratches on the car. And had to go through an ordeal of proving it. The service rep didn't even bother pulling up the initial paperwork before abusing the renter of scratching the car. Another story I heard was a renter being charged a $1000 hold, instead of the standard $500. But I guess there is no standard procedure here. Reps do as they please? 
Another irk is getting the car with half a tank and needing to return it the same. I have never heard of a car rental requiring a half a tank of gas upon return. Honestly feels like a scam as well, you'll either overfill for them or come a little bit under and likely get charged for it. 
Failure on my part was not checking yelp before booking. And since you're reading this review, you didn't make the same mistake. Good for you!",1
1123,"The best cleaning job I've seen in years!!! Louise and his team were thorough, professional, and punctual. I have recommended Eco Friend Carpet Care to all of my friends and family because they are the best. Don't listen to me though. See for yourself. The results will speak for themselves.",5
1124,"Dr. Kelly England was very controlling and rude. Our questions were regarded as threatening I guess. For one example, my son was uncomfortable with a procedure and when I asked her why she needed to do it she made no attempt to be reassuring or give any information, she just said, ""it is my job!"" I supported my son and asked her not to do it, so she said I need to find another doctor. 

In addition we had to wait in the lobby for 40 minutes and it was an hour total before we saw Dr. Kelly England. I have definitely experienced medical office staff that was far more professional and friendly than this office too. The office we went to was1450 South Dobson Road, Suite B220.

I canceled my other kids' appointments and we will never go back!",1
1126,I love this place!  Recently moved here from Los Angeles and Im so happy to have a great Italian restaurant nearby!  Love the pizza and the cassata cake is the best!  Lisa the owner is always super friendly and helpful too.  Have gone back often and look forward to many more visits in the future!,5
1127,I would rate it zero if that was an option. Complete ripoff. Don't use it. Force you to pay for insurance unless you bring your insurance card. Ridiculous security deposit held on cards. Staff are unfriendly and could not care any less about the service. Total joke. Pay more and get quality,1

1129,After not answering the phone and having a full voicemail box for a day this company did get back to me and sent out a plumber. The plumber went to my rental property where they had 2 clogged drains. He unclogged one and left without cleaning up. He didn't give a time he would return. I called the company and no one returned my call to schedule a time to finish the job. I only used this plumber because my warranty company contracts them. I ultimately had to call another plumber to fix the problem and ended up paying twice.,1
1130,"Each time I go to BWW which is once a year I am reminded why I dislike it so much. The food is not appealing nor eatable. The atmosphere seems dirty even for a sports bar.

1131,This was my 3rd trip to TacoMac. I travel to Charlotte for business often. Great casual place to hang out and watch a game. Great bar and unbelievable draft beer selection.  Marty and Brandon behind the bar make every visit great.  Great guys and very knowledgeable about beer.  Most bars don't have great service like this.  Dont expect gourmet food - but the food is good with plenty of choices.,5
1132,"Good service department in general. Small but comfortable waiting area, always stocked with water, coffee, donuts, fruit, and sometimes other goodies. Thoughtful.

I have never purchased a car here though, so I cannot speak about their sales staff other than to say they have never bothered me while I was in for a service visit.",5
1133,"The best pho I ever had. It tasted fresh and probably no MSG either. I always get really thirsty when I get pho at other places because they have so much MSG in their soup. They didn't have seafood pho on the menu, but they were able to make it anywase and I really enjoyed it!!!!",5
1135,"Now this is a Ross store! Huge and plenty of items for men as well as women. Two floors, I found more here in an hour then most other Ross stores I've shopped combined; for men. A great way to save a little cash when shopping in Vegas.",5

When I asked she said that they were done for the day (it was 2 in the afternoon on a Tuesday) I then said that I was going to come in on Wednesday morning. The woman told me that no they won't do it.... I'm guessing this company does not want money.... I wouldn't have written this except for the fact that she was rude over the phone. I'm guessing it's customer service at it best....,1
1140,"Our favorite place to stay on the strip.  From the rooms to the restaurants, to the staff - - all are exceptional.  Wish they would bring back the better shows (Phantom, Jersey Boys, Blue Man Group) vs what they have today.  Also wish they'd bring back the pillows from several years ago - those were amazing.   Overall, you can't go wrong staying at the Palazzo.",5
1142,"Rocco is the best. He is so personable and professional. He has great communication when scheduling and even the day of about arrival time. 
He did such a beautiful job cleaning my sofa. I didn't have any stains, but with 2 dogs I knew it was due for a good cleaning, deodorizer and sanitizer. 
Rocco followed up to ensure I was satisfied once the sofa dried (took a couple days due to the fabric) 
He specializes in sofas and upholstery. 
Call him next time you need a professional cleaning. You won't be disappointed. 
He is good honest man running a great small business in our city. I will be sure to share his info with friends.
Thanks Rocco.",5
1145,"The hotel experience was pretty great in my opinion. There are various restaurants that visitors can dine in throughout the day , as well as an in door aquarium with a virtual reality experience that is perfect for kids of all ages. During my stay I had one issue which occurred during the second day of our stay at the hotel . It was around 6 in the morning and my family and I were getting ready for our trip to the Grand Canyon . We tried to be as quiet as possible but it wasn't good enough for the people in the room next to us and they called hotel security with a noise complaint. Hotel security came up to our room to tell us that we were disturbing the people in the room next to us . When hotel security arrived to ""reprimand "" us the person next door to us opened their room door to complain about how loud we were being but made sure to stay inside their room so we couldn't see their faces . After hotel security left we organized our selves and left for our trip . When we returned someone put a Do Not Disturb sign on our door , and because of this our room was not cleaned for the day . We were livid and informed the hotel cleaning crew but we didn't see any results. Regardless our trip was a lot of fun asides from the issue we had with the people in the room next to us.",5
1147,"There were hardly any customers in the restaurant and yet the bartender couldn't listen or take the time to get my order right. Very disappointing. And the French fries are terrible. Burger ok, but not great. Real problem was the the bartender couldn't care less.",1
1148,"I stopped here with my husband the other night while we were in town and loved it! It was in the evening which made the already gorgeous cars even prettier. This is the first time I've seen Lamborghinis close up vs going down a street so I was very excited! Clearly I didn't touch them but loved looking at them. I loved how well kept the dealership and lot was too. They had what seemed to be a private event inside at the time, but that's fine too. Just shows how individualized their customer care is! I hope to return soon!",5
1149,"I'm not sure exactly what part of Walmart repulses me; the horrible crowd of shoppers it attracts (leisurely browsing isles, talking loudly on cell phones while blocking everyone in a rush to get by) the employes who would clearly rather be anywhere else or the ONE (!!!!) open register to serve 1,500 people standing in line, but seriously, I will go in ANY direction, but the local Walmart. Totally out of my way, even in another city, even to pay higher prices, I avoid this Walmart. Super sad. I use to love Walmart.",1
1152,This is our favorite breakfast/brunch spot. The food is always excellent as well as the drinks. It had a fun atmosphere.,5
1153,called these guys for a repair on my icemaker. they were super quick to come out and fixed within a few minutes. even explained and showed me how to fix it if it ever happens again. super honest down to earth people. will use them again for any appliance relairs in the future!,5
1157,"I have had two dogs and would never take them  anywhere other than McGilvray. A fantastic animal hospital, with amazing vets and is one of the few animal hospitals accredited by the American Animal Hospital Association. On Monday, I took my terrier Gracie to see Dr. Tate because she had been vomiting and had had diarrhea for the past three days. Gracie was diagnosed with pancreatitis, and admitted to the hospital and three days later came out and is better than ever. I am so thankful for the amazing staff of McGilvrays. They are amazing. We are lucky to have a place of this quality in Toronto.",5
1158,Went here last night the food is excellent. Great introduction to Thai food.  I had the chicken pepper steak and the papaya salad.  Excellent choice!,5
1159,I bought the eat all day deal for $35. I ate the Excalibur buffet for dinner. It was terrible!! I'm grateful I didn't get food poisoning. The selection was terrible: sad looking crab legs and meatballs that looked like they had better days. Save your money for the casinos.,1
1160,"They do a great job with awesome turn around times.  I have had them dry clean, launder, and alter many items for me. I will continue to do business with them.",5
1161,"First time here. Was offered hot tea before my massage. Received my own private room. Very dim lightening & nice calm music. Made myself comfortable on a recliner. Coco brought in a bucket of hot water & put my feet in. Pretty hot at first & then nice. Coco cover my upper body in a nice warm towel. Then she lowered the recliner a little, put a pillow on my lower back and told me to relax. She massage my shoulders, neck, ears, head & then face with plumeria lotion. She lowered the recliner all the way, to where it was flat. She informed me it was optional to remove clothing before back massage. Then I laid flat on my tummy. She massage my shoulders and neck more & massage my entire back, glutes, & asked if I wanted my back walked on (heck yes!!..as I whispered ""just don't break me""). She was a small lady and the walk felt great. Then she massaged my arms, hands and legs. She asked if I wanted hot stones for $4 (of course!). OMG! Amazing!!! Then after my massage I was offered more hot tea. Wasn't rushed out of there. Met Coco in the front & left a deserved tip. Thank you! I will definitely recommend coco & Best Foot Spa.",5
1162,"Troy came out today to our house to check our AC.  Prepared for the worst, I was extremely surprised at his patience and willingness to explain things in a way I could understand.  Troy told us what needed to be fixed but didn't pressure us into fixing it.  He showed a genuine compassion for helping us by offering options.  It was refreshing to have a company actually care about you as a customer instead of just as a way to make money.  Keep up the great work and make sure to keep employees like Troy happy!!  They are an asset to your company.",5
1165,"If your heart's desire is either Mexican menudo or pozole, this is THE spot in Las Vegas! Their cuisine is authentic to the core. Make sure to try their homemade tortillas; their bolillos con mantequilla are as delicious. When you visit, ask for Arlene. She was super nice and helpful.",5
1167,"Thank you, Okra, for introducing me to the Vieux Carre! I am in love with this drink. I actually made a small batch version and gave it as a gift to a fellow whiskey lover this past holiday season. No worries: I told the recipient to go to Okra: the inspiration. You keep me coming back for more: I dream of working my way through the cocktail menu... I want to try them all!

I seriously love the cocktail menu here because it introduces me to such a great variety of drinks: traditional and original. 

Food-wise, I highly recommend: 
the mac and cheese balls 
the country ham & hoe cakes
the pimento burger - my current choice for best burger in the Valley!",5
1168,"Trying all the sliders - totally worth it!  My favorite was the Mac Daddy, but probably because we just moved back to the Carolinas from Colorado and I was missing some of that good old southern mac & cheese.  The Amaze Balls was true to its name... amaze balls.  If you're into sweet, savory, and the perfect combination between the two, Sugar Daddy's is where you need to be.  My husband really enjoyed the Pig Candy from the Sugar Daddy slider - if he could buy it by the bag, he would. ;)

If we lived closer to the area, I would definitely be visiting this food truck often!!",5
1170,"Love this place.  The service is quick and friendly, the tap list may be small but it is always mighty - my most recent visit included trying New Belgium's Tart Lychee beer.  Yum.  My friend and I had been biking downtown and dodging storms and we approached right as they were about to close.  One of the servers happened to overhear my friend (recently moved back to OH) say she'd always wanted to try it and he insisted that we stay.  We both had the Fiery Dan Dan noodles, I like mine with a 6-minute egg and it was delicious as always (not my first visit).  This is definitely one of my favorite spots downtown.  I love the upbeat atmosphere and know I can count on great tunes overhead accompanying my meal.  Our experience there, both the food, service, and atmosphere definitely helped sell my friend on the downtown CLE experience!  Thanks, Noodlecat!!!",5
1171,"So glad I found this place! Very clean and nice inside, they cut my kids hair just how they wanted it and super fast! Reasonably priced too. We'll be back!",5
1173,"My wife and little boy went to Healing Hearts around 1:00pm on 4/13/2016 because my son had been throwing up, vomiting, and had a high fever (son is almost 2 years old).  My wife was not received by a doctor, but by Sonia the Nurse Practitioner and she diagnosed my son with having an ear infection. 

Sonia asked my wife which pharmacy she preferred, my wife told her the Walgreens on Alma School and Guadalupe.  Before leaving, my wife asked for the prescription and the nurse said that they would call and order it in and to not worry about it, that they would get it taken care of.  

Around 4:45pm that same day, my wife didn't hear anything from Walgreens so she called the pharmacy and they said that nothing had been ordered yet.  My wife, knowing that Healing Hearts would close quickly, called them and they said that it had been ordered at the Walgreens on Dobson and Warner.  My wife told them No and that it needed to be ordered at Alma School and Walgreens.  

Later that evening, we went to Walgreens and we were told that they didn't have any record that the prescription had been ordered.  Worried, we went to the other Walgreens on Dobson and Warner and they said the same thing.  Thinking there may have been a mistake in the pharmacy company, we even went to CVS but none of their locations showed anything was ordered.  After driving around for an hour and a half, I began to realize that Healing Hearts never ordered the prescription.  HEALING HEARTS NOT ONLY DIDN'T ORDER THE PERSCRIPTION, THEY LIED ABOUT ORDERING IT. 

To put it simply--my son had a nasty fever all night, the vomitings continued, and he slept that night roughly an hour.    

The following morning, 4/14/2016, I called Healing Hearts to speak with a manager or doctor so that I could file a complaint.  I spoke with Tatiana who told me that Sonia wouldn't be in until 9:30am, and that the office manager Vick and the doctor had a meeting and she would have them call me back.  I asked who is responsible for ordering prescriptions and she told me it would be the doctor/nurse that attended us--in this case Sonia  I called the other location in Gilbert to inquire about where I could file a complaint and said that all complaints needed to go through the Chandler office administrator Vick.  I was transferred to his voicemail.

Vick called me back, and then in a defensive tone he proceeded to tell me that he shows that it was ordered electronically and that they would order it again to make sure it went through.  Who am I to hold responsible, Walgreens or Healing Hearts?  There comes a certain point where you have to take responsible for your errors and mistakes, don't blame the technology when your offices customer service is reprehensible.    

To say the least, my family will NEVER go back after experiencing what happened with Healing Hearts and Sonia.  I would not be surprised if this problem is just tip of the iceberg for the real issues happening there.

Yours Truly, 

A Dissatisfied Arizona Parent.",1

We had the 5$ tacos which were good but for 5$ and discounted (Taco Tuesday) not that special!

1181,"i took my 12' mazda 3 in for a trans service and oil change. I was told by two employees that they could do the trans service and while doing it would do an oil change. I was quoted $159 for the trans and $54.95 for the synthetic oil change. It would be $39.95 if I didn't want synthetic oil. I made an appointment and showed up to drop the car off and again was told they could do the trans. service. Imagine my surprise when they called to say it was done and they could not do the trans service. They did not have the right adapters. They also charged me $83  for the oil change. More than the dealer. I only took it in for the trans. service and would have taken it to the dealer to start with, if they had not lied. They overcharged me for the oil change and were completely dishonest. When I complained, the employee said she was not authorized to change the fees. I needed the car and had to pay to get it. Not a nice place.",1
1182,"We have been coming to this place for the past month now and love it. Good happy hour, good food, and the live music on the weekend nights is great! Oliver the manager has always been hospitable and his staff has always treated us well. We are glad we found this hidden gem.",5
1183,I will be honest. If you want to get in and out COME EARLY!!!!! Don't get there at 8am and think you'll be out in an hour. I got here at 7am to take my permit test and was out around 9am. I see some people had really bad experiences but the workers I had were really helpful and nice. The only person that I could have done without was an annoying lady at the photo station checking documents.,5
1184,"My family and I had to move into an apartment while we save to buy our home. We wanted to feel safe. So we called Safe and secure. Let me tell you their name completely says it all.¬† Johns was very professional. He took his time to completely understand my family's needs and provided me with exactly what I wanted. I have an alarm and cameras for inside and out. It's a wonderful feeling knowing that family is protected all the way around. My favorite feature that I used continuously is the live feed that i have directly from my phone. I can see what my dogs are doing, what my children are up to if they are home. I get text messages as soon as the alarm is set, and disabled.¬† From my initial consultation and throughout my many questions regarding the different features my equipment offered or the upgrades I wanted to have installed john and his office staff were right there to answer them all. Great company that provides Great service gets a 5 star review from me....",5

1188,"I drive a 2010 Range Rover Sport,My check engine Light came on & I took my truck to my local mechanic, he advised me after scanning the car that I had a problem with 4 ignition coils and to take it to a Land Rover Dealer as they have a Land Rover scanner and can give me better diagnosis. I searched online for Land Rover mechanic & found BIRKSHIRE Automobiles advertising as a Land Rover Dealer Alternative, I phoned them and I explained to them the situation, they told me that they had a Land Rover scanner and it will tell them the exact problem after they scan my car (more detailed report than the Regular mechanic generic scanner). I made the appointment and went there, They scanned the car and the same results that I already knew were on their diagnosis report, the only difference was in the bottom of the report it said: customer to Call US. they charged me 1 hour labour and they refused to refund me, they informed me that will contact their Tech team in England and try and figure out  what the problem is and will get back to me within 3 days!!!.  I then called Metro West AUTHORIZED Dealer and gave them the codes and they told me over the phone what needs to be fixed.  I did give Birkshire a 1 star because the washroom was very clean and Sam spent a few minutes in my car showing me some controls, however; he didn't know all the controls and what they are made for.  I advise any Land Rover owner to take their truck to the Dealer at least for diagnosis at least for sure they know all the controls not half or so.  Hope you found my review helpful.",1
1189,"Wow, what a waste of time this was.  I went in with an honest picture of a divorce and problems up front.  I asked to be pre-approved before I started looking at cars with the understanding that this just might not happen.  They were all friendly and respectful... to my friend who went with me.  He has a mechanics background.  They shook his hand three times.  I was the one buying the car and was never offered this common courtesy. I really try not to be that kind of woman, but... Then they tried to sell me a Mustang that was posted on their internet inventory as clean and ready to go.  It had been driven by the wife of one of the people who work there, with major dents on the roof, a rear bumper that had significant damage, an obvious oil leak, and a questionable CARFAX report.  

They wanted me to make a promise to buy it that they would clean it up and make it ready to go.  We asked that if we were approved for that car and it didn't work out, that the offer would be good for another car of that price.  They said yes. But they wanted me to sign that I would buy that car... hmmmm.  Couldn't test drive it and it had problems...  Well, they brought out the credit guy, who once again talked to my friend instead of me, and shook his hand twice, but not mine.  The numbers did not match what was advertised at all.  There was $1000 added on to the price, now making a car that had a Kelley Blue Book value of $3400 from $6700 to $7700.  They said the higher price was a loan fee.  I was sitting under the sign that said ""We use Kelley Blue Book values to price our cars"".  Obviously not the same blue book the rest of us use.

The moral of this story is, do your homework to know the value of your purchase before you buy from these guys... and ladies, you might want to bring a guy with you so you don't have to shake their hands either.",1
1190,"We are new in town and haven't had the opportunity to interview Pediatrician's in the area. My youngest son fell ill with a bad cough/congestion so I took him to Southwest Medical Urgent Care, which also just happens to be 1.1 miles from where we currently live. From check in to check out the front desk staff Catherine was pleasant and professional, Dr. Litman attended to my son, he was very attentive about my concerns and addressed them immediately to his staff. After a chest X-ray, my baby had pneumonia. They administered Albuterol mist and ibuprofen for his fever. A few days later Dr. Litman personally called me to see how my baby was doing and suggested I take him in for a follow up/check up the next week. That means the world to me that he took time out in his busy schedule to call. Less than two weeks later, I received a letter in the mail from Dr. Litman thanking me for selecting them for my urgent care needs. I am now in the process of looking into a Pediatrician from their medical group in the same building. Keep up the great work!",5

There's stylist out there that don't listen to what you want and what you're going for and instead try to push their own styles and opinions on you. Denise is just the opposite.

Portion - definitely decent!!!

I ordered the lunches online and there were substitutions, which they took no note of, but the gal was very sweet and brought the correct salad to my office.

Next time you are thinking of stopping at the corporate coffee place do something different and give this place a shot. I can honestly say they have better coffee and better service. 

Also check out the live music on the weekends. Free to watch and the bands are actually quite impressive. Fun little place to hang out at or even for a quick latte on  the way to work. Also, they have a nice little selection of pastries baked fresh by a local bakery. Prices are way reasonable for a hip little place too.",5
1220,"I am a huge Teriyaki chicken fan, so I tried this place based on Yelp reviews.  My fellow yelp'ers weren't far off the mark.  I ordered the white meat Teriyaki Chicken bowl with brown rice, along with a pork egg roll and a large drink.  The meal arrived at my table quickly.  Upon first bite, I was taken aback because the teriyaki sauces I've tried are really, really sweet.  This sauce is not as sweet, but much more flavorful.  The egg roll was good, but the sweet/sour sauce it came with was better than I've ever had.  Simple, sweet, and not gooey or gloopy.  

One of the owners (a wonderfully pleasant aging Japanese woman) came to my table and offered me chopsticks and hot mustard -- we had a delightful conversation wherein she explained that the chicken is hormone-free and char-grilled over pumice stones, and their sauces are home-made from family recipes.  They also offer many healthy options, including brown rice and vegetarian dishes, and NO MSG IS ADDED!!  She was a fantastic host.  

Everyone seemed to be hurrying around, but they were all doing a great job keeping the customers happy by refilling drinks, delivering orders and making conversation with the people inside and outside the shop.

All in all, a great experience.  I told the owner I would be back with my son by the end of the week, and I plan to keep my promise!  Great job, Blue Fin!",5

The portion sizes are huge for one person, but maybe it's just all my years of eating crappy food which makes me think ""damn, I still have more vegetables to eat?"" I've liked everything except the berry porridge, which had a weird texture for me. Choosing meals for the week is easy, ingredient lists are comprehensive so I can check for allergens, portions are good, and shipping is reliable. Although, OnTrac never tells me when the delivery arrives. For roughly $7 a meal, it's a great alternative for eating lunch out (which gets pricey in a downtown office)!",5

They pop up as a Google ad pay per click , when I called I asked a few times making sure it was the correct price I had a bad feeling from start as it was hard to get a straight answer.

The bathroom floor looked like it had been cleaned with barb-wire, There was a water stain that looked like it had been there for years in the corner of the room.

The closet door and toilet were not working properly, the list goes on. The entire hotel smelled like weed, from the employees, to the rooms.

AMAZING to say the least; I'm truly blessed and honored to have his talent on permanent display. I followed him all the way from Los Angeles and I came to know the nicest, most professional shop I've ever come across. I am considered a tattoo collector and have work from some of the most renowned names in the industry, from some of the world famous shops, particularly from Los Angeles. In all honesty, Skin Design Tattoos is the premier shop. It sets the bar so high that no other shop can touch it. In terms of professionalism, they define excellence. From the appointment setting process, the deposit taking, the reminders via email and text, to the after care follow up instructions (Mario you're the man!)  they know what they are doing and they are doing it right! The artists that are all here are experts in their respective fields and talents whether it be color (Vic Vivid), portraits and black and gray (Robert Pho/Andy Pho/Fernie Andrade) or custom lettering (David Ruiz), they have every aspect covered...up to and including cleaning up and removing unwanted work with their tattoo removal service (Anthony). 

I without hesitation and with the utmost pride and honor highly recommend you give Skin Design Tattoos your business when you decide you want to get that permanent ink. The saying goes, ""A good tattoo isn't cheap and a cheap tattoo isn't good"" rings truer now than ever. Invest wisely and you will never reap regret!

1245,"Stopped in once to ask about my laptop battery not charging (I had read Dell Diagnostics and support threads, but wanted to take it in first before I got into buying parts). The visit was probably 10 minutes and the guy at the counter literally just turned the computer on to see the ""not charging"" message, turned it off and directed me to Batteries Plus. Needless to say I was a bit surprised, but I thought maybe he was trying to save me some money. 

So off to Batteries Plus I go, where the only battery they had in stock wasn't a complete match and did not work on my system. They offered to order me a replacement battery for $170, but I figured I could get a better deal online. So I ordered a replacement battery and AC adapter just in case. Both come and I try them with no success. My computer won't recognize the new battery. While testing all this I realized that there was a BIOS update I needed, but wouldn't run because my Dell battery didn't have enough charge and the replacement battery wasn't recognized. 

So I went back to Data Doctors with all the parts and explanation of what I had found. I suppose I should have turned around as soon as they couldn't take my credit card info because their router was down (not good for an IT/computer company to have IT issues). For some reason they asked to keep the replacement AC adapter, but not the replacement battery only to call me 2 days later and ask for the battery (never mind that their hours mean I am late to work if I have to stop by). So by Friday afternoon, after having my computer for 5 days, I called to check on it because 5 days seemed like an awful long time to have my laptop. They told me almost word for word what I told them was the problem on Day 1. The diagnosis was that I needed a Dell battery and not a generic replacement. It took them 5 days to tell me that. 

They also told me they had discovered some Trojan viruses on my computer. I was skeptical since I have been shelling out money to McAfee for years. So when I got my computer back I ran a scan, which came back negative, but when looking at the scanning history, I was reminded that McAfee did find 4 viruses 2 YEARS AGO and had quarantined them.

I am glad I got my laptop back when I did and am sorry I didn't ask for a refund because the only thing Data Doctors did for me was prevent me from having a usable laptop for a week. I certainly don't need them to order me a Dell battery, when I can do that myself. I was under the mistaken idea that a computer repair company would have spare parts to test systems so that I could have diagnosed the issue before having to go out an replace parts one by one. I should have called my company's IT department back in Virginia because they would have been more helpful.

I can't speak to other locations, but I will never patronize the Ahwatukee store again. I did ultimately resolve the problem when I found PHX CPU. Since I had pretty much done all my own diagnostics, I realized it was either the DC power jack or motherboard. Thankfully, it was the former and PHX CPU replaced my power jack and my laptop is running perfectly again.",1

We had a huge feast and just tried a few dishes including the shrimp fried rice, subgum chicken fried rice (To Die For), wonton soup,crab rangoon, wings(crisp and very flavorful),California sushi rolls, the duck sauce was outstanding. Service was perfect and on point plus the place itself was very cute and I would say perfect for a date or even just to hit their bar.. oh that reminds me their plum wine i's KILLER!! I LOVE THIS PLACE!   I'll be back again in the future.",5

Our server's name is Sunshine. That is actually her legal name!.  She was simply amazing, from making great recommendations and accommodating a few special requests, and just being present, she was awesome.

I know this place has a reputation for being crazy expensive, but I had a $22 lunch that included an authentic Caesar salad and a 10 ounce New York strip.  I think that's very good value! Portion sizes were good, unfortunately because I feel really full.

We sat on the patio and had great people watching as well.",5

1254,"This place is the real deal. It's pretty similar to other Italian restaurants in Vegas, but I've come here six times - and all of my experiences have never disappointed. Food always come out nice and hot. Deli offers so many great cold cuts to take home. The owner (Fausto) is such a sweet and gentle man. Super fun to talk to. Nick has been my waiter each time I've come here and he is super efficient. This is definitely a place I'd recommended! 5 stars!",5
1255,Probably on of the best steaks I have had in a long time.  I had a filet medium well with the peppercorn sauce and I could tear it apart with my fork--yes medium well!  Great flavor!  The other side dishes were perfect including even the smallest things like the bread.  The deserts everyone got were good.  The service excellent and what made the experience the best was I did not have to pay!,5

If your looking for a quick pit stop mid day, to go pickup or even ordering your weekly meal prep... this is your place Togo!!

I live less than ten minutes from this restaurant. Seriously, if this store wants to continue business then perhaps they need to fix their delivery system since it is atrocious.",1

There are still menu items I need to try like calzones, subs and pasta dishes.",5
1268,"First visit in and it was not a good one, AT ALL. I decided to try a Carnitas Torta. For those unaware, basically a Pork Sandwich Mexican style. It seemed as though they had no idea what to do. First, the guy up front walks me through what I want on it, then he hands it off to some mysterious person in the back. My GF gets the Veggie Burrito. We also used the special Yelp offer for an order of the Free Mini Churros. The girl at the cash register was very nice but seems a bit stumped by the whole ordeal. So we are told to sit down and they will bring me my Torta. The GF is about 2/3's of the way through with her Veggie Burrito when my Torta magically arrives at our table. All the while her Veggie Burrito is starting to fall apart from all of the juices/oil, we aren't sure. I unwrap my Torta to discover it is one sloppy, congealed mess. Not very appetizing to look at and fell apart at my 1st bite. Flavor was ok but the whole thing was just a disaster. I took it back up and had them make me a Carnitas Burrito. It was marginally better but the same as with my GF's Veggie Burrito, it fell apart about halfway through. And that's about as much as I ate. We dumped the remainder into the trash and agreed never to visit a Chronic Taco ever again.

Then the Store Manager came out. He knew we had a bad experience and wanted to know what all went wrong. He also informed us that this store was the numero uno location in all of Chronic Taco. We told him everything as written above. He also said he was in there with his family trying to have lunch and it was a miserable failure at best. He was a nice enough guy and offered for us to come back at another time after he addresses the issues all free of charge. Not that is the right thing to do. But honestly, there's a whole lotta fixin needs to happen before that place is right. Maybe we will check it out again and give them another chance, but I highly doubt it. Investors, if this is the best store they have, get your money out fast because that ship is sinking.",1

1272,"A girl from Toronto and hungry after a great golf round. 

Boyfriend and I decided to see what was good in the north. We came across The Lion and pulled in for a drink and tried the spinach and artichoke dip. That is a whole new story but long story short ""The chips are suppose to taste stale"". I jumped on my handy yelp and saw this place, which was right next door. We walked in and everyone was enjoying the jays games and cheering together. What a great atmosphere. I got a small burger (1 patty) with provolone cheese and bacon. Two words. LIFE CHANGING. What a great burger. The Nguyen brothers really know what they are doing. From their fresh well-seasoned patty to their outstanding sauces. Just amazing. I have tried all ""the"" burger joints. Burger priest, shake shack, P&L, Holy Chuck, The Burger Shack, and Five Guys. This is the best burger. I am so happy that I found this place. Will be back when I'm around for golf. 

Happy belly!!",5

TUESDAY WINGS AT BOOKERS!!!!  lb of wings for $4.99
THEY SMOKE THE WINGS!!!!

They had me at this selling point.  So a group of 10 at a table...now before I go on further, this turned out to be one of the worst wing nights we've ever had.  It even came to the point we were outside talking about how we will do our next chicken fry for July or August.  So for the few of us drinks came, for others they were waiting for quite a bit...meaning 20-25 minutes.  So not really starting off with a good experience.

So finally our drinks came and we look over the menu,  Everyone was coming to an agreement they were ready to order.  Unfortunately we were not attended to for 20 minutes.  This caused for one of us to approach the bar to have the bartender send over the waitress.  That took another 20 minutes til we got our order taken.

So we gave our orders to the waitress.  Keep in mind its 16 orders of wings.  There were 2 entree orders, 5 side orders of jalapeno mac and cheese, and an order of fries.  Not to bad of an order for the night and drinks.

So by now its coming to an hour and 15 minutes, we are antsy for our food.  Our waitress came out to tell us our food is coming and explained that instead of individual plates for the wings, it would be grouped.  This meaning wings would be on a platter.  She also indicated the wings are not tossed in sauce, individual sauce cups will be given.

So we nod and smile and finally the food starts coming out, they give 3 platters of wings and a platter of various sauces in a cup.  For the people who ordered salt and pepper wings, the shakers are in the middle of the table.  Salt and pepper the wings themselves....FAIL!!!!!  The girl who dropped off the sauces to us didn't even take the time to tell us which sauce was which:  Buffalo, Carolina, Kansas City, or Maple Bourbon....FAIL!!!!  Don't get me wrong I think we were able to figure the sauces out from sampling.

So as we are eating, we notice that the wings were gone pretty fast.  Now out of the 10 of us, 6 of us order 2 lbs of wings.  Now don't think we were being petty but the amount of wings we ate in total came up to approx 75 wings.  I asked the waitress how many wings usually come with a pound.  she advised 8-10 wings.  so in my calculation that would be based on 8 wings each 128 pieces.  So if  ""WE ARE COUNTING WINGS"" per the manager we are still short 51 wings.  As the waitress was about to clear our table, I asked her about the wings and that we may short wings as customer.  She asked if we wanted more, but we decided that what ever was brought out to us they can charge, what was not brought, just take it off the bill.

15 minutes later this guy with his ball cap backwards approaches us.  He indicated he was the manager, cool, brought to his attention we might short of wings in our order.  He gave us the same option for them to bring out the remaining wings or what we would like.  We just asked if they could remove the wings that were not brought out.  He then turned and may have muttered the f-bomb.  I wasn't the only one who heard, but also another person.

So we are sitting at our table, the table hasn't been cleared.  We are waiting for our bill.  The waitress comes and asks how many orders need to come off the bill.  We didn't know what to say as how do you measure a pound out by wings that are already eaten.  So we went off by their estimates of wings per order ratio.  8-10.  Unfortunately an agreement could not be made of how many orders to be taken off.  So essentially it was agree 8 orders of wings to be charged.  So the waitress was gonna seperate the bill.  The bill came back with us being charged 9 orders.  We asked if it was 8 and she said she would make the correction.

Another 20 minutes roll and the manager comes back and asks if we have finished counting wings....seriously ok, yah I can take a joke.  But I can't speak for the other people and it came down to 2 guys at our table vs the manager, I was stuck in between.  So the manager was saying we wanted him to take off another order of wings.  He even said he already taken off half the bill???  Umm lets see 5 bucks times 8 orders....$40...Thats not half the orders we made.  Pretty much he indicated to us he will get the bill corrected and have us leave their establishment....Really?  

Ok, so yah we were not feeling it so we got the bill which the waitress seperated for us.  There were issues with certain orders mixed with other peoples bills...lets just pay and get the hell out.

So after reading this I hope you didn't spend 2 hours and 30 minutes reading this because that was how long it was for our experience with Bookers.  

You know whats even funny, before we even went, talked about the all you can eat crab special,  sundays $42.95, not no more.  3 of us that were planning on going.  Thats approx 126.00 for food, plus drinks and tip not being spent there.

God bless and happy eating....somewhere else!!!",1
1278,"I don't typically leave negative reviews unless I am super dissatisfied or very, very disappointed.  My husband and I came in for a full body massage. We originally wanted the 1 hour massage (price on the board was $36), so we thought okay, that's fine. Then the guy up front, said 'how about 75 minutes more for $3 more?' I said, 'Okay, sure, what the heck, it's only three dollars more"". And considering the reviews, it was supposedly great! 

So, I go to alot of massage places and what I tend to do, is, I look at the time, right before they put their hands on me. In this case, it was 3:50 p.m. So, I'm counting the 75 minutes after which should be roughly 4:05 p.m. the staff is nice, understandable.  They had me soak my feet in the bucket (I'm Asian so I go to a whole lot of Asian massage places. When they tell you to stick your foot in the bucket first, it's considered a foot massage, which is usually cheaper) the other Asian places, when I ask for full body, I'm laying on my back with a sheet over me, and they literally spend 40 minutes on my back and maybe the remaining 20 for the entire body. 

When he walked in again, I asked him again, 'this is a deep tissue back massage right? (or full body, NOT foot massage)'.  He said 'yes, yes, we do back 30 minutes'. Of course the girl that was massaging my husband didn't understand a lick of English so she couldn't respond. So I was thinking, okay maybe they do it differently. So we went on with it.  

During the massage, my massage guy (grant it he's nice) but business is business, if you don't have time to sit and do my massage you should get someone else. OR get someone else to tend the front desk.  He kept walking in and out throughout MY MASSAGE which could've cut off a good 10 minutes. (And no it wasn't to get the supplies, because when I look over to my husband, his girl was still massaging him). He would come back to apologize for leaving, so I said no prob, BUT also thinking, 'oh, maybe he'll make up the time in the end.'

Anyhow, time goes by, when I had to flip on my belly so my back is up, I took a glance at the clock again and I was thinking okay there's technically 25 minutes left, so he'll probably use the remaining  for the back. 

He only rubbed my back, didn't get under the shoulder blades, didn't single out any muscle areas, he literally just rubbed up and down my back with both hands... that's all. Didn't work in sections, like others do. So when, they say, 'okay, done'. I asked aloud ""that was 75 minutes?"" He responds, 'yeah'. I looked over to the clock and it was just barely tipping past 4:50 p.m. (that was 60 minutes, not 75!). I looked, over to my husband and said, that wasn't even our full time. So I'm thinking, I'm just going to tip $5 each, but since I didn't have two $5 bills, I had a $10 and $5, so $7.50 each now, because this is not what we expected!! And even considering giving tip, should be good already, thinking back how I DIDN'T EVEN GET MY FULL TIME WITH HIM WALKING AWAY AND COMING BACK! 

So when we walk to the front, the girl gave us the 60 minute price, my guy corrected her and says, in Chinese, 'no it was the 75 minute. So she charged me for that.  Then she asked, 'cash or credit for tip?' We said cash, and handed them the $15 to split (because at this point I'm displeased with my service) usually I always tip $10+, not in this case.  When we handed the cash, the guy said, something else in Chinese and she turns to me and says, ""oh we have a $10 minimum tipping policy"". I thought, 'What the fuck!? You have got to be fucking kidding me.' So I just looked to my hubs and told him, whatever,  just give it to them so we can go.

Now thinking back, I shouldn't have given them anything!  Not only did you get my service wrong, I ask for back massage not foot spa, you didn't spend my whole 75 minutes on me, In fact you cut our time short, and now that I'm even giving you something.... you are telling me, how much I HAVE TO TIP YOU!!  I was really looking forward to this massage too! Therefore, they get this long 1 star review because I've never been soooo disappointed in a massage place ever.",1

1292,"This update is for the DAYCLUB. My friend and I came here on a weekday. We got in free and it was pretty quiet, but the music was good and there were plenty of places to lay out. A server explained that since it was slow, we could sit anywhere we wanted except in the cabanas. She was also very careful to explain that if they filled up and people came in who wanted to pay for the seats and daybeds, they'd have to start bumping people. No problem and props for being upfront about it. We took over a daybed that was right at the edge of the water. The pool area is a bit on the small side, but not nearly as small as Tao and Azure. The music was good. Drinks were about what we expected to pay. The server was really awesome. We only left because we got hungry and since it started getting cloudy, we got a little cold. If you want to get a lot of sun, I suggest staying on the side that you walk in from; the other side gets shaded by the building a lot (which is good if you're looking for shade). We'll definitely be back!",5
1294,Worst place ever!! Took the food forever !! Waitress instead of being apologetic she was rude and very unfriendly !!

1296,"We had a great experience. It was exactly what my wife and I were looking for. Some good Mexican food and a margarita after shopping at the outlets in Anthem. We weren't looking for a major gourmet affair, just somewhere to stop on the ride back and we were pleasantly surprised. The service was awesome and it seemed very family oriented. I had the carne asada and it was really flavorful. My wife had the delux burrito and she enjoyed it as well. Thanks!",5
1298,"Plenty of options. $25 is a bit much for a no-service buffet. And they will want tip, but honestly that's par for the course. Lots of options, and they have gelato. It's probably the best buffet in town, worth the Lyft ride from the Golden Nugget--that buffet has nothing over Rio. 

Be careful, if you have more than 2 plates, and you'll want to, you might end up looking like everyone that's at the buffet. Watch yourself!",5

They know their stuff and can recommend you new things to try based on what you've already had. I walked in today, and it had been awhile since I've been in. The man at the counter immediately remembered me and my preference for hard root beer. They had just received a large shipment of a limited run of my favorite line, and at bottom dollar prices! It really showed the attention to detail and care that goes into operating this establishment. I'll definitely be returning. Check the place out! I highly recommend it.",5

1309,"Ordered a 48 piece veggie set, and a 8 piece cucumber roll. What I received was a 48 piece set without the cucumber roll I paid for. After being on the phone with them for 15 minutes of them arguing it, saying their menu was wrong. The 48 piece set is actually a 40 piece set and the cucumber rolls i ordered are in there, that's why there are 48 pieces. Would not refund my money for the extra set I didn't receive, didn't care nor understand the issue, and said it was my fault. Ridiculous. After fighting forever with them, they finally gave me the cucumber roll I paid for.... except it wasn't cucumber rolls at all. It was rice unravelled with cucumber pieces all over the place. I'm sure the chef obviously saw that the pieces weren't rolled!??!  I'm not even talking a bit of spillage here, i'm saying all 8 rolls weren't rolls at all. It was a container of rice and cucumber.

1318,"This place usually isn't one of my go to sandwich spots, but I was craving one of their smoothies so I decided I would give it another try since their food isn't too bad either. 

I came in around 2:30 after my shift at work and decided to get the turkey artichoke sandwich that I've had before that I enjoyed very much. I ordered it with no mayo, onions or the pickle on the side due to my strong dislike for them. 

I waited patiently while they made my sandwich and while I was in no rush I sipped on the delicious pink pi√±a colada smoothie on this hot summer day. I noticed some other customers that were in my view walked up behind the counter because the guy apparently wanted more tea and there weren't any filled up by the beverage station. The guy who might have been a manager (since he was wearing a headset) seemed very annoyed that they did that. I agree it was rude to walk back there without asking, but what does he expect when the teas for the customers weren't filled at the beverage station? The man responded to him just saying it'll take 15 minutes to make more. No apologies were given to the man in need of some more tea. 

The girl who originally took my order brought me my sandwich and I politely thanked her and got up and checked my sandwich just due to past experiences to make sure everything looked right before I left the place. Unfortunately, the pickle was still in there so I immediately threw it in the nearest trash can and also checked my sandwich to make sure the pesto butter was on there because they've left it off multiple times before. 

I went to the front and asked the cashier just to confirm that it does come with pesto and she didn't seem too sure so she asked the same man who was wearing the headset and he stated that it's a pesto butter and I said that I was aware because I've gotten it before and it didn't look like it was on there. Instead of just apologizing and giving me an extra side and letting me on my way the man asked the baker or the girl who was making the sandwiches in the back if she put it on there and she yelled back in an angry tone ""YES!"" And the guy looked back at me and said, "" She said she put it on there."" I just looked at both of them very confused because I was so surprised of how they handled this. 

Just to be clear, I was not upset until I received the worst customer service I could've possibly gotten. I wasn't expecting anything, but just an extra side of the pesto butter, but they just made me feel like I was a burden to them even though no one was in line behind me so I wasn't preventing them from helping someone else. 

I work in the food industry and they clearly could've known that since I was wearing my work uniform, and I deal with people's requests all day long, and since this was something so minor and how they dealt with this it made me never want to come here again. This isn't the first time the employees have showed poor customer service, but this is definitely the worst by far. 

One star for the smoothie, but I'd rather take my business elsewhere next time for better customer service.",1
1319,After a few trips to Riga Tony's for lunch I am a fan... They have a great weekly lunch special each day for $6.95 each dish comes with a really good Antipasta salad with a really good dressing.

Before visiting the Quiet Storm I didn't realize that their entire menu was vegetarian, but that shouldn't be much of a problem even for fans of meat. I ordered the ""Maelstrom"" which is a what I would call a Mediterranean Quesadilla. The flavor was subtle, but delicious. There were plenty of menu options and it looks like this restaurant is really doing it's part to support the local community. The only complaint I would have was that the temperature also got a bit cold as we were sitting by the door... and it was winter. Finally, remember to bring enough cash to cover the bill as that's the only way to pay. I was not disappointed by the Quiet Storm and will definitely be getting back to this place next time I'm in Pittsburgh.",5

1330,"The service is above expectations - on time, courteous, knowledgeable, flexible and accommodating.  I've also referred this company to friends and business connections and have continuously been given commendations for such a classy connection. The owner takes personal responsibility for the maintenance and operation of the fleet, which is in excellent condition. This is a great deal for anyone who wants to impress without the hassle of owning this quality yourself.",5
1332,"Terrible service. Will never come here again. There was no one in the drive thru. Nor was there anyone in the dinning area. Yet the gal at the drive thru that looked like a clown had us waiting for almost a good 7 mins till she finally took our order. 
For one look more presentable at work. She look she was stuck in October season.",1
1333,"Service was terrible.  Our waitress barely paid any attention to us. By the time it took us to get our appetizer, there was a table that had come and gone.  My friend had to get up and talk to a manager just to get some service.",1

He did a clean job and fixed both of my AC units which now run ice cold. I have zero complaints and I won't use anyone else period.",5
1341,I visited this restaurants a couple of weeks ago on a Sunday. I ordered a breakfast burrito and was GREATLY disappointed. it looked like it had been slopped together. The scrambled egg was overly raw and it was topped off with a tomato sauce that tasted like pizza topping tomato sauce. It was accompanied by rice and beans: the rice was cold and the beans were extremely dry (cracked beans). I was unable to finish my meal and later that evening had a huge stomach ache. It was a huge gastronomical mistake. I don't recommend this restaurant under ANY conditions.,1
1344,"I'd love to leave a good review based on my expectations; however, I never even got my house cleaned. I put in a request through Yelp for a quote & was upfront from the beginning that I have cats. I was told to go to the website to secure the estimate and was even given a code for $20 off which was really appreciated.  I got the quote, booked the appointment for first thing Monday morning (yay!) and then had a question about how they'd charge my card... I guess I entered my card info wrong so it was showing declined, which was no big deal. Then today, 24 hours before I'm expecting them to come, I get a message that the only teams he has available for the next several weeks are highly allergic to cats. I mean, I get that people can be allergic to cats but 1) when I initially contacted this company he should have said that and 2) if you're going to a run a business where your teams of employees have to go into homes, it is very likely that some of those homes will have cats so you should either A) Make it clear on the website or B) hire people who aren't allergic. 

Now it's the day before I was supposed to have my house cleaned and I don't have anyone coming like I thought before an event.",1

She was passionate, patient, understanding and informative and fought tooth and nail to make sure that my kids and myself where taken care of. She kept me informed step by step on the progress of my case and reassured me when I was loosing courage and doubt and explained everything in a way that made sense. She is was very organized and well prepared for all our meetings and hearings and was extremely professional.

1350,"This review is for Water Chestnut which is their ramen menu offered Thursday - Saturday evenings. I've been here twice for ramen and it is so delicious! They have a build-your-own type style where you can choose the broth, type of noodle, protein and toppings. Both times I've had the Chinese sausage with garlic shoyu, soft egg, & nori and it was awesome! The sausage, while not a traditional ingredient is sweet and savory and adds a nice amount of flavor. I find the portions size to be decent, I haven't been able to finish. Their craft cocktails are also very inventive with fresh ingredients. While my husband and I were finishing our dinner the chef came out to ask how everything was, she then told us that everything is homemade including the dumpling skins. We will definitely have to come back and try some of the smaller bites next time.",5

Although that doesn't help worth a darn if your stylist doesn't pay attention to what they're doing and they give you a reversed mohawk!! Prior to getting my noggin cropped, I explained in detail as to what I wanted done, and the stylist did the complete opposite! I would strongly advise not going here if you like you hair. If you're one of those people who's into the chemo look... well then by all means make this place your new personal hang out!",1
1354,"Found the place by accident. Loved the decor, the smell and the ambience. The service was great.  I am from the east coast so to find a good Indian restaurant out in vegas was a great thing.

Outstanding service! I need two vanities replaced in my master bath and had to work around my tile guys.  They sent Chris and he was very professional.  He explained everything during every step of the process. He didn't try to add any additional expenses and was very forthcoming about want I needed and didn't need.  The tile guys were a little late in finishing their portion of the project and Chris was nice enough to stick around until they were finished.  I signed up for their preventive maintenance plan and it was well worth it.  Again, every step along the way Chris showed me exactly what he was doing and what was needed.  They were very friendly, on time, and called in advance each time to let me know their technician was on the way.  Their prices were competitive and they would match the estimates from others as well. I recommend this company without any hesitation.",5
1356,"This place has hands down the best salsas I have seen.  Our waiter was cool and didn't mind bringing a large selelction of the 15-some-odd salsas.  From mild to spicy, they were all very good.  I recommend the tomatillo green salsa (I think it is #7).

The menu is very extensive with food for both the unadventurous gringo and authentic-food lover.  Everything my party had looked tremendous, but the fajitas looked a bit underwhealming.",5

1361,"Great Barber Shop. Not much more needs saying, but I will. 

I've been a long time customer of one of the barbers there, Joe, and was happy to follow him when he moved here. Why? Well, he gives one hell of a flattop, that's why. This cut is a little tricky for some people, but not for him. It's perfect every time. I don't know about the other barbers there because I only let Joe touch my hair.

The place is tastefully decorated. It feels a little like what I imagine an old school barber shop might have been like, but more modern, of course. Everyone is friendly and you feel like they all know what they're doing. 

They offer various services and the prices are posted a board. I just usually get a cut. I do get a warm towel on the head and then a massage afterwards, which adds to the overall experience but not to the cost. It's those extras that I really like. 

At this point, I've been there a dozen times or more. I've never waited for my appoint, not once. That's awesome for those of us who are on the go and need to get in and out! Call ahead, I imagine it's a time saver. 

What can I say. Love this place and hope it's around a very very long time.",5

1363,"Fantastic atmosphere, great staff, amazing food, this place has it all and is always #1 on my recommended list of bars/restaurants to check out when friends go to Las Vegas. I love eating inside with all the decor, but sitting outside is a nice treat in Vegas since most restaurants are totally inside the casinos. I've had the burgers which are out of this world and the heirloom tomato salad with goat cheese, blue cheese and farmhouse cheese - good but I wouldn't get it again. Last time I was there, my sister and friend both enjoyed the roasted turkey panini with muenster cheese and spicy cranberry chutney on muesli bread with seeds and dried cranberries in it (they described it as Thanksgiving in a sandwich). It's definitely worth a pit stop to New York New York!",5

I was one of the first people in the store and went directly to the American Tourister luggage, which was on sale for $49.99. One woman was in front of me and grabbed all the hardside pieces. When I asked the clerk if they have more, she said no. This sale was advertising nationally, yet ONLY ONE PIECE OF LUGGAGE IN EACH STYLE WAS AVAILABLE. TOTALLY INEXCUSABLE! Fool me once, Tuesday Morning. Never again.",1

The owners are genuine new yorkers, and really good people, I just waited on them in my restaurant and you can tell character pretty quick that way.  The lunch stuff is great too, fantastic wraps.  I also absolutely love how much cream cheese they put on the bagels, I beg to differ if you feel otherwise.  What I really like is the feeling of professionalism being like a chain, with still the feel of a local deli.",5

It's so refreshing when you find a good quality place that has already become established with popularity and then you see they also provide outstanding service.",5
1375,"Horrible customer service. Ordered food, came in bar to pick it up, gave bartender my name, waited 15 mins for her to socialize with other customers, while
My food sat on the counter.. I believe her name was Jess. Not a great way to get me back here for lunch orders! Definitely better service at your wagon wheel/95 remedys",1
1376,"My husband and I had always wanted to try this place. One day last week we finally did and I must say that it was not a pleasant experience. They had just opened, it was lunch time. There was music blaring throughout, we could barely hear the server who greeted us. She was semi friendly but rushed us through when there was nobody else even behind us.  I get it they just opened however a supposed to be ""Texas""barbecue restaurant should be playing something a little more fitting to their style. Their personality should be a little more inviting. I'm not asking for Ellie Mae but sheesh they definitely have some stuff to work on. Now to address the prices and food. All ambience aside, the prices are way too high for the quality and stemware that their food is served upon. The salad I had was not fresh, anyone can open up a bag of ""salad"" toss it on a small black plastic plate sprinkle a little beans and oh I forgot to mention the whole 2 to 3 ounces of meat dabbled on top and call it a salad. Did I forget to mention they charge you $9.25 for it? Yes...yes they did. My husband had a 2 meat plate of flavorless meat. They charged $13 for that. I will say his portion size was much larger. However flavorless semi dry meat is much less to ever be desired again. Their sauce is vinegar based and has a distinct taste of plastic in the sticky overused bottles they sat in on the sticky plastic tables. My husband and I later that afternoon experienced some stomach discomfort for sure. I come from the south and y'all definitely have a thing or two to learn about hospitality, barbecue and pricing. We will not be returning and have let our friends know also they should not waste their money on this place. They can find much better value, service and food at Rudys or Dickeys!!",1
1378,I just stayed at the Cosmopolitan with my friend. The hotel was amazing but this place was the worst part of the trip. We came in and sat at the bar. No other customers were at the bar. No one acknowledged us for 5 minutes. 2 other ladies walked in sat at the bar and were immediately served water and given the happy hour menu and regular menu before us. Only then did the bartender give us the happy hour menu and not the regular menu. He did not serve us any water either. Then another couple sat to the other side of us and were immediately served water and given the regular menu and happy hour. We had wanted food and drinks but decided to just get drinks and leave since the service was so poor.,1
1379,"We finally stopped in to try this place & the service was good & the food was great! We had Tom Kha soup, Pad Thai & yellow curry. We will definitely be going back. We were surprised it wasn't packed busy when we went in... especially after we got our meal & were happy with whole experience.",5
1381,"We had never heard of Yen Sushi before some family members took us here for happy hour one evening.

Wow, what a hidden gem we were missing out on!  

We probably ordered enough food for 10 people... and the 4 of us ate it all. It was all amazing. The presentation of the food really stood out to me. The Calamari Roll (my absolute favorite) even comes with a few fried calamari on the side! What a deal! 

Inside it feels cozy and welcoming, and the staff was all extremely friendly.

I have a feeling Yen Sushi is going to become a regular place for us!",5

DEFINITELY will return to enjoy the food, service, and atmosphere.",5
1386,"One of the Best pubs I have been to in Toronto, a top place to have a beer before or after a show in the Entertainment district.  I went here after having seen a show at the Princess of Wales theatre (Book of Mormon for those interested) with a large group of people and they had no problem finding a place for us on the second level.

The place has an awesome beer selection, they advertise 50 on tap and I am sure it is close to that (although a few of them were out).  The beers are mostly European ones, with only a couple of Ontario microbrews but the options they have are great, and none of them are Molson or Labatt swill which earns brownie points in my book!  Our waitress was really friendly and helpful and she knew a lot about the beers and was able to offer good suggestions.   

There were no problems on the food side either, I had mussels and spicy sausage which were really tasty while everyone else had something they enjoyed as well.  Be warned the steak sandwich is just a steak on a bun as opposed to the traditional steak strips which can be a bit tricky for people with small mouths.  Next time I am in Toronto and if I find myself in the entertainment district again I would definitely come back here.",5
1388,Bill was awesome all around! Highly competitive pricing and he was not only very thorough but also quick!! He came on time and changed out three doors with two locks each!!

Simone is talented in her line of work and she delivers excellent customer service.  We would rate our overall experience with Simone beyond the 5 stars if Yelp allowed it.

1404,"Thank goodness I don't have a car anymore and don't have to deal with these clowns.

Back when I moved into PGH, I did have a car, and obtained the residential permit necessary to park in my neighborhood (N. Oakland).  Go figure, when I went to the office to do so, the meter I first tried to park at was broken, and wouldn't accept any of my quarters.  (This is back in the day when the old meters still existed.)  I should have recognized this as a metaphor for PPA's dysfunctionality.  As it were, I just reported it to them.

As anyone who's ever been to N. Oakland knows, parking there is a real PITA, and the street that my apt. bldg.'s on doesn't even have parking.  One day about two weeks later, after parking in one of my normal spots, I went to my car only to see a ticket on the windshield.  ""What the heck?"" I thought, since I had my residential permit prominently displayed.  Turns out I was parked within twenty feet of a crosswalk.  I wasn't aware this rule even existed, but apparently, it does.  Way to welcome me to the neighborhood, PGH!

Since I was new to town and I'd heard that PGH parking court is a joke, I decided to contest the ticket.  It took me three calls to even get someone to answer the phone to sign up for a court date, since you couldn't schedule one yourself through their website.  I scheduled my hearing for an evening session about a month later.

Before I was ever able to go to court, a flood happened and totaled my car, making me even angrier about the situation.  I went to court with the plan of asking for leniency, given that I was new to town and newly carless.  When it was my turn, I took one look at the judge (a portly and stern-looking elderly woman) and knew I wasn't going to get off.  I didn't even get to finish my sob story before she cut me off.  ""It isn't our fault you didn't know the rules and that your car's wrecked,"" she said.  Good thing I had enough cash on me to pay the fine, since I don't think they even took credit cards.

Don't believe the stories about PGH parking court judges taking pity on you because you took time out of your day to show up and contest a ticket, regardless of the reason for it.  That court is a kangaroo court and they're out to do one thing--make money.  Be aware of the more obscure laws, which include not only parking too close to crosswalks, but also head-in parking only.  Check the parking signs carefully, feed the meters, and observe the time limits, and hopefully, you won't have the misfortune of dealing with these idiots.  You've been warned.

I won't even get into the exorbitance of their rates downtown and in Oakland...  Their slogan, ""The Value Parking Network,"" is laughable and downright disingenuous.",1
1405,"I was just charged $55 for a men's buzz cut after waiting for 45 minutes. The last appointment I had here was canceled because I was 15 minutes late. I needed a haircut for a trip and thought I would give MCN another chance. What a mistake. They must already have enough clients that they surely don't need new clients, because I cannot remember the last time I was treated so shabbily by a business. Maybe the airlines. If you haven't been here before, I highly recommend that you stay far away. I know I will.",1

Pumpkin whoopie pie will haunt me and I may have to have my friends figure out how to mail me a dozen.  The red velvet cupcake, which I love anything red velvet, was very good.  I had the chicken breakfast burrito - very good, but what made it was the salsa - excellent.",5
1408,"The rating should be TEN PLUS!

I have suffered from sleep apnea for years and have unsuccessfully tried the CPAP option - CANNOT SLEEP with the CPAP.  I visited the Chandler ""Core Sleep Solutions"" and in TWO short weeks Core Sleep Solutions basically changed my life!

I had tried a few appliances advertised on TV, however, none of them worked and they were PAINFUL to use.  I later discovered some people can ruin or lose teeth trying different TV offered appliances.  The oral appliance Dr. Core prescribed is PAINLESS and simple to use.

The process leading to the appliance was also simple.  The first visit consisted of x-rays and verbal discovery of my overall health.  The following visit consisted of a home sleep study confirming my sleep apnea and nightly oxygen depletion.  A succeeding visit entailed taking a molding image of my teeth.  Ultimately, I was issued the oral appliance.  Very simple steps.

The staff informed me of what to expect (increase and tapering off of dreams) and encouraged me to contact them if I experienced problems or side effects.  All questions were answered and I left their office looking forward to my first decent sleep in years!

The first night I had THIRTY dreams (it was like the Dream Flood Gates had opened).  The dreams subsided to a comfortable THREE a night by the end of the first two weeks.

I immediately noticed chest pains (from my over-beating heart) disappeared.  Not only was I sleeping through the night without choking, I felt RESTED and GREAT.  

Additionally, I discovered an increase in energy (enough to get me started on a walking exercise routine to lose weight).  Now I have energy to burn!

Dr. Gary Core and his Awesome Staff have literally SAVED MY LIFE!  It's WONDERFUL to sleep and wakeup refreshed.  2015 started with the unexpected loss of a family member and is ending with my life being restored!  

In a nutshell, ""Thank You, Dr. Core"" for my 2015 Christmas Gift""!

If you have Sleep Apnea, PLEASE do yourself a favor and setup an appointment with Dr. Core at Core Sleep Solutions.  Sleep Apnea is nothing to play with... it can be deadly.",5
1411,"This review is solely for their dumplings, and I am OBSESSED with them. Their pork dumplings are my favorite, and I usually get them pan fried. Very tasty and juicy (almost reminds me the little soup dumplings aka xiao long bao). They make their dumplings freshly by hand, and although they only have three options, you can ask them if they could provide something else for you. I haven't done this personally just because I already know I want their pork dumplings. I do order something else to try alongside my dumplings just so I'm not too biased. 

I have tried three of their fruit smoothies, and you can tell that they actually are drinks made from actual fruit. None of that powder stuff. 

Staff members are attentive and give amazing service..which is rare at a chinese restaurant. The boss already recognized me my second visit, so their dumplings + the recognition makes me keep coming here.",5
1412,"I discovered So We Meat Again from a groupon, and am very happy I did! 

Although I'm not much of a sausage lover, the bacon they smoke is pork PERFECTION! 

When I returned to purchase more bacon, I tried a sandwich, and it was delish, as well! It gets a little busy around lunch time, and there aren't many tables, but the sandwiches are really good! 

However, if you're a bacon lover, you must go and get some of their maple-smoked bacon...your kitchen will smell like maple bacon heaven, and the flavor of that bacon is absolutely pigglicious!!",5

1416,"I ordered lunch special hot pot with lamb, fish, cuttlefish balls, tofu, enoki mushrooms, napa cabbage and rice noodles. Was $10.99, and waitress was great about getting more water as I got the Sichuan broth and I was thirsty. This is essentially my favorite ingredients between when I visit my family and when I have visited Las Vegas and had hot pot there. Good portions, and definitely enough to be full.

I wanted to check if it was to my liking before I brought my fianc√© along as he has not had hot pot before, and I think next time I will get the all you can eat option if I am hungrier or do 2 lunch specials if I am bringing my fianc√©.

They also have sushi which I plan to try out at a later visit.",5

I must preface: I suggest ordering multiple things and sharing, therefore you get to taste more menu options!

CORN SOUP: wow! The flavors literally transform in your mouth from sweet roasted corn to zesty spice. 

Goat cheese fondido: A MUST TRY!!! Literally the best thing I've ever eaten. Burnt cheese on top, and soft gooey cheese on the inside. If this doesn't sound appealing to you, you need to reevaluate your life priorities. 

Spicy chicken hash: my personal least favorite of what we got, but still incredible and flavorful. The egg was poached to absolute perfection. 

Bread basket: really good but DO NOT FILL UP ON THIS.",5

Going into the basement space is always such a treat. They have a huge selection of supplies for the craft geek to have a real field day.

1432,"I don't think I'll ever be as satisfied and happy with a hotel as we were with this one..

This was the ABSOLUTE BEST hotel we've ever experienced. The whole stay was amazing. I loved everything about our room and the size of it, the view and the bathroom was impeccable. The bathtub was huge, also inside the shower, a very modern feel.
The view is absolutely breathtaking. Since it's one of the only hotels off of the strip, the view of the strip is amazing. That would be the only inconvenience of the whole hotel, many taxi rides. You can walk to the strip, but it's a looong walk. It's better to go across the street to The Rio and take the shuttle from there to Harrah's, that's your best shot. Since there's three hotels that make up the Palms, you'll never really be bored there. The Palms Place is where you should stay (price-wise) for your room, the Palms Casino is just a short walkway from there. The actual casino floor of the Palms isn't extremely impressive, it's smaller than I expected, but of course, it gets the job done for gambling. The restaurants in the Palms are top-notch. N9NE Steakhouse was to-die-for. Best steak I've ever had. They have a cafeteria in the Palms Casino and it comes in handy when you're on your way back to your room for a late night snack. The pizza place in that section of the casino is pretty impressive. We ordered a pizza around 2 in the morning and took it back to our room.
The lovely cleaning room attendants cleaned our room everyday to the extreme, but not so much that I felt uncomfortable with them touching all of our things. And they left presents for us everyday. chocolates, robes, flowers. They really were amazing. 
You can't use your balcony anymore, because you can't use any balcony anymore in Vegas, which is upsetting now, because that would have been beautiful to sit out on at night, but still the view was just as beautiful from the door. 

I really was surprised by all of the bad reviews I read on them before writing this, I really don't even have a complaint and it just seems odd that so many people had such a drastically different experience than us. I can only go off of our experience, which was amazing. it's going to be hard for another hotel to live up to my standards of this one from here on out..that's for sure.",5

1436,"My boyfriend and his family are huge Los Angeles Kings Hockey fans. Every year The Kings play a preseason game in Las Vegas, and it always falls on my Birthday weekend.  This year mom wanted to join us so she could celebrate my birthday weekend with me.  To celebrate my Birthday she took me and my boyfriend out to dinner at Roy's at 7:30p on September 28, 2012.  I had an awesome Birthday experience!

We were lead to our table and handed customized Birthday Menus announcing MY Birthday!!!  This customized approach really adds to the reason's of why I'm glad I chose Roy's as my Birthday dinner place.  Our waiter Thomas, made for a very welcoming experience, his personality makes you feel as if you are right at home. He was very attentive and informative and was able to accurately describe all the dishes we asked about and make them seem tantalizing.  He also peaked our interest with some of the specials he described.  Throughout the meal we never had to want for anything as he was always available to serve us.

We decided we could order a few plates and share a bit as well.

To start -The Lobster California Roll:  I order variations of this roll at many places I frequent and Roy's did not disappoint.  Also the portion was a very good amount so that we were all able to share and there was still a piece or two left.

My Mom - Shellfish Sampler: The lobster tail was huge and very meaty.  It melted in your mouth.  The scallops we so tasty and also huge. The crab cake recipe was delicious.  The curry sauce drizzled over the meal was flavorful and just the right amount of spicy/smokey taste. They should really bottle and sell that stuff. Normally I don't go for alot of carbs but I couldn't stop eating the Macadamia Nut Pesto Risotto from her plate.  
Strawberry Daiquiri - How could you go wrong with this?  and Roy's did not disappoint. 

Me - Lilikoi Pear Salad: I love their Candied Macadamia Nuts! I was eating a salad but it definitely felt like I was cheating. There was plenty of Gouda cheese in the salad, unlike some restaurants who want to skimp on the expensive cheese.  The Asian Pears went great with the salad and the dressing balanced it all out.
DeLoach Pinot Noir from California - I loved this wine.  It was rich and had a slightly sweet red cherry or blackberry hint to it.

My Bf - Pan Seared Trout.  Again, the portion of the meat was more than expected. This fish was flaky and smooth.  The sauces and side dish pairings were detectible.
The Jalepeno Margarita - We are Tequila drinkers and our favorite mixed drink would probably be the margarita.  This is why this menu item piqued our interest.  This is definitely not your normal margarita but if you are in the mood to try something different it is one that I would recommend.

The Chocolate Molten Cake was very decadent.  The only problem was that I was stuffed! As the meal went on and on I was getting so full, but yet all the food was so delicious that I couldn't stop taking small bites of everything.  By the time the Chocolate Molten Cake arrived I could only squeeze in 3 or 4 bites.  Even as full as I was, it was the Best Chocolate Molten cake I have EVER had!  It was just crispy enough on the outside with a pool of creamy chocolate inside of light and fluffy cake.  So rich, but still edible. 

I would definitely recommend Roy's for any occasion.  Friends in town, Birthday, Anniversary, or just looking for some place to eat where you know you will get detectible food of good portions, no matter what you order, exceptional service and attentive staff plus a lovely ambiance.",5
1438,"This fine dining restaurant has a nice romantic atmosphere, but the five star food and service are the star of the show!   One of the very best restaurants in Scottsdale.   Plan to make your reservations far in advance.   The chef is brilliant with the flavors and menu inspiration!",5

1454,"This place is Guuuuuud. What can I say,  the salmon sashimi is incredible, a must have when you visit,  the deep fried Brie cheese is also good, like,  super good. The staff is super friendly and greet you on your way and on your way out,  it's hard not to smile and have fun when you're visiting Guu. Great deal on pints,  you can get a massive pint of Sapporo for a reasonable price. Great spot for a inexpensive lunch with massive portions. The rice bowls and ramen bowls are massive,  a great lunch deal that can't be beat in this area. Fresh ingredients and Japanese comfort food done right. If you're in the area and in a jam then go to Guu,  you won't regret it. 

Only downside is the long wait times,  but you can't blame them for that,  their popularity in justified. Just look at the picture of my lunch, cost me 8 bucks! 

I'll be coming back many many times,  especially on Halloween when they have LIVE PERFORMANCES AND EVENTS that happen in the bar and are interactive with everyone,  including the staff, that are geared up in sweet costumes. 

It's Guuuuuud times.",5
1455,"Dr. Henderson and his staff are all amazing. I brought in my beagle because we suspected she had bladder cancer but fortunately she didn't. Dr. Henderson is truly concerned about the animals under his care and I can tell that his staff is too. I had a family member recommend this vet to me because she has a lot of cats, and she's been to most vets in Vegas and Dr. Henderson is undoubtedly the very best. I recommend him to anyone with a cat or dog, and I can't sing his praises well enough.
 
EDIT: I posted this review about a year ago. Jenny turned out to have cancer lower in her urinary tract which was extremely hard to detect, and impossible to treat without causing her huge amounts of pain. The staff and Dr. Henderson were the absolute best, I've taken animals to vets in the past and Dr. Henderson and the staff were without question the nicest and most caring + competent veterinary people I've ever seen. When I decide to get another dog in the future and if they need to visit a vet, I will definitely choose Dr. Henderson and his staff!",5

1458,"I originally built my 2014 Camero SS 1LE online and received a call the following day from Gina to offer assistance. I received multiple emails and calls from the various dealers in Vegas, but Gina was very professional and helpful so I set up an appointment to visit Henderson Chevrolet. Prior to my appointment I received a call from Joe Gallagher to talk about the very specific Camero I was looking for. Joe quickly located a couple cars that met my specifications and reached out to those dealers to inquire about there availability. On the day of my appointment I received another call from Gina just to confirm my visit. When I arrived Joe was ready to review the car and finance options. We located my Camero in California and Joe worked with that dealer and his GM to secure it for me. Joe and the finance team also assisted in capturing a much better finance rate than my bank of 15 years could provide. Negotiations were very professional and pressure free and I'm very pleased with the value of my trade-in and the finial purchase price.
 On delivery day I arrived and was blown away by my choice. The car looked amazing and exceeded my expectations. Alejanda assisted in reviewing all the aspects of my new car. She was very helpful and knowledgeable. As I mentioned I had several dealers to choose from in the Vegas area including one a block from my work. I couldn't be more pleased with my choice to drive to Henderson Chevrolet. The entire team made the experience first class. I will have know problem recommending Henderson Chevy to anyone in the market for a new car.

I decided to list the home with them and they really came through.  The transaction had some tough spots along the way but everyone on the team kept me up to date and informed about what my options were and what was next.

1467,"This was by far the worst hotel I have stayed in on the Strip, and definitely not the cheapest.  The lady at the registration desk was not friendly at all.  We got into our room and were immediately not impressed.  The room was very dark.  There was a small desk light and one end table lamp.  There was also a large lamp in the corner, but it was not plugged in for some reason.  It did work though, once we found the problem.  There was also some running lights around the room that did not work at all.  There was a missing drawer and missing doors in the dresser.  There was only one single accessible outlet, which we discovered later also didn't work.  We complained about the light at the front desk within an hour after checking in.  The desk clerk offered to move our room, but insinuated that it wouldn't get any better.  He did supposedly place a work order for the lights, although we never saw or heard from anybody and they were never fixed.  After showering the next day, I discovered there was no hair dryer in the room.  They brought me one the next day, and it did not work.  After spending three nights in the hotel, I was finally able to actually dry my hair!  We were staying at PH on New Year's Eve, and our friends that were travelling with us received information in their rooms about the street closing, but that was not provided to us.  We also learned from visiting other rooms, that our room was also missing an end table lamp.  Some other minor details, that I'm sure bothered me more based on our terrible experience...the furniture was haphazardly placed blocking access to the window, our bed was not made on the last day, there were two closets but only one had hangars.  The location is good, but I definitely recommend staying elsewhere.  There are plenty of options on the Strip, many priced more reasonably than PH.",1

They tried to charge me $11.99 so we showed them they said they forgot to take the old price off . Than we told them because it was marked that price they had to honor it .They refused to honor the price  .I had other items I left and didn't purchase any. They also made it sound like it would be hard to return any thing that's considered a dog treat if your dog doesn't like it. I wasn't purchasing cheap dog treats .I was purchasing organic top quality items. I left there and went to the other pet club store further down on bell they where much nicer more helpful . I do not recommend this store at all.,1
1477,"Why hello beautiful.  How's it feel to take the ""favorite hotel"" title away from Aria?

Just from passing through Cosmo on my previous trips to Vegas, I've been pretty fond of the place.  Their location is fantastic (between the Bellagio and Aria/City Center, and across the street from PH and Paris), and the design and d√©cor are pretty awesome (particularly the ""changing art"" in the elevators and lobby).  And while they aren't as large as other hotels on the strip, they have a ton to offer - the latest hot spot in Vegas (Marquee), restaurants galore (Holsteins!), a three level bar (The Chandelier), late night eats (Secret Pizza), shops (Kid Robot!) and my favorite buffet (Wicked Spoon!).  Despite all that though, it was my stay at Cosmo that impressed me the most.

While my friends and I have always wanted to try out the Cosmopolitan, their room rates have always pushed us towards cheaper alternatives.  As fate would have it though, a couple of my friends were able to find a great deal online for the weekend we were going - only $140 a night!  However, with suites going for just $20 more a night, I decided to upgrade myself.  Yes, you read that right - a suite just for myself...and it was the BEST.  DECISION.  EVER.  The suite was ridiculously nice - king size bed (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=q5V5Gp8j2gKI67Tsn1CU5w), separate ""living room"" area (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=3LtdG6s3yKaRruPsy1sqbA), kitchenette (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=eUnijzgD54vUz7BhZANnJw), walkout balcony (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=3n1FgIqv2yDFrDpYLob72w), two flat screen TV's, separate tub and shower (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=svlV_W_Z81nArE3oubllCg), dual sinks(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5LNZ67Yw9RD6nf4_UhXOjw?select=5lxiFXsbbJxtzeZ63l9a0w)...way more than I actually need from a hotel room.  And it was awesome! 

Even though my stay was great, their service made it that much better - every worker I talked to (front desk, maids, dealers, pit bosses, Beck and Call guys, bell hops) was super nice and friendly.  Cosmo offers so much to love and so little to dislike, I could only come up with one bad thing about them - now that I've spoiled myself with one of their suites, I don't know how I'm going to be able to go back to a regular room.

Crud.

**Quick notes:
- On Friday nights, guys staying at Cosmo can get into Marquee free until 11:00pm, provided they have a 1:1 ratio.
- There are two towers - East is closer to the main part of the casino while West is closer to the front desk/Wicked Spoon.  My friend had the same suite as I did in the East Tower, but his room seemed smaller.  Not sure if that's the case for every room or not though.",5

I decided to give this practice another chance so I called to schedule an appointment and I was denied services because I posted a YELP review of my experience at this office. I was told that they will only schedule me an appointment if I took down my Yelp post. Who is running this facility? Obviously, a manager that does not know how to conduct proper customer service. Instead of starting over and maybe speaking with me at my appointment about our misunderstanding, this manager ordered her staff to deny me services and tried to force me to take down my review. It is apparent that they didn't take any advise from my post 6 months ago when I suggested a re-training course on customer service. I refused to take down my review because it was my opinion of this facility based on the way I was being treated. Hopefully this reaches the CEO of the facility so he or she can see how their employees are treating customers. They are the face a reflection of this company, I would hope they take to this review and get it together.

I had a question regarding a medication refill. I was told that I would need to come in at my next appointment., which I understood.

1508,"We absolutely love Pusadee's!! It is tied with Nicky's Thai Kitchen as our favorite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. It breaks our hearts when they close for the winter, but we know that come spring we will be enjoying their delicious food once again! 

We have eaten in and done takeout here many times, so this review is much overdue.  Takeout service is always quick and efficient. We are usually enjoying our meals within 30 minutes after calling and picking up (compare this to Thai Place in Aspinwall, which always gave us a 45 minute wait due to being ""busy"" but never had anyone eating in the restaurant when we arrived...). 

The indoor space is sparse but functional. There are simple tables and chairs, and not much decorations on the walls. Their outdoor space is gorgeous and generally what people go for when eating here. The garden is lovely and relaxing, with lights strung up around the beams and simple plants making the space inviting and relaxing. We attempted to eat outside yesterday, but gave way to the heat and ended up indoors. Someday soon we will enjoy our bottle of wine in the garden!

We typically order two different dishes and share. We start out with the fresh garden rolls, which are delicious. It is a small order, but the perfect start to a meal. The vinegar sauce is light and refreshing, but I do prefer the peanut sauce that Nicky's offers with their spring rolls. We have had the red, green, and pumpkin curries, and our favorite is the green. The sauce is more complex than the pumpkin, even though we love the pumpkin chunks! There are numerous fresh vegetables in each that soak up the wonderful sauce. We also share an order of brown rice, which is worth the extra cost. I recently had Thai in NYC, and I have to say that I loved the curry at Pusadee's much better! Their blend of spices and coconut milk is simply perfect. 

Pusadee's and Nicky's will continue to be our favorite Thai places here! I am so glad that Pittsburgh has more and more options for great Thai dining.",5

[Kicks the messenger down the well] 

There's no well to get kicked into, but they have a huge ice cream shaped waste receptacle outside. Be kind. Don't litter. There also aren't 300 robust, wickedly ripped men ready to fight for me here... sigh.

But boy, do they make up for it...

Temptation. Temptation. Temptation. Sweets upon sweets. Lord knows I have a soft spot for chocolates... in any way, shape, or form.

Most gelato/ice cream places let you sample a flavor or two before committing, and Leonidas is no different. I settled on some chocolate gelato. Oh, it was perfect for that warm spring Sunday.

I also grabbed a box of dark chocolate truffles to go. I'm very proud of myself for not devouring them upon sight. Savor the goodness, my friends. Savor it. Or come back again! =D

Btw, the ladies here are super sweet! Like the chocolates. They would never kick me into a bottomless pit.",5
1511,"SO OVER PRICED!!!! I'm from San Diego and I was on a trip to visit my cousins in AZ for a couple days with my husband and 5 year old son. We went with my cousins to wet n wild, we paid around 120$ for the tickets and IT WAS NOT WORTH IT AT ALL. The place was so dirty, i saw a kid throwing up in one of the pools and people kept playing in the water anyway, i mean shouldnt it be cleaned or something before letting people in again?!!! Made me so sick! Then i wanted an iced coffee or something to drink so i go to this cafe or whatever it is, the moment i walk in i was literally gonna throw up! Got sick like so sick because of the smell, so gross, idk if they're frying food with old oil or if its the smell of the place itself but i just couldnt stay there at all, trash cans were over filled and trash was on the floor, yikes!My kid got bored an hour later so we just left. I wouldnt go back to this dirty overpriced water park ever!",1
1512,Best pizza place in Vegas drove all the way from Los Angeles. It's cheap and hot and crispy. The owner is very friendly and very helpful.,5
1514,"Scenery: It's very modern inside. The seats and tables are all black. It almost looks like it could be a club. It's simply but yet nice. 
 
Food: The food was really really great. I came here with my friend and I was actually shocked at how good the food was. The wings are not the tiny size that you get everywhere else. It's a good helping. The French fries taste so fresh and the cut is great! I even tried some of my friends nachos and the cheese wasn't the cheap nasty cheese I've had at some places. It's not to thin or thick. It taste like yummy melty deliciousness. Don't get me started on dessert. Banana Foster? Just try it. If you like cheesecake, bananas, and ice cream...Banana Foster. 

The late night guy had a really great personality and was really attentive and awake! (We came in around 3am) 

Overall: It's a great place. Definitely my go-to late night bite place.",5
1515,"Fellow consumers run don't walk from this CVS Pharmacy...

On 9/18/2016, I visited the CVS Pharmacy located at 8116 S. Las Vegas Blvd., Las Vegas, Nevada to use my 30% and 20% coupons.

Unfortunately the 30% and 20% coupons were not applied to the cologne I purchased. According to your Store Manager, Azucena (Suzy) the cologne was a buy one get one 50% off and the coupon doesn't apply to sale items. I advised the store manager, Azucena the product was not marked as a sale item and she rudely replied we're not expected to label every product that's on sale. Really, I'm a business owner myself and I expect my employees to do their job, it's disturbing a corporation as large as CVS wouldn't require the same from its staff, especially a member of their management team. Furthermore, if the proper sale signage was posted, they only had one in stock so they would be unable to honor the sale.

To add insult to injury when I requested the phone number from Azucena she threw the pin on the counter. Of course, I brought this to her attention and was abruptly dismissed. I have been a frequent customer at CVS Pharmacy's across the United States and have never been treated with such disrespect and disdain.

CVS Pharmacy should honor the coupons they send to their customers if the items are not marked properly by staff. Additionally, I suspect discrimination is a factor in this case.

SHAME ON CVS PHARMACY!",1
1517,"AWFUL is an understatement. I have had issues with my brakes since having this shop work on them just over a year ago - only less than 5000 miles ago. I approached manager Rich Gerber at the counter with my receipt from my last service there, feeling that the work may have not been done properly causing the issue. Mr. Gerber took my receipt and then had people look at the vehicle, explaining that he would look it over, then come back to ""tell you what the cost will be."" I found this odd to begin with - if this was not good work there should be no cost. When he returned to tell me what was up he began with, ""Our labor is only guaranteed for 90 days,"" and proceeded to explain that somehow the exact same issue i had them fix less than 5000 miles ago had mysteriously occurred again. As he explained the issue he continued to revert to, ""our labor is only guaranteed for 90 days."" In addition to the same issue recurring, there were new issues with other brakes that they either failed to notice on the first trip or could've been exacerbated by their failure to fix the first issue correctly the first time. I got stuck paying $1000+, no discount on labor, not even an apology. One of the other workers there confided in me that they knew i had to correct the same issue twice and shouldn't have, and that he understood my frustration and anger. HE ADMITTED IT! I am pursuing legal action and will be contacting the Better Business Bureau as well. If you care about service and don't like being taken advantage of, avoid this place.",1

1526,"Horrible customer service. We went to the drive thru and heard laughs before we even said anything. I ordered two croissants with butter and got barely any butter on my crossaints. I have never gotten that little bit of butter on a crossaint at a dunkin donuts ever before. I mean they charge for the butter it's not like it's free. I complained to Karoline and she just gave me some frozen butter that I couldn't even break apart with a knife. I asked if she could just put some more of her butter that isn't frozen on the crossaint and she said she put all she had on it. I asked for a refund and was given attitude. Karoline and her coworker both started talking crap about me in front of me, even mocking me by repeating my words and laughing outloud amongst themselves. It seemed like they were high on drugs or something. I have never been to such an unprofessional dunkin donuts ever before. This place needs to fire Karoline B and her coworkers and maybe hire new management or shut down. They are hurting Dunkin Donuts reputation.",1
1529,"On our recent stay in Las Vegas, barMASA was the only place that we had dinner without prior planning. The service was a 10/10. Mike, our server was full of personality and knew his shit.  The food was very good and we were overall very happy with the experience.",5

1533,"In Italy, you can order pasta that sounds like nothing more than noodles in the simplest essence of a semblance of a sauce, and it can send you to the moon in shades of whorling flavor spirals.   However, here on King street, the fancy schmancy tortolloni-whatsis with the primavera something in a vodka-tomato gruel or whatever I had, in contrast, tasted like virtually nothing.   Eating this, was going through some empty rigamarole.   Just as with the apparent olive oil on the table that you get your bread messy with - - it all just seems done for ""effect"".    An Italian restaurant that can sometimes delight the eye - - but that's about it.   Great service though!",1
1535,"I came for the AYCE wagyu and was really impressed by the quality of the meat. Both types (Australian and US wagyu) offered on the AYCE menu were delicious, but I had a slight preference for the Australian - amazing marbling that melts in your mouth. I also tried the kagoshima Japanese a5 wagyu, which came as slightly thicker and longer slices of meat with even more beautiful marbling (extra charge $95 for 300g and $65 for 200g). I would definitely recommend it if you are okay with doubling your bill, but if you're on a budget the regular wagyu is almost as good. The veggies were also fresh and delicious - especially loved the honey sweet potato (but on the menu it said this item was limited)

As for the service, it's a really busy place with a full house and line ups. Sometimes it's a little difficult to get a server's attention but I had no issues with the speed of service. 

Overall, I had a great experience and preferred this place over gyubee. My only wish is that they had a downtown location... :)",5
1537,"This review is of the Orange Tree GOLF course and management.  This is NOT a review of the resort/hotel.

Sad to say but very true -- expect a 5 to 5 1/2 hour round. Calling for a ranger to come out and help move play along brings a tsunami storm of rude treatment from the ranger and the pro shop. It is not a golfer/customer friendly experience. It's supposed to be fun???  We payed $69/per player for slow pay (quit after 9 holes -- at times there were 3 foursomes sitting at a tee waiting) and very poor treatment.  Best advice - avoid this place. Too many great courses in the area with quality customer service to waste $$ and time here.

1538,"This year I've been trying to give positive reviews but I can't on this one. I noticed it's a trend amongst most businesses these days not to give way to the customer. If someone's walking people in stores have no problems walking directly in front of you. This is not how I was raised. Yesterday I went to this place and they couldn't break a hundred, that's understandable. First world problems no worries there. Today I go back with the appropriate amount of money, as in I'm walking up to the window the cashier darts in front of me holding a cone without an excuse me or pardon me more like a get the hell out of my way attitude. This is a new trend in service that I'm just not going to let stand without a Yelp review.",1

1549,"This place sells furniture which was formerly in hotels.  They do some refurbishing/touchup but most thing are unbelievably priced.  The deliver and setup.  WE bought stuff that was brand new because it come from a design center showroom.  Stuff moves fast here.  WE walked in and they were removing a couch from the showroom.  AS we walked around, they put another couch down in its place.  We looked at it and wife thought she might like it.  A minute later, someone else was sitting in it and deciding if they wanted it.  I grabbed the tag off of it, much to the disappointment of the other people who were trying to make their mind up.  The point is, if you see something you like, make a fast decision because the shelf life at this place is very short.
 Nice $29 lamps, $39 upholstered chairs. Great deals on complete bedroom sets.
Visit a couple of regular furniture shops first, so you can understand what prices should be, so that you can realize what great deals are going down here.",5

1553,"I no longer go to this Starbucks. It's unfortunate because it is very convenient to stop here on my way to work. There is one girl who works morning with curly hair, and if I always got her, I'd continue to go here, but every other employee I've encountered there needs to get out of customer service and quick.

On my first visit, I intended to order an iced caramel macchiato. The girl with the curly hair gave me a hot one. I couldn't remember for sure that I'd said iced, so I accepted it without comment. She thanked me, told me to have a nice day, smiled, handed me my drink and I was on my way.

On my second visit, I got the curly haired girl again. Very similar to my first visit except my drink was made like I wanted. I was happy.

On my third visit, I was in a hurry so I decided to skip the drive thru and go inside. I was actually in such a hurry that I just ordered iced coffee. The couple that had been in front of me got their drinks, so I thought I'd be on my way soon. The male half of the couple got the barista's attention to let him know the drink was made wrong. By this time, I realized I'd made a mistake by stopping because I was going to be late. So I got a female barista's attention (not the curly haired girl..she has straight, blondish gold hair) and told her that I had to go and I just didn't want them to worry about making my drink. I promise you I was in no way rude. It wasn't their fault that I was in a hurry. I was just planning on forfeiting the $3 I'd paid. The older guy behind her asked me if I'd had the iced coffee. He sounded aggravated. I said yes, so the girl made it quickly and gave it to me. She was also clearly annoyed. I thanked them thoroughly and told them that that was unexpected but appreciated. They didn't reply. 

My last visit was in the drive thru again. Again, they were very busy. I ordered an iced caramel macchiato again. The older guy was at the window this time. He handed me a hot caramel macchiato. Since I was certain I'd said iced, I nicely told him that I had ordered an iced one. He was obviously annoyed. He said ""oh"" and took it back. They then poured the hot one over ice and gave it back to me. No apology or ""thank you,"" Ora asking me if it was okay that they just poured the hot one over ice...just a ""here you go."" So that will be my last visit there. I hope the owner realizes what crap some of his employees are before everyone is like me and stops going there.",1
1554,I have used Jillians plumbing on several occasions for plumbing needs. I always get great service from the technician.,5
1555,"If I could give 0 stars I would. Here's a tip... STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE! It's not as if there aren't plenty of other hotels in the area. I had to stay here, there was a convention I had to attend for work taking place at this location. The conference will most likely be here next year too and I'll make sure to stay somewhere else. 
The food is gross and overpriced. The service was not good. As soon as we landed we attempted to locate the ""free shuttle"" that they advertise for bringing guests from the airport to the hotel. When we couldn't locate it we called the hotel and they told us that the shuttle had to be reserved 24 hours in advance and it was full for the day. He was incredibly rude and in hindsight he should have prepared me for the customer service standard this hotel holds.
The worst part of my stay here was the customer service (or lack thereof). The temperature was in triple digits so we decided to try the pool. There are two pools (one large one  and one smaller one that is probably for kids) and when we got there the larger pool was fairly empty. We laid by the pool for a little and then I started to climb in the pool. After a few minutes of wading around a life guard whistled at me. Apparently they were cleaning the pool and guests weren't allowed in due to the presence of chemicals. No sign, nothing stating this. I would have appreciated some type of warning before stepping into a contaminated pool apparently filled with cleaning chemicals but oh well. After I got out I noticed other guests making the same mistake and I even heard one remark, ""why isn't the pool roped off?""
So everyone starts gathering in the smaller pool. Not even 15 minutes later everyone is kicked out of that pool as well. Apparently it was also contaminated. Lovely. And once again, no warning sign, no roped off area. Again I saw many people walk into it not knowing it was contaminated. Eventually we went up to the room because it was clear we wouldn't get any time in the pool.
We decided to come back later at night to use the hot tub and relax. There is one hot tub with a sign at the entrance clearly stating, ""No children under the age of 16 allowed in hot tub area"". However, there was absolutely no one enforcing it. So the hot tub was over-run with children, splashing and swimming as if they were in the pool. We asked the life guard if there were indeed children allowed in the hot tub and he assured us they were not and then he asked them to leave. One parent became belligerent about his child not being allowed in the hot tub and the life guard had to call security. Not exactly the relaxing atmosphere one would hope for. As soon as the life guard left the hot-tub once again became filled with children. So we left. 
When I got back to the room I called the front desk to tell them I was disappointed by the events described above. She was not sympathetic and actually told me that it was my fault for not asking the staff to ask the children to leave the hot tub. When I told her that I did and it didn't help she then told me I should have called her instead. She then proceeded to tell me that there was nothing she could do about it but would I like a $15 food credit to my room? I would have much rather appreciated a caring/understanding/apologetic customer service representative and no food credit rather than receiving a measly $15 food credit and having to deal with the rude and condescending representative. 

TL;DR
Rude staff, save yourself the headache and stay somewhere else. Don't plan on using the pool even when it's 100+ degrees. This place is cheap and you get what you pay for.",1

1558,"After a night on Fremont St. at 2 AM, a bowl of oxtail soup is as good as it gets. We had a 5 minute wait at the most to get in and no complaints with the service. 

The soup was the perfect ending to a great night. The vegetables were soft, the meat  fell off the bone, and the cartilage at the ends of the bones was jelly. After I cleared some space at the top of the bowl by slurping some of the broth and removing the bones (8), I ordered another order of rice and put it all in the soup. I took my time and  spent the next 20 minutes savoring each spoonful of my oxtail/rice soup.

This will continue to be choice A if I find myself downtown late night.",5
1559,"I had to give one star because it wouldnt accept a zero.
Went through the drive through and ordered their special. Person i bought it for said the chicken wasnt cooked. Called Churches and spoke to the manager. SHE SAID SHE COULDNT DO ANYTHING FOR ME WITHOUT THE RECEIPT. It was in the package with the inedible chicken. I was wondering why it took so long so he served chicken that wasnt done. Unacceptable! !! You think im trying to get free chicken? No more of my business anymore. 
I spent a lot of money here in the past but im sure there are other establishments that will take my money and offer better service.

1566,I have been visiting The Joint now for 2 years +. I recently started going to this one on 59th Ave in Glendale. They guy's were really good but when Dr. Carol came in it started a whole new kind  of wellness for me. I got up off that table and wow! the blood was moving to parts of my body that had slow movement before and now I get up and feel like a new person. She is one of the best I have seen in my 20 years of going to Chiropractic care. When I over do and need an adjustment i go back to her and I walk out of there free of pain.

1575,"Don't see Vicki for measurements. She took care of both my mother and mother in law's measurements for  their dresses. Both came in completely too big or too small. To me it seemed to be an obvious up sell for alterations as it was mentioned 10+ times in conversation. ( I understand some dresses need alterations most the time, but these were WAY off!! ) just a tactic to make a bigger profit off of you. My mother in law was close to tears the day she went in to try on her dress. Vicki had the ""oh well"" attitude and jumped right to saying no returns or refunds. To make the situation, worse she spoke over us and was not listening to my mother in laws needs or to hear how truly disappointed she was. Horrible experience. I also had ordered 7 bridesmaids dresses that took 4 months. I would call to check status and be told I would get a phone call back..... Never happened.

1582,"The Skinny: a symphony in your mouth. 'Nuff said. (5) Service: there really isn't much service here - counter service only and they only have two small tables to eat at(N/A) Value: expensive for the size but oh so worth it (5).

Now let me preface this review: these treats are Japanese in style. In general, I find that Asian pastries tend to be a little less sweet, rich and dense. It is its own esthetic that not everyone will be a fan of. So if you're looking for a really gooey chocolate chip cookie or a slice of uber luxurious cheesecake, you'll probably be disappointed. You have been warned.

Ah - what can I say about Suzuya Pastries? 

Hidden behind a quick lube joint, you probably would miss it if you were driving too fast. Limited parking is also an issue due to the numerous shops (a nail salon, the quick lube, etc.) in such a small retail space.

But no matter. A trip to this bakery will take you less than 10 minutes. There really is no place to sit and eat because of the size of the shop (there's two small tables and maybe four chairs in the store). I'd imagine most people get the pastries to go. The selection is small so come earlier before it's all gone.

The time I went, I selected the Mont-Blanc chestnut cake, a kabocha pie and an apricot/almond pie. I did so to sample their two variety of crusts (a shortbread crust, a puff pastry crust) and their sponge. Suffice to say, I was genuinely impressed.

If you could only use one word to describe the Suzuya's pastries it would be this: symphony. They have a precision of flavors and textures that makes every note in your mouth sing. That's right - this place is the Ode to Joy of pastry perfection. It is a marriage of subtle spicing/sweetening (to enhance but not overwhelm the ingredients) and excellent technical skill.

The Mont-Blanc cake is sponge cake layered with pastry cream and chestnut puree. The sponge cake flavor is just right - not too heavy handed on vanilla. With all the pastry cream, it retained a wonderful texture despite all that moisture. Chestnut purees tend to be overly sweet but they were perfect here.

Kabocha pie - what a wonderful idea! It was a Japanese take on pumpkin pie and truly I was floored. What perfection of puff pastry crust! When it comes to pies, it's hard to find a pastry crust that is equally flaky even on the bottom. Well, lo and behold, Suzuya has it down to a science. The filling to pastry to ratio was just right as well. 

Finally, the apricot/almond pie. This was the husband's favorite pastry. A crispy shortbread crust adorned with glazed apricots and moist almond filling. So good and it was the special of the day.

If I have one criticism of this place, it is the prices. The three items I purchased added up to $12-ish. For the price, it would be nice to have a larger portion size for each of the desserts. However, that being said, I have paid way more for dessert elsewhere and received significantly less enjoyment.

Overall, for some amazing Asian pastries, this place is a 5 starred place in my books.",5

Their prices are right on par with other homemade bagel shops, and they do 14 bagels for $12.50.  I will definitely make this place my new home for fresh bagels.

Yesterday I shopped for Roof cement, supposedly in aisle 19 Bay 22, that is the lumber aisle, and I knew I would not find it there. Tried the roofing aisle, didn't find it there either. Asked an employee and he send me to the caulking aisle 2. Of course it wasn't there either.
Went to the contractor checkout and asked Joe. While I was waiting I checked the roofing aisle 17 (no number visible for the customer) again, and saw boxes high up on shelves unreachable for the customer.
Joe was very helpful getting them down for me. Seems he is the only guy there who knows what he is doing, Thumbs up for him!

The Home Depot App in general is useless, things like that happened to me before and nobody is fixing it. I have talked to several store managers before about their lack of knowledge, all they do is shrugging.",1

1591,Been shopping there since it opened.  Sadly the customer service has gone to hell.  No friendly employees anymore.  The service desk is now only open from 8:00am-8:00pm.  Heaven forbid anyone would help before or after those times.  Tried to buy a lottery ticket twice and I was blown off both times by rude staff.   If the store is open then the service desk should be open.  Fortunately there is a Fry's Market Place near my house.  Looks like they are going to get my business from now on.  EDDIE BASHA would roll over in his grave if he knew the sorry state of affairs at his store in McDowell Mountain.,1
1595,"This place is completely useless and a waste of time. you'll be better off eating at two peaks restaurant around the corner. Management is disorganized and lazy. Asked the male manager if we could offer drinks and food but he demanded that we order through our waitress. Waitress was obviously short staffed and over worked so we can't blame her.

Corporate really needs to get their stuff together and clean up this garbage excuse of a restaurant. Worst place we have been to in Vegas. 

Food was equally terrible and pathetic. Had pizza which was fine but the cheese fries were so sad. They don't even get it long enough so you get soft waffle fries. What happened? Is it really that hard to take fries from the freezer and put it in the fryer for 4 minutes. Absolutely no quality control. 

Save your money and time and go anywhere, literally anywhere else, and you will be much happier.",1
1597,"I have had the BEST service from Tonya at PRS.  She has kept in contact with me throughout the entire process. As a parent from California trying to find a place for my son and his 3 roommates in Tempe, I has afraid that the long distance communication and handling of the Lease Agreement would prove to be a complete failure. That is not the case! Tonya has been an efficient, professional who has made this arduous process a breeze. The guys move in on the 8th of August.  Will keep you posted.  If the place is as good as Tonya, PRS will be receiving more 5 star recommendations from the other moms too!",5
1599,"Oh where to begin. The alcohol drinks mmmmmuah to die for. The jerk chicken was a very generous portion and came with a side of steamed veggies and peas and rice. Best Jamaican food in Phoenix ao far for me.

Its is a bit odd walking into the building, however once you round that final corner and enter the main dining area it feels like u are tranaported to a place on the east coast due to the exposed brick and minimal decor. I loved it.

The staff was absolutely wonderful.  They were very attentive and even gave my son and nephew free cookies while we waited for our food to be prepared. 

I can't say enough good things about this place. I will definitely be back.",5

1603,"*** Buyer beware *** First of all, appointments mean nothing to this establishment.  An oil change took 1 1/2 hours PAST my scheduled appointment time to be completed. That is unacceptable!  Additionally, what should have been a $16.95 oil change, turned in to a near $90 bill.  WITHOUT consent or approval, additional work was performed on the vehicle.  Who does that?!  I get it if you see something that needs attention during the oil change process, but you most certainly should notify the owner if additional charges are to be incurred.  Phil C. was of no help.  Needless to say, I contacted the powers-to-be at Big O in the hopes they can rectify this situation and prevent it from happening to others, although, I have a feeling this is common place here.  They are very unprofessional and if I were you, I would go elsewhere!",1

Terri McConnell explained that it would drastically tighten the loose skin on my belly from having a 10 pound baby 20+ years ago. I have been self conscience about my abdominal area since and have whined about it for years. I regularly go to the gym, have had liposuction and eat right , none of that has made a difference. I was very skeptical but decided to try this revolutionary, FDA approved, new machine. OMG! I've had 3 treatments and my belly is tight, the texture is smoother and I can't believe the physical and visual difference! Finally truth be told and it works! 2 piece bathing suit for me? Heck yes!",5

I can't imagine taking my animals to another vet.",5
1616,"Went to Vine ""specifically"" based on strong Yelp reviews about ""crab cakes"".  Ordered three appetizers (including crab cakes) and shared two salads in order to get a good sample of Vine's offerings.  Salads were very good.  Crab cakes were ""mushy"", resembling animal droppings, and WAY TO SALTY to eat...left one on the plate.  Fried green tomatoes were SO OVERLY THICK they were uncooked inside.  Doubt the chef has ever eaten good ones?  Tuna appetizer was overly expensive, and had only a five very small bites of tuna.

I only bring issues such as these to the chef ""IF"" i think there is hope.  I paid the check including a generous tip for excellent waitress service and left quietly, never to return.",1
1618,"These guys did my yard and the end result was amazing!  Fast, super professional and fairly priced; I could not be happier with my yard.  They really are in a league of their own.

I've tried a lot of places in town and so far nothing beats Toci.",5
1620,"I love this bar!!  The service is top notch!! Nicole always has my favorite drink pouring as soon as she sees me. The staff is so friendly and always stops at my table or wherever I am sitting to say hi and give out hugs.  The locals that hang out here are awesome as well.  I feel comfortable bringing my friends and family or just stopping by on my own.  There is always someone to talk to with a smile.  Including the owner, Eva.  If she is around she always takes the time to say hi and she makes sure everyone is having a good time.  
I bring all my friends from out of town here and will continue to do so as long as Eva is in charge.  Not only do my friends love this place, they end up making friends with the team and the owner.  
Did I mention the wings and the veggie tray?  OMG, they are amazing.  My mom has to make frequent stops here for the hamburgers but, seriously I enjoy everything on the menu.  
They have great live music.  You can dance or just enjoy the talent.  It's always a good time!",5
1622,"Come here every year for the Super Bowl . Make you reservation in advance . Management was appalling . Refused to let out party have our requested server , and four times previously requesting prior to arrival . Upon sitting with my family a large gentleman was sitting in front of me so no big deal I move to the other end of the table. When another obnoxious gentleman was purposely standing in front of me after noticing my shift on the table . I asked management to ask them to have a seat so I can enjoy the game . Not only did the party in front of us was clearly annoyed by asking they purposely made issues . Again I went to management . They told me there is nothing they can do . I am with a family of 15+ !!! We are here having a good time -trying to watch the game . Then they asked if I wanted to move to the bar ALONE  !!!!!  Yes NOT ACCOMMODATING let's move this young lady away from her party of 15 instead of ensuring my comfort and Saftey . Not only did we pay a good amount of money , management could care less about their guests . I have worked in the industry and I am always professional and do everything to accommodate guests . That's just common curtesy . This place was an absolute let down and safe to say not retiring next year or any to follow",1
1624,"Great place to purchase kitchen gadgets. They have EVERYTHING here. Things I can't find at Ikea, Cost Plus, Target, etc. can always turn up at Sur La Table. There is a myth that things here are overpriced, and that is bunk. If you compare the same item at SLT and say Target, they will be about the same, thing is SLT really only carries high end products, whereas at other places you can pay a lower price by purchasing off-brand crap.

Great selection of Shun knives (they have other brands too but I'm partial to Shun.)",5

All I can say is thank goodness for Yelp.  You don't have to make the same mistake as me.  STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE!  There are hundreds and hundreds of hotels in Las Vegas.  Don't waste your time here.  Trust me, they don't care about you or your experience...or repeat business either!

1634,"One of my go to drinking places. Love this place.  

This place is pretty much self served. You order at the counters and wait for it. Then you can sit anywhere you want. 

I come here with my friends to get the sangria. They have the best sangria in town. Well in my opinion. I love it. I always get the red wine sangria but the white wine sangria is ok too. Sometimes we get a pitcher of beer too. Sometimes they have specials. 

They also have a side for cakes, coffee and tea. They have a wide selection of cakes and they are delicious. 

Alcohol and cake who would love that. They also have food too if you get hungry. The foods pretty tasty as well. 

Price wise, relatively cheap.",5

1641,"My friends started a bike gang this past spring, and while we might temporarily be restrained from roaming the streets a la Sons of Anarchy as it is 100¬∫ out... we aren't messing around.  

After I passed my initiation test, I wanted to bike to spring training games too, I realized I was missing some vital equipment... a bike.  Wait a minute, Dirty Harry was still sitting in my mom's backyard since I graduated college.  Boom.

After 3 years of sun and rain, Dirty Harry (who I never owned in pristine condition as it is) was hanging on by a thread.  I searched Yelp for bike repair near my work and found Old Town Beach Cruisers.  I called 'em up and they stayed open late on a Friday eve for me to bring him by and asses the damage, was he salvageable?

You betcha: 2 tire tubes, basket wire bending, a chain, some oil, and some new rubber handle grips later... he was back in working-wicked-fast-order, rusted out fenders still included (so vintage).  This bike just does not know when to quit, that's all that needed replacing after years of neglect?  The nice(r) part was they didn't try to upsell me, were very friendly, and had everything done and ready to go by 10 am the next morning.  They even called to let me know he was ready to roll.

I'm thinking about adding a better seat for the upcoming Easy Rider season, and this place seemed to have a nice variety of well priced options to choose from... so I will be back.  They also do renting along with repairs and bike sales; it looks to be a pretty nice set up for those visiting for Spring Training.",5
1642,"I wandered in here after bar hopping. The food was so amazing, I decided that I had to come back when I was sober to make an actual judgement on if it was as delicious as I thought it was.

It was.

This quickly became one of my favorite places to grab food on East Carson. I honestly think this taco place beats out the famed Las Palmas, in Oakland, as well as Reyna's in the Strip. The tacos offered here may not be as 'authentic', but the fusion of American and Mexican in a no-nonsense way is kind of really amazing. 

I think I've tried every taco offered, and they're all good. However, my favorites are the pork tacos, and the chicken nachos. The prices are extremely reasonable ($3 a taco, $5 for nachos), and they take cards! They also serve soda in glass bottles, which is nice. 

The place is open late on weekends, making it the perfect drunk munchie sort of place.",5
1643,"MAC PRO STORE. Thank you. That is primarily why I go. It is a must see when in Vegas. Many high end stores, Louis Vuitton, Zegna, Roberto Cavalli, etc.. They have Intermix and other good stores. I actually don't usually ever shop at the Gap, but for some reason the one at the Forum,, I LOVE. I love the new 'wing' they added on, with the curvy escalater and a very nice Ted Baker and Anthropologie over there. Lots of places to eat. They have animatronic statues that do 'shows' thru out the day. The 'show' down by cheesecake factory is the worst to get stuck in when its over.. blah. Overall its a nice shopping experience, usually fairly crowded but what can you do, its Vegas ?",5

1649,"This is one of my favourite places for take out. I have never had a bad meal here.  

I agree with some other reviewers on slow service at times - however it's a family business and its understandable that they can't hire an army of waiters.  On those extremely busy nights even the cooks help bring out the food and they are always friendly.  They really try hard...

I prefer take out since I'm pressed for time and sitting in such a small space leaves my clothes smelling of tempura :))",5
1650,"Fantastic little neighborhood Thai restaurant. We're all about the Pumpkin Curry, but Sala Thai has a lot more than one dish to offer. 

The atmosphere. It's intimate, with pretty much every square inch of wall space filled with kitschy artwork and memorabilia.

The napkins. Neatly folded in birdlike form with a fork inserted.

The presentation. Food is served in a manner consistent with a much more expensive restaurant.

The menu. Pumpkin Curry! What more need be said?

In all seriousness. I love the food. There is plenty of variety on the menu. Those in search of heat will find it. Those not can find safe refuge. Servers routinely ask for your heat preference on a scale of one to five, with five being hottest. Keep in mind it's an Asian scale. I'd suggest you go no higher than a three, my preference, even it you like your food spicy. Go higher at your own risk.

They will ask you to pay in cash if possible. We paid with a credit card on our most recent visit, without problem or comment. It's just a small business understandably trying to avoid high credit card fees. I'm fine with that if it helps keep their prices reasonable.",5
1653,"This is, by far, the most obnoxious restaurant in Montreal. 
The stellar reviews here are mostly coming from out-of-towners but for local Montrealers, Buona Notte is a bit of parody of itself and the whole ""St.Laurent Street"" scene. See, back in the late 1980s, that area of St. Laurent between Sherbrooke and Pine was where all the most exclusive restos and clubs were, filled to the hilt with the beautiful people, aspiring actresses, models and high-end escorts, places like Business, Mediterraneo or DiSalvio's. Most of them are long-gone now and only Buona Notte still hangs on. Come Formula 1 weekend, you can only book a table at Buona Notte if you agree to the $5000 ""bottling fee""  and its filled with F1 jet-set types and the aforementioned models and escorts-types hoping to make a break. The reek of desperation and posturing and posing is enough to make you lose your meal.

This has a good-looks-and-money entrance policy. If you don't make the cut, you're not getting in and even if you do have a reservation, they'll place you at one of the worse-off tables in the back near the kitchen and no where near the front. I came here once on a date years ago and I remember the waitresses in skimpy super-tight dresses, the wall of signed plates by the likes of Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran-fame or Jerry Lewis. As for the food, it was awful, bland and over-priced beyond belief. When you come to Buona Notte, you're not coming here for the food. You're coming here to see and to be seen and that really irritates an avowed leftist and anarchist like myself.",1
1658,"Hooray!  A yummy Middle Eastern food place!

After leaving the east side of Michigan, man did I not realize how good the middle Eastern food was, until I moved away! Ever since I've moved to Cleveland, I've been on the hunt for some good fast food Middle Eastern food.

And Dolce Wraps delivers!

What a name. And the font of the sign is so Disney-like, it definitely threw me off. Huh? Middle Eastern food in that place? No way!

And it's cheap too. Double plus.

We ordered the chicken moroccan plate. Oh man. YUM. The meat was cooked well, spiced perfectly, with good rice and salad on the side. We ordered some hummus as well, which was nice and smooth.

But man, the AGLIO (aka garlic sauce). BEST GARLIC SAUCE EVER!! There was one place in Ann Arbor that I liked to frequent for its garlic sauce, but nothing compared to Dolce Wraps- it's like this spicy hot garlic sauce that they give you, on the side, to compliment your food. Oh man, expect bad breath, but if you love garlic...Mmmm...winner!

And the owners were nice. My bf went to ask for a lid for our hummus...the owner asked him to hand him our hummus bowl, and the owner slopped some more hummus in it, and gave us a lid. We were a little flabbergasted- HUH???? haha. It was nice though- what a plus. :)

Great service, great food, and hey, you can do your shopping at Earthfare afterwards. :)",5

  Friendly service and great selection of wine.  A nice refuge in a busy airport.   The cheese selection was varied  and the burger delicious",5
1660,They really needs to hire more staff- there completely over worked and the service is VERY slow. It makes no sense why they would have just 2-3 people working on a busy Sunday when clearly they need more people. Bakerbotts also will not sell pints of icecream because there too busy. I literally have walked away without buying anything 4 times in a row because there was only 2 staff working and a 15 person line. Whoever owns this business is clearly all about the cash cow and not about the employees or patrons,1
1661,"I was really P'd off, I was on a date and the girl didnt take my date's order and kept telling me it 9 bucks for my sandwich and a coke, honestly when is 9 bucks a good deal, it isnt.

1662,The Dim Sum was below average. I was with my THAI wife and son. It was really strange the staff wanted to touch my son during the entire meal. I ask one female server not to touch my son 17 month old. She continued to hang around our table wierd. The people sitting next to us thought it was crazy. We will not be going back.,1
1664,"I checked this coffee shop out in between work events and really liked it. It seems like there aren't that many coffee shops in Arizona that roast their own beans. This place does. 

The environment was slightly upbeat and everyone was having a nice time. It was still relaxed enough that you could do homework there though! The coffee roaster is out in the open in display which is a nice touch.

I had a drip coffee. It was their single origin Guatemalan. It tastes relatively freshly roasted and it was easy to drink black. A mark of an  experienced coffee roaster. 

You won't regret going here :)",5
1665,Hands down one of the best bike shops in town.  All of the employees are extremely knowledgable in what they do. They're very upfront and honest which I can respect.  If your looking for wal-mart prices then don't waste your time. These bikes are top notch bikes that will last you a VERY long time for only a little bit more money.  Stop being cheap and treat yourself to a bike that you deserve. I'm no way affiliated with this store.  I actually live in California and they will have me as a customer from here on out!,5

The food was sooo good - started with the house noodle soup (crazy flavorful) then agedashi (very generous and delicious) and then the gyoza (fried to perfection). Then came the sushi (volcano roll - awesome presentation) tempura california roll and cucumber rolls - perfection. Highly recommended.,5

1678,"Terrific restaurant. Family owned and run by various members of the family. Dad wears the chef hat and his kids take care of the tables. We should all make an effort to support local business such as this, but this place makes it a complete joy to do so- full tummies and all. 

On a recent visit to my home town, we hosted my mothers birthday dinner here. The food was so good we came back again before we left town. You simply can't go wrong here. The entire table loved their mains, everything  from the Lamb chops to the Lasagna. You do have to come with some patience but trust me when I say it pays off- as the head Chef (Dad) plates up every dish himself and makes sure it's noting short of perfect. Two of our guests ordered the Lamb Chops which came out cooked to perfection, literally. Not undercooked or overcooked, just cooked perfectly- which by the way even the best of restaurants can't seem to nail. The rest of us carb loving people ordered pasta and weren't at all disappointed. If my husbands comment doesn't put it in perspective, I don't know what does- ""I love you and your lasagna but this is the best lasagna I've ever had."" Promptly followed by a kiss of course, soften the blow. But I don't mind, because on our second trip back to this gem, I order d the lasagna and he was right! So good. I need to up my lasagna game. 

As for Wine, they have a good selection. They carry genuine Chianti from Italy. Which is impressive. To be a genuine chianti it has to the have the black Rooster label and a serial number as this specific type of wine is governed by the Italian government. If you ever have a bottle of Chianti without these two distinguishing marks- it's not legit. I learnt all of this during a trip to Italy last year, and legit chianti is truly delicious. 


Bottomline, this is the place to go for a traditional Italian experience- from the wine to the food. Reservations recommended.",5

1684,"I have total respect for our first responders, however when here is no need for guns to be drawn Mesa PD seems to be bothered with issues that concern citizens in their neighborhood. For example, I have called five times within the last month and a half to have speed enforcement set up in our neighborhood. There are cars constantly running stop signs, vehicles speeding well in excess of 30 mph, tailgating because some vehicles follow the speed limit, and even some idiots driving in the wrong side of the road because they are on their phones. Question: Will it take some child in a bicycle or walking to school to get seriously hurt before we do something about this? I have no vested interest in this since my kids are all adults and have moved out of our house, however this is my neighborhood and have been here twenty one years and enjoy seeing kids play ball on the street, ride their bikes to school, couples walking their dogs daily but their safety is at risk because my concerns keep getting ignored. Thank you Mesa PD!!!",1

I counted 73 piles on the trail in just 3.8 miles this morning.  The stench and flies are ridiculous and staff just can't be consistent to pick it up.  I've called, emailed and called more and have complained when I enter but it doesn't change.  The grouch Rose at the entry station has issues, I don't know what her problem is but I bet it's hard to pronounce.",1

Out of the 6 grocery items Mr B. just brought home, 3 items need to be returned.  The hot dogs had expiration date of July 10th, the buns had specks of mold and the cream cheese had expiration of March /17! That's dairy products THREE months past and it's still on shelves? That's pretty bad guys.",1

1710,Fun and elegant happy hour! Lite bites and also a glorious wine list! Service was quick and assistive. Patio was lit with heaters for warmth on a chilly night. I had the carpaccio and baked brie which were fab! Both were tasty and would definitely order again. Wine was served in proper glasses and so many to choose from. It is a pricey place but a superb place for an elegant happy hour,5
1712,"Was in Vegas and stumbled across this place when looking for a breakfast joint to go to near downtown on Yelp. There was such a variety of uncommon donut flavors (Nutella, mud pie, strawberry cheesecake, Homer Simpson) and the donuts were huge! I asked the guy at the counter for a recommendation, since there were so many choices, and he said to try the French toast donut. So I ordered and when it came out, it was a huge donut with butter, syrup, and blueberry compote on the side. I took the first bite with butter and dipped in syrup and I think the sky parted and  I heard angels singing!!! The lightest French toast ever!!! What a combo! My girlfriend had the strawberry cheesecake and said it was amazing! We will be back here the next time we are in Vegas. They only served this donut Sat and Sun, from what the guy said, so if you have a cheat meal and in Vegas for a weekend, this is the meal to have.   It's right down the street from the Mob Museum, which was also a great place to visit after having a foodgasm.",5
1713,"This is definitely New York Chinese food! The smell, the flavor...finally some next level yumminess! LOL! I broke my diet just because I couldn't resist. As far as I am from home, I found a place that transported me back...at least partially. No complaints, only compliments!",5
1714,"This is a must when visiting Las Vegas. The entire cycle takes 30 minutes, providing ample time to take a lot of photos. This is probably my favorite attraction in Vegas right now. The High Roller is the largest observation wheel in the World. There are two different prices for day and night. Its a bit on the high side for an attraction that takes less than an hour of your day to complete, but its worth the experience. 

Great for kids! The wheel moves very slowly, and there is many other people in the ""pod"" providing a safe environment for families. The High Roller is very close to a Las Vegas Monorail stop.",5
1715,"Saturday afternoon we (along with 6 friends) purchased tickets for the 5-520 pm Zoom on Sunday.  We waited in line for 90 mins before we were allowed up to main platform where we found we would have at least another 90min-2hr wait.  When employees were asked what seemed to be the trouble and how much longer the delay would be, no one could/would give any explanation.  We were finally, 2.5 hours after our arrival, told we could get a refund or reschedule for another time.  Reschedule ... really ... we wasted almost 3 hours standing in line, why would we want to come back?  The attitude of the staff makes one think this situation happens more often than not.  
Slotzilla should, if nothing else have a manager on site who is willing to inform their customers about delays and provide options more quickly although I doubt based on the response of their employees that will be the case.",1
1716,I love the benefit brow bar at Macy's! The lady's who work here are super friendly and I find myself getting into deep conversations with them!! #trueretailtherapy,5
1717,"My House Chinese Cuisine just opened up around the corner from me. I've been waiting patiently for them to open and am glad they finally did! I have a weak spot for Chinese take out, and always welcome any new places to hopefully add to my rotation. 
I left this morning to find a menu to My House on my doorstep..... I took this as a sign that I HAVE to try this for dinner. I had plenty of time to peruse the menu, and decided on walnut shrimp, green jade vegetables, and crab rangoons.

Here's my verdict on each of my menu items I ordered:

Walnut Shrimp - generous portion! Large shrimp,  lightly  breaded and flavorful on their own. Complimented well by the walnuts and the white sauce. I especially love that this wasnt drenched and drowning in sauce. It allowed for the other flavors to shine through.

Green Jade Vegetables - as you may have guessed it.... this is an entree of green veggies. Green beans, broccoli, snap peas tossed in a white sauce. Again, lightly sauced not soaking in sauce. Very flavorful for a side of veggies, I was pleasantly surprised.

Crab Rangoons - Aahhhh yes, crab rangoons, my guilty pleasure. One of the deciding factors I consider whether I will return to a Chinese  restaurant is how much I like their crab rangoons.  These were top notch. The wonton wrappers were fried perfectly. Light crunch, good texture.... not hard or too chewy. The cream cheese filling was seasoned/ filled with something magical that I thoroughly enjoyed.

Needless to say, I'll be back. I wish this business all the luck. If they keep up with the quality food they served up tonight, they will do extremely well.",5
1718,"I am a loyal Canopi Customer and the only reason for that, the only reason is because they offer a variety of the specific oil products I use. There was only 2 people before me in today's visit and still it was taking a while so their Manager finally decides to work instead of flirting with the front desk girl, but I wish he hadn't. First of all he had a mug in his hand the whole time so we know he's in charge, he was condescending and didn't know the answers to my questions and probably felt insecure for that, he made me feel very awkward pretty much the whole he was there. His name is Chris, I made sure to get his name to post this review.",1
1719,"I am extremely satisfied with all the repairs and services that Stuttgart Southwest has performed on my 2005 Porsche 911S over the last several years. Every time that I brought my car in for service Jack (the owner) explain every aspect of the repairs that needed to be performed. Never tried to oversell and prices are considerably better than the dealer. 

I had my car in for an oil change, broken door handle and an intermittent off Idle hesitation when rapidly pressing the throttle wide open. They were unable to find any fault code in the computer that was causing the issue. I installed a Fabspeed  air intake system a while back that he thought that the intake could be causing the issue or mass airflow sensor.  He suggested that I reinstall the factory intake as the aftermarket intake is great for the track but not good for daily driving and the 110¬∞ heat in Phoenix.  I reinstalled the factory air intake as suggested and car is running great again.

They are the best  auto repair shop I ever used!",5
1720,"It upsets me to leave this kind of review after my experience with this place because I try my best to give places and people the benefit of the doubt but I feel it's necessary in case someone is considering this establishment. Please, take your money elsewhere.

I was given a gift certificate to get a massage by my boyfriend as I have severe arthritis and I've been wanting to take a day off work to fully relax and enjoy it. When I first called to schedule my appointment, the girl who answered sounded very short and as if she didn't want to be on the phone. 

I told her I was calling to schedule an appointment and she put me down for 2:00. She never asked what I was looking to come in for or even explained anything. This was my first time, so I was unsure what the process was so it was partially my mistake for not asking what the process was and assumed I had to go in and tell them what I wanted.

I arrived 30 minutes early. The greeting I received was awkward but I gave them my name. I was told to have a seat but I was confused about doing so without filling out paperwork so I asked if I was to do so. The girl was like, ""Oh yeah, here you go...""

As I'm filling out the paperwork, I begin to realize that none of the questions seemed to pertain to the service I wanted. At one point, I asked her if I had the correct paperwork but then dismissed it because I saw questions asking about allergies so I figured maybe I was ocerthinking things.... I was utterly confused but did not want to seem like I was nitpicking so I handed over the paperwork and took a seat.

I got called back by a nice woman and she said, ""So is this your first time having a microdermabrasion?"" I immediately let out a ""whoa"" and explained the miscommunication done by the front staff and told her I only wanted a massage and that I didn't even know what a microdermabrasion was, and that I was scheduled for this without being asked what I wanted. 

She looked upset but reassured me we would go to the front desk to get what I wanted. I apologized to her because I felt terrible that she could have had a client for her services but instead, didn't because of what happened! So off to the front desk we go and I explained what the situation was. They apologized and told me to come back at 4 pm for a hot stone massage that I wanted. I was worried at this point and didn't even want to return but I did and wish I had just stayed at home instead.

The massage was okay and the woman who did it tried her best to make me feel relaxed and less tense from my arthritis. I did NOT get the hot stone treatment. Instead I got charged for the hour long massage ($89) and didn't even get the remaining amount left over from the $100 gift certificate. 

To be honest, I don't even want it. After my experience that was supposed to be relaxing, welcoming and stress free, I left trying not to be that rude and upset customer even though I was trying to hold back frustration and tears, and left with the intention of never coming back or recommending this place to anyone! 

Also, ALWAYS check the reviews on yelp instead of putting your trust into the reviews left on Google. Completely misleading and after reading the reviews on here, I can say the reviews on poor customer service is very spot on and accurate.

First impressions are everything and my experience here was enough to make me want to speak out and warn others!!",1
1721,"Absolute worst experience of my life!!!!! The manager gru-Paul cadence and attitude is the poorest example of a hotel manager in Las Vegas. Security is rude- and to top it all off check in is at after 2pm but my room wasn't ready till 7:30pm!!! Next time I'll rather pay the extra $$ to stay at a better hotel with better employees and better customer service and no crack addicts in the lobby. Thanks but no thanks. Oh also don't touch anything - U will be charged for waters even if u don't use them -
Mine were left exactly as is just on another side of the room but charged anyway. 
I decided to pursue theft charges against the hotel - I would glady give someone 30$ to not stay here!!!!!",1
1722,"ordered last night for the first time through door dash delivery service.  well YUM.  i had a cold and the hot and sour soup was just what I needed.  the food we ordered was hot, fresh, and delicious.  definitely eating here again.",5
1723,"SO MUCH FUN!!   Went with two other couples and having heard the place was typically busy, we went early-6:00 and planned on putting our name in for a bay and then have dinner while we waited.  This worked our perfectly.   We ordered our food and very shortly after we were done eating, we got the text that our bay was ready.  Note that each player needs to buy a $5 dollar players card which is good forever and is how the game play works.  You load the card with money and swipe it in at your booth.  Make sure what line you are in when you enter so you don't end up standing in a line that you didn't need to be in, they have kiosks for the cards.

So, for the food, surprisingly it was really good.  Between the group, we had a pretty good mix of plates on the table and everyone was really happy with their order.  I had the basic cheeseburger- but there was a cobb salad, club sandwich and a few other dishes- all the main dishes ran about $10 ish.  

The wait staff was on top of all our needs the entire time and let me tell you the place was packed!

Game time- we were in a bay on the second floor and had a couch, there are some bays that have tall tables but I think either would be comfortable for a group.  They did have heaters that you control in your bay if needed-we did not. 

 There are several games you can choose to play, all varying around lighted/colored circles out in the range.  You pay per hour and we played two hours.  The price varies depending on the time of day, for us it was $45 per hour for the bay.  Again, outside the waitstaff was always in the ready and drinks, deserts etc  were delivered quickly and with a smile.  It was so pleasant- good job to TopGolf for training and customer service!! 

Before I sign off- one quick tip- order the  injectable donut holes- yep, creme, raspberry and chocolate- fun and yum!",5
1725,"Jessica is the best. She truly knows what she is doing and is endlessly passionate about transforming people! She's a pleasure to be around and leaving with incredible hair is the best bonus, ever.",5
1726,"I have been coming here for years and it is hands down my favorite Chinese and Thai restaurant in town. Hundreds of items to choose from and anything I've ever ordered has been delicious. Also, quite affordable.",5
1727,"I don't understand how this place has gotten such high reviews. I went in expecting a 4.5 star restaurant but was very disappointed. First off, they brought us tea in a pot and this is the first time I get charged for tea at a sushi place. The tea tasted like water. And the soy sauce tasted like water, we had a strong suspicion they water it down. It was horrible. And you really needed the taste of soy sauce to help you out because the rolls themselves tasted so bland. One of the rolls we got I think it was the siren, was basically a salad. A salad without any dressing. Just a bunch of mint leaves and a cm sized shrimp. 
The waiters, although polite, kept hovering around us and made us uncomfortable. Oh and they also charge for ginger and wasabi (it doesn't even come with the specialty rolls order)  they also brought out our sushi two orders at a time instead of all at once which I didn't like. 
Also, each roll was the size of my hand. Please make your rolls smaller and bite size! Don't make it impossible/embarrassing for us to try to chew/choke on it. 
In the end, for three people,  our bill came out to $100. Pretty outrageous for less than mediocre sushi.
I definitely disappointed my guests by bringing them here based on reviews. Yelp did not come through this time unfortunately.",1
1729,"Finally...a fast casual and good restaurant in Noda! We love this place. The food is great, service is good, and prices are on par with the others restaurants in this class. The seating can be a bit limited during really busy times, but since the tables turn over quickly it's not really a problem to find a place to sit. Highly recommend.",5
1730,"Great place for mid-century/mod furniture. Get yer Eames, McCobb, Nelson, and more unusual suspects here. Doug, the owner, is charming and super-knowledgeable. I think it's only open Friday to Sunday. Or is it Thursday to Saturday? Call ahead.",5
1731,"Had a great experience! Made a reservation a few weeks back for a Mercedes CLA 250. Reading the reviews was not expecting it to be available upon arrival. I got the Sixt app, which allowed me to check what car I got. 30 ministers before the pickup it said I was assigned a Volvo. All I had to do was press the switch cars button, which allowed me to switch to a Mercedes cla 250 for no extra charge (or I could upgrade for a fee). Upon arriving to the Sixt station There was only one person ahead of me. The agent did not push any insurance on me or anything like that once I told him I will be using my regular car insurance. The process took less than 5 minutes. A few minutes later I was in a 2018 Mercedes. Rented the car one-way for 10 days and dropped it off in LA and only paid $240 total, what a steal! Overall had a great experience with Sixt",5
1733,"Jamie

 

It was a pleasure to work with you, Jared and your staff. From the moment I met him until the job was completed your company was amazing. 

 

Quality, professionalism, fair pricing and finished on time.

 

What more could any consumer ask for.

 

I would highly recommend your company to anyone

 

Keep up the good work.",5
1734,"Let me start by saying I am from the Deep South.  I moved here from the Mississippi Delta (just south of Memphis) four years ago.  With that being said, I happen to know two things in life- good food and good people. 

Today was the second time I have picked up a catering order from Road Kill for my office.  I am currently still in a euphoric state.  Pulled pork, brisket, collard greens, Mac n cheese, Cole slaw & peach cobbler is what we picked up today.  The food is on point and everybody at work agrees.  Shout out to Rita for helping me place my order and ALL of the staff for their friendly disposition.  There is nothing sub-par about this place.  They have THE BEST barbecue this side of the Mississippi.  I HIGHLY recommend doing business with John Mulls/Road Kill Grill.",5
1735,Was referred here by a relative of the owner. I went and loved my pink & white acrylic nails! It's hard to find anyone who wants to do acrylic anymore. All want to do SNS dip. I do not like the dip method with pink & white. Found my new place even though it's a 20 minute drive from my house. Absolutely worth it!,5
1739,"Food is good... But service with Jennifer at the new Stephanie location in Henderson was not very helpful with 
Extra charges that appeared on our bill....will think twice before heading there again for a $13 sandwich",1
1740,"Yeah, I am going all-out and giving this place 5 stars. Here's why: when I moved here in February, I moved from Hawaii. Yes, that Hawaii. With a fabulous hey-I-just-caught-this-ahi-let's-cook-this-up mentality. When I moved in the dead of winter, I wanted fish like in Hawaii. Whatdoyouknow, they had ahi from Hawaii. Let me just set up my tent and live in this restaurant! Fantastic preparations, fabulous sides and seafood flown in from Hawaii. Served up by great bartenders and waiters and I'm sold. 

I have been going there at least every 2 weeks since February. Now they have wahoo from Hawaii on the menu. There is a word in Hawaiian for delicious, it's ono. Ono is also the name used for wahoo. Seriously delicious. If you can, go to Mitchell's for any fresh fish, but make sure to try the ono-I mean wahoo. All the fresh fish is amazingly ono!!!",5
1741,Clean and cute exercise studio. Took BUTI yoga with Dre- she was friendly and offered different variations of poses to challenge us. I'm giving 5 stars because of her!,5
1742,"My favorite  fish store in Phoenix!!!  The tanks are clean, cared for and loved.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and they are a locally owned company.  Their prices are reasonable and not outrageous.  So they may be a few bucks more than the local big box pet stores but what you get in return are healthy happy fish and isn't that why we are all in this hobby???   

btw...if you get a chance ask for Chris...super nice and knowledgeable guy and helped get my 90 gallon up and running from lights to filter and heater to fish.",5
1743,"One would typically think that going through a drivethrough may somewhat insinuate someone might be eating in the car! Hub ordered a chicken sandwich (plain, only cheese), myself, 3 small sides (corn, mashed potatoes and mac and cheese). We are told this will be 17 dollars!? Wow! So this starts a car fight of how this can possibly be so? So, when we get the window, it's actually 13. Okay, that's better. As we pull off to head to our event for the evening, we open the bag to find there is no fork, no napkins, and  his sandwich is the absolute farthest thing from ""Plain"". Sauce ran off the wrapper into his hand. Crap, if only we'd had a napkin!?
If you come here check your order well, and if planning non inside dining, bring your own silverware and napkins! Or swear and run across to the Fry's deli across the street for the items.",1
1744,"Busy shop but a short wait-fast and friendly and thorough service. Can't beat the $7.77 smog with Yelp Check-in, either!",5
1746,Had the stuffed French Toast. A new twist to French toast. Absolutely delicious . Loved the seasoned country potatoes. I would definitely come back and recommend this place.,5
1747,"I have been going here for a while now. The first time I went to the bakery I picked up some cookies and ended up consuming all of them before I was halfway home. I turned around and went back and Carrie (the owner) thought something was wrong. Yes, something was wrong, I was out of cookies! I purchased more for home. 

Get the homemade chocolate raspberry truffles (in the cooler months) and the caramel brownies. Macaroons are fantastic. 

It's a real pleasure to support someone who is obviously passionate about what she does.

Check the hours- like any small bakery, she closes around 2PM on most days.",5
1748,"My husband and I had our first date here, and he later proposed here as well, so The Keg holds a special place in my heart, and we come back for all of our special occasions. We have been married 5 years and still love to request ""our"" table. We visited last week for my birthday dinner, and one of the perks is the free birthday entree they send you if you sign up via email. The food never disappoints, and I love the drink selections. My steak came out well done when I had requested medium, and our server Gentry was quick to bring me a new plate, perfectly cooked this time. Not only was Gentry's service impeccable, but the manager Kelly took care of my dinner and extended my free birthday meal for another month, and sent us dessert on top of everything. I have visited other locations and this one is hands down the best when it comes to service and food quality. We will continue to be loyal patrons for many years to come!",5

1753,"I had the chipotle chicken sandwich and it was delicious! The bread was the best part. It was crunchy on the outside, but soft on the inside. Just perfect!!",5
1758,"STAY AWAY. I did my research on the company and did see a couple negative reviews but thought they might be a ""one off"" experience or hard to please customers.  The price was great and about $100 less than the other companies.  YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.  Only ONE bellhop showed up for the job.  The company called me multiple times and said that they were sending someone else while the ONE guy was moving everything out of my building. Eventually another Bellhop did show up..for about 45 minutes.. rushed and stressed me out even more and when I got the bill I saw they charged me for him being there for two hours.

The ONE bellhop that was there from the beginning had one more run to make.  He had dragged my mattress out in the hall way of my apartment building and said he would be right back. When the mover didn't come back after an hour I went to look for him.  The mover and the truck driver were NO WHERE in sight.  My furniture was sitting out on a VERY BUSY road with the truck door open.  The ONE bellhop that showed up JUST UP AND LEFT. My mother and I had to drag my mattress back inside of my apartment and I had to sit outside to make sure no one was stealing literally all of my belongings. During the lull of...an hour..hour and a half...of not knowing where the truck driver was and realizing that the mover just BAILED an ambulance showed up at my apartment building and the truck was blocking the cop and paramedics from the easiest access to the patient. 

Eventually about two hours later the company sent two more bellhops out and they were able to finally finish the job.  It took the company 10 hours to move out of a 600 sq ft studio. The truck was loaded terribly and it looked like the boxes marked fragile were purposely thrown around..they were dented and some of the belongings inside were broken. 

The company charged me for 10 hours of bellhops and 10 hours of moving.  At first they told me they would take off the price of the truck....I refuse to pay for 10 hours of moving when it should have taken three hours AT MOST.  It was not my fault that the company has unreliable employees.  After multiple phone calls and added stress by bill was ""discounted"" and ended up paying way too much for this NIGHTMARE of a move.  

Honestly just look through the reviews...every other review shows an issue or a bell hop not showing up.  Please learn from my experience and hire a different moving company.  It was not worth saving $100 for all the stress and headache I went through.",1
1759,The office is small and quaint the wait time was not bad at all the DR was very kind and thorough in explaining to me what is going on with my daughters tonsils.,5
1760,Yeah so I called last night about 20 till close. They take my order and told me it will be 45-1hr for delivery... Hour and 15 mins later I call to confirm. No answer and THEY NEVER DELIVERED THE PIZZA!!! I checked my account and they didn't charge me luckily but who runs a business like this?? Just tell me you aren't going to deliver. Very very disappointed in this place. Screw them we just wanted pizza!! Will not use this place in the future and might not use a dominos again!!,1
1761,Great experience. Food looks and tastes great! Lovely staff. Just moved near and will be back again. Loved the black rice sushi.,5
1764,"Great place!  It's in Ceasar's forum shops on the 3rd floor.  I sat at the sushi bar and they treated me so nicely.  Very good service and the food was good!  Fresh sushi, great rolls and interesting appetizers.  I had the spicy yellowtail rolls and the toro jalapeno which rocked!  Really good food, cool place, good service.",5
1765,Recently had lunch for my bday here with my family. The meat that had us going was the lamb chops!! Beautiful place when u want some quality meat. The best! My little sister had her wedding reception here few years back. Service was perfect!!! Can't wait to go back.,5
1766,The service was terrible. The food was just ok. Dessert was the best part of the whole experience.,1
1767,"I ended up being very disappointed by this company.  I had heard good things about them and liked the sale representative, Mike, when he came out to my house.  He spent more than an hour measuring and talking to me about options which I was very interested in.  I was told a quote would come in about a week.  When nothing came I followed up with Mike who referred me to Ester.  Ester told me the quote was going to someone's desk for review and I would have it in a few days.  After another couple week I called again asking if they had anything for me.  I was told one of the employees had some personal issues, they were sorry and would get the quote right over to me.  After another week and a half  I called the sales person, Mike.  I told him normally I would be long gone but I really liked some of the things he said.  I told him if they were not interest in my job to just let me know and I would stop bugging them.  Mike told me that was not the case at all and that he was going to go speak with Ester and would make sure they got the quote right over to me.  That was over a week and a half ago and still nothing.  After 6-weeks I think it is time to give up on these guys.  If it is this hard to get a quote to someone who is very interested in working with them, I fear what the actual job would have gone like.",1
1768,"Visiting Toronto from LA and was told this was the place to try. I'm sorry but the food was horrible. I tried a few plates and every single one was actually pretty gross. The worst plate was the grilled octopus, chewy beyond any octopus I have ever had I actually couldn't bring myself to even finish it. The scene was more a drunk businessmen man vibe then anything, and the Sangria they sell walking around the tables tastes like some crappy kids juice box. I'm a foodie and if you're looking for a food experience take a pass on this place the food is horrible. Disappointed on my birthday with a gross meal.",1
1769,"Best sashimi I have ever had.  The smoked salmon, yellow tail and scallop nigiri were all awesome.  The salad was very pretty and tasty.  The miso soup was the only part that was a disappointment...as it was very bland and flavorless.",5
1770,"If I could give a negative number, I would. This salon is a den of unprofessional, backbiting, immature subpar vipers. TAYLOR originally did my extensions, which were a HOT MESS with tape sticking out all over, extensions all the way up to my crown so not enough natural hair covered them, and the hair used was cheap and not of good quality! When I came in for extensions, Taylor used a razor and butchered my natural hair (without asking permission ), so taking the crappy extensions out wasn't even an option! Taylor seriously has no clue how to cut hair or do extenions, yet tells her first time clients her sob story (way TMI), fishing for extra tips. Super professional, huh? My hair was so bad I came back within two days and thank God I found Marisa, who saved my hair and is an AWESOME stylist! I'd give Marisa 10 stars and will follow her to any salon she goes to... I'm a client for life! She is professional,   polite, knows all aspects of color, cut and extensions... and is simply a pleasure to spend time with. I look forward to our time together each month and so completely trust her with my hair that I say do what you think will look good, and every time I leave I'm so extremely happy with my hair!! She is that awesome! For 14 months I've put up with rude inappropriate nasty comments from Taylor and the owner Crystal,  which speaks volumes of their petty immature high school mean girl mindset. But Marisa is so awesome it's worth it to keep going back. But this week Taylor crossed the line and had the nerve to talk crap about me to her client in front of my face! First of all, I never had a client relationship with Taylor, she simply answered the phone so booked the appointment with herself and then totally f'd up my hair...  Second, how is EVER ok to talk sh!t about ANY client, but especially IN FRONT OF THEM??!  I can't wait for Marisa to finally leave and go where she isn't bullied and treated like crap, but I'll put up with the rude and disrespectful behavior because I won't go to anyone else... even if she's at this crappy little salon.",1
1771,"I checked this place out recently and thought the facilities were decent.  Not as new as some other places around town, but definitely up there.  

However, at the end of my tour the pushy salesman refused to let me try a work out.  I guess he expected me to sign my life away without even working out there once.  Not gonna happen.

Based on my experience and after reading some other comments on Yelp about the sales tactics I would definitely avoid this place. There are plenty of other great gyms in the area.",1
1772,"We killed ourselves on the appetizers.  The crab-cakes are out of this world.  Drink prices weren't bad either.  My wife's filet was absolutely perfect and my prime rib was cooked just how I asked for it, ""somewhere between merely stunned and medium rare"".  The staff was very friendly and professional.  Food prices are kind of high, but still a tad lower than Lawry's.  This place is worth the trip.",5
1775,"Went in. Got a drink. $5 cover. Excited about being there. Asked bartender if we could smoke cigar. She said yes. Paid for our drinks. Was asked by the door Nazi to put out cigar. Really?!?! Too bad. One, we asked to have a cigar, two, they allow cigar and cigarette smoking inside. It's unfortunate that tourists come to a locals bar and then want to complain about smoking in an establishment where it is legal. They are more than welcome to stay in California. We  had high hopes of the lounge and the music.  They lost our business forever. As a local that supports locally owned businesses I won't be supporting this one. Too bad Bar Rescue couldn't give some of the employees good sense. Also be known there was another person smoking a cigar inside he just happened to be over by the band area. I never saw him approached to get rid of his. If I was smoking a cheap cigar, I could see they do stink but this was a Montecristo Epic.",1

1777,"A wonderful and happy place to get a morning coffee with homemade fresh pastries. Lemon lavender scones, almond butter and strawberry jam toasted bruschetta wee scrumptious. The latte was so fresh and flavorful. I'm a picky coffee person and they won me over! They have lunches and cool salad options. Love it!",5
1778,"We have grown to appreciate Patrick Riley, they offer top notch service. At our previous home, we used another vendor and they let us down. They fixed the A/C under warranty every 2-3 months but it was really poorly installed and then one weekend the company refused to call back or come out. I quickly found Patrick Riley, they came out - revamped the entire system- got it up and running and replaced some key parts that were missing in the electrical and charged us only $200.00 for the parts.  We signed a service contract and never used it! Their fix was the BEST and it never broke after they fixed it.  Prior to selling the home they provided us with a free inspection and shared the information with the realtors. It was super service. Then at the new home we were delighted to find we could move our contract over. We received excellent support as we moved in and repaired our existing A/C unit - such great support we turned to them to buy a new unit, received a member discount and had it installed in 4 hours. It was that simple.  They have NEVER been late to an appointment, always call in the morning, and have been very professional.  The only time we were not happy was when they asked if we wanted someone from the plumbing company to do an inspection and we were not satisfied with that person or their professionalism.  I prefer the A/C and will stick with that for now. Not even worth taking off a star.",5
1779,"Just a Deli that sells $.99 shrimp cocktails. You'll have to wind through the casino to find it, but it's worth it if you like to budget.",5
1781,"This particular chipotle deserves no stars. With a staff that is not only slow, they are also incompetent and bad at making food. The service is incredibly slow, be prepared to wait even if you are the only person in line. The food is also always below the brands standard. No matter how many chances I give them, they never fail to remind me why I should just give up and go to the legacy village location. I am a big fan of chipotle but this is just an embarrassment to food service industry. Stay clear of this one.",1
1783,"Found this place using Yelp and decided to check it out. Nice little place with good ambience!!
Tried the 2 & 3 meat sampler which covered all meats available.
The Brisket and Rib Tips are the Winners!!
Tried 4 sides and the Bourbon Peaches are like eating Peach Cobbler without the crust!!
I will be visiting quite often!!",5
1787,This place is awesome. My boyfriend and I went there and loved this place. The food is perfect. I ordered the turkey chops. But what made it better was that there was a live band that friday night called Snazzi. They were awesome. Great combination of new school and old school and the lead singer was perfect. Her name was Tina. I will be going anywhere they'll be in Charlotte.,5

1792,My dogs love this place! The staff is great and you can tell they really like what they do and really care for the dogs! I love the webcam access to the majority of play and sleep areas. I recommend just like home to my friends!,5
1793,Their waffles are the best! Great spot for breakfast and brunch!,5
1794,"What a great find!!  We stopped to give the Onion Steak Sub a try and it turned out to be great!! Tony behind the counter was great, since it was our first time there, it took a few minutes to figure out what to try.  When we were finally ready, Tony took care of our orders and while waiting, we enjoyed the eclectic array of wall hangings.
The food was delivered to us within minutes and what a treat, each of the orders was great! The double burger is a man-versus-food event, the Pastrami and Swiss on the roll was a welcome treat, and their salads were fresh and delicious.  
Located to the west of the 215 just off Cheyenne, it is very easy to get to, parking is easy and the service and food are fantastic!  I'll be coming back to try more of their menu items.",5
1798,"I was recently in Arizona on vacation and needed an emergency appointment for severe tooth pain. Dr. Durisek not only saw me on short notice, but took me in on a holiday, took xrays, noticed an infected root that my home dentist missed, AND gave me a referral to an endodontist who took care of me. Amazing personal service, and caring staff. I would recommend this office to anyone looking for a knowledgeable, professional dentist. Thank you, Dr. Durisek for taking the time to help me. I will be forever grateful!
Note: Dr. Durisek's waiting room has a massage chair, snacks, and Starbucks coffee that made the experience luxurious for my family! What a great place!",5
1800,"We love this cocktail lounge for starting a night on Fremont. If youre looking for a mixologist and not just a bartender, have Jackie make your drink. She is an artist! She made me an amazing ginger lemonade cocktail and the best mojito i have ever had! Sour, but wonderful! Perfect place for a NICE, unique drink. They also have a little patio right on Fremont East for prime people-watching.

Tip: come around dinner time. It gets ghetto and crowded around 10pm",5
1802,Gary just finished my Wisconsin tattoo moments ago and I could not be MORE pleased! I am so incredibly thrilled with how it turned out. I am very glad I decided to check out Firehouse here in Stoughton. I will definitely be a regular and I can't wait to tell everyone to go see Gary! Five STARS!!,5
1804,Dave lead us on a great hike. He accommodated people of different levels so that it was enjoyable for all.  I'll definitely go on another hike and would love to try biking too.,5
1805,"OMG. These beds were so comfy! I loved the decorating in the rooms, it was simple but still sleek. However, I kind of noticed little things in the bathroom... like the hole around my shower head, the crack in the tub and the feel of the towels. A little rough there! Lol I liked that the infamous Rehab pool was there and that it wrapped around the bar, a back stroke all the way around  was fun 8) 

But as a DJ, I must give my two cents... 
The booth was waaaay to high for us to see who was mixing! I bet if it were lowered there would be better crowd interaction. Just saying.",5
1807,"The movers were very rude. One of them had difficulty carrying probably because he was older than 50. They used wet boxes, they broke a marble table, even though we hire the full service they did not move a finger to pack or wrap things. I am still waiting for the reimbursement.",1
1808,"I ordered lemon poppy seed muffins, and they were delicious! The staff is friendly and the prices are great. It doesn't get much better than that. I will definitely be back. 

I ordered a yellow cake with chocolate frosting for my girlfriend's birthday, and it was perfect! My girlfriend was really impressed, and everyone who had a piece loved it.  Also, ordering and picking up the cake was easy and hassle-free. I can't say enough about how much I like this place.",5
1809,"We had a lovely dinner here last night. We were very lucky to get a last minute reservation--we called around 4 and they had a spot available at 8:15pm. I'm glad we called because this is a small and busy restaurant. We sat at the only open table and the servers were obviously very busy. All the tables around us were groups of people and it was fairly loud. The environment was inviting, very clean, with white table cloths and paintings on the walls. My husband had a negroni and I got a 1/2 liter of pinot grigio. Service was a little slow but they were busy. They brought out a bread basket and butter with our drinks. Our water glasses stayed full & our salads came out very quickly! Salads were fresh and crisp and dressed perfectly. For our entrees my husband ordered fettuccine alfredo with chicken and I had the spaghetti carbonara. Everything was delicious! They really know what they're doing here. At the end of our meal, when the restaurant had cleared a bit, the owner came over and introduced himself. He told us a little about the restaurants history and his family. He was so proud of this family establishment. We told him we would be back when we visit Toronto next time.",5
1812,Just opened last week. Found it by accident. Margaritas are not for sissies. Great food and service. Atmosphere is authentic. Great place and we'll be back.,5
1815,Staffs are friendly and welcome me and my kids with a smile!!! And i guarantee their food is awesome! Everything is fresh! From breads to corns! Good job dirt dog!!!,5
1816,"Everything from appetizer to desert has been amazing. I love veggie rolls, tom kay and  the curry noodles. The curry noodles I need at least once a month but if I could I would have it once a week, it's just that good.",5
1818,"Melissa is an outstanding agent! She worked out perfect for us when she helped us find our home. She is very professional and friendly to work with. Has a lot of experience in the field and made our transaction run fairly and smooth. I would recommend to anyone looking for a great team, that the Dominguez-Martin Group is exceptional in customer service!

1822,We had to take time out to give a huge thank you for the quality service and outstanding employees at Simply The Best Heating and Cooling. The company came highly recommended when we replaced our air conditioners and heating unit; they gave us the best bid and we have been highly pleased with the service since the installation. They come out and service the units twice a year just before we need our heater in the winter and prior to using the air conditioner in the spring. It is nice to know our units are taken care of and ready for use. On the couple of occasions we have needed them to provide additional checks and service they have been there same day or next day to meet our needs! You will be extremely pleased with this company and we can not say enough about the courtesy of all employees! We just scheduled recent appointment received top notch service! We give them five stars and recommend them 100%! Thank you Simply The Best!,5
1823,"Linda Kaufman is amazing! She's given me two perms and a color, and they've all turned out great. She knows I'm growing my hair out and never cuts too much.

Today she took me from medium brown to copper. The first time it wasn't quite right, but she immediately recolored it. The second time was perfect! She didn't charge extra to correct it even though it took quite a bit of her time. For me, she is a stylist beyond measure! I will definitely return. Highly recommend.",5
1824,"Our family are regular visitors to Apache! Our son Erik is there several times a week. They make things, just how you want. Their carnitas are the bomb! I would highly recommend them to anyone!",5
1825,"Well well well, Hole In The Wall Crab Shack...nice to meet you! 

I'm so glad I finally got a chance to scurry on over here for a quick lunch. And oh wow was it delicious and the portions were a plenty. Since I don't want to sound like a review on repeat here are the highlights of my meal...

Crab cake: Zowie. One of the best crabby cakes I've ever had. Large, burstin' with flavor and SO full of crab. I'm not quite sure what type of magic holds all the crab together but it's insanely good. Mama likes! 

Hush puppies: Perfectly fried balls of joy. Yes, balls of joy. Wonderfully brown and crispy on the outside and a lovely spongy and delightful inside. I plowed through three of 'em so quickly.  

Broccoli: Yeah, I did it. I'm not a huge coleslaw fan so I subbed in broccoli and it was super good. I'm sure it wasn't the most healthy broccoli I've ever eaten but it was spiced and cooked just right. No limp broccoli trees here! 

The staff: Seriously some of the nicest owners & staff around. Super chatty, funny & kind. They are really happy to tell you how they get those fresh crabs every week, too! Yeah, you just want to hug 'em - both for their disposition and for their delicious food. 

Miscellaneous: As others have noted, at the moment there is no place to sit and chow. They might be moving to a new location, so keep your eyes posted if and when the address changes! Also, prepare to pay a bit more than you may be used to but the food is a) outstanding and b) very, very fresh so it's worth it. 

I'll be back to try more of the menu very, very soon!",5
1826,"Two years later - this is still my favorite Barbershop in all of Charlotte. This is no exaggeration. 

We actually ended up taking a break from visiting due to how far our travel was for this place. So we tried many - make that several barbershops that were closer to home. And every time we would leave one - my son would be complaining. They scratched him, they grabbed his head to hard or something. And he's only 7 now - but he should still be treated with the same respect that any other customer would be treated with. 

So after months of him begging, I finally took him back and he was the happiest kid I had seen in a long time. His hair is fresh again. 

We actually didn't see Danny because man was his schedule booked for the times we wanted. I tried to get in with Leon too but he was booked up. (These guys are popular - and understandably for a good reason.) 

Luckily, I was able to get in with another barber and he still did a good job with my son. 

If you are looking for a great barber, then honestly - you do not need to look any further. Clean shop, great people and great work! They stay busy - so book an appointment when you can!",5
1827,"This lovely and relatively new hotel & resort in Las Vegas is first rate! Vinny and I stayed there this summer during a quick jaunt to Vegas and really enjoyed the hotel and all of its amenities. When we first checked in, we didn't expect we'd have a good experience because right off the bat we had to wait in a 45-minute line to check in, and then, the hotel screwed up and didn't have our reservation correct. Fortunately, the folks at the Cosmopolitan more than made up for it by giving us an updated room free of charge-- and, I must say, the room was amazing!! It was a large 1 bedroom suite w/ a balcony overlooking the Bellagio hotel and fountain (yes, the very one where they do the daily fountain and light show-- what a view, I tell ya)! Plus the room had a large sunken tub and walk-in shower, a large living room seating area, and high-tech work space (yep, sadly, I had to do a little work on the trip even though we were mostly there for vacation, but the work space turned out to be a godsend for me). 

Other great features of the Cosmopolitan include their casino (it's modern looking and packed with lots of high rollers and beautiful people), their abundance of restaurants and shops, and their large pool recreation area, which features a couple of outdoor bars and plenty of lounge chairs for relaxing. 

Note that one of my favorite things about the Cosmopolitan, believe it or  not, is their Pizza restaurant. Check out my review of the Pizzeria @ The Cosmopolitan. Some of the best pizza I've ever had!!",5
1828,"Wow! This was the first time my husband and I have ever been to Carpe Diem but it will not be our last. Today was our anniversary so the decorated a private table for us. Another touch they gave us was desserts with a candle amongst other unique perks. The food was outstanding. We had the vegetable pizzetta to start, for entr√©es: salmon, and the duck. Dessert (made in house): mocha Oreo pie with mascarpone whipped cream and coconut cake with ice cream. Yum! Portions were huge for a fancy restaurant. Ask for Yolanda if you're looking for a great server. You won't be disappointed!",5
1829,"Aliments, Service, Ambiance 10/10!!!",5
1830,"Came here for an early dinner.  I had a half chicken with chimmy churri snd sweet potatoes.  

Chicken was tasty, moist and a good size.  Definitely good quality chicken.    Sweet potatoes were good,  but not special.   

Will try salads next time, they sounded very creative.",5
1833,"My Protien Bowl with carnitas exceeded all expectations for taste and price. Our waitress Renee, was very courteous and attentive. Apreciate the clean, warm welcoming setting.",5
1834,"PLEASE IF YOU ARE GOING TO CALL YOURSELF A $#$#@#$ IRISH PUB, SERVE IRISH FOOD ON MORE THAN JUST WEDNESDAYS. THANK YOU.

Also - our server did not know ANYTHING about the menu. Her exact words were, ""I don't know anything about the food, I just serve it"". All I asked was if their ravioli were made fresh or frozen, and my fiance' asked if their French fries still had the skin on them. She didn't know the answer to either question, and she didn't offer to go find out.

Thankfully, I avoided the ravioli, but my fiance' ordered the fries anyway... and they came - with skins on.

So I ordered the rib eye, rare... it came perfect. Ordered with it, a bowl of clam chowder (was home-made, yes, but under seasoned & tasted like a cream soup with clams instead of a clam chowder). I took a side of fresh fruit... what I got was 1 slice of pineapple... 2 slices of cantaloupe that were not ripe.. and 2 dried out orange slices... quite depressing.

My fiance' ordered the grilled cheese w/fries - again, fries came with skins on, so she had them sent back and asked for the fruit... she got more pineapple than I did, but her orange slices were dry, and her cantaloupe was not ripened enough.",1
1835,Excuse after excuse. Messages not returned for over a week. Impossible to get on the phone. Wasted a month with this idiot who finally decided to skate without doing the work and did not even have the courtesy to tell me. Terrible experience.,1
1836,Was going out with a friend for the night and found this place via Groupon.  Excellent burgers with a very friendly bar staff.  They also have great deals for happy hour.,5
1837,"Always clean.  Staff is great and helpful.  Usually do my own laundry, but used the laundry sevice once, and they were prompt, and my laundry was nicely folded and waiting for me when I returned.  I love this laundry!",5
1838,"I went early one morning to get a couple of boxes of coffee for a company event. The cashier was agitated by my order. She exclaimed to her coworkers that, ""it's going to be one of those days"". She proceeded to slam things around, clearly irritated that I had the nerve to place an order like that. I will get my Joe elsewhere next time.",1
1840,"If you want to walk out of a salon with impeccably threaded/shaped eyebrows, don't bother going anywhere but Indo Canada. It's quite a trek if you live anywhere but the west end, but it's easily accessible by TTC (take the 37 bus from Islington station - never the 37D or A) and you only have to maintain your brows about once a month.

Eyebrow threading costs a mere $3 and takes less than five minutes (compared to more than $20 for the same service in Yorkville). Make sure you ask for Anu, Kriti or Sonia as they do the best job and will remember your shape from visit to visit!",5
1841,"We were at Lazy Dog yesterday, the food was excellent, but the best part of the evening was our server Alejandro! He guided us through the menu and was very knowledgeable about all of our alcoholic options. Overall he was very entertaining and we will definitely come back!",5
1842,"Very professional, yet casual doctor's office. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. I have never felt so at ease in a doctor's office.",5
1843,This place is great! The service was stellar -- when I first got their I sat myself and the bartender came and took my drink order and gave me a menu. Shortly thereafter I was asked what I wanted. I want the ingredient of the jalape√±o chicken wrap but I'm a sandwich format and they did that for me no problem. I ate my dinner and the waitress brought me my check and I was out in a speedy manner (which I appreciate). The atmosphere is fun and inviting. The bathrooms are spotless/clean. The floor plan is very open and it's nice and cold inside. I will definitely be going back when I come here again for work.,5
1844,Man these guys are great. I had two carpets and a 20 year old kitchen floor that looked like total garbage and two hours later they look like brand new. Pedro did an amazing job and was extremely polite and professional. I work in the service industry myself and I'm very sensitive to what service is supposed to look like and they treated me like I would treat my customers,5
1845,"Bedbugs, horrible service, extra rent charged after I moved out with the sixty days notice, maintanice took over a month and a half to fix problems, thug looking nabors. Whatever you do don't live here!!!!!!",1
1846,"Waited a insane amount of time. Despite using the app, we waited an additional 35 minutes. My son and I got shuffled to a table along the window. Was overall good. But when a staff member opened a cupboard, I saw stacks of powdered Hollandaise sauce...?",1
1847,Madi is a consummate professional. Just ask what you want and the man delivers. He's got some great products that you can't find in your regular drug store aisle. Highly recommended.,5
1848,Bob cut my husbands hair and he did an awesome job. Great haircut and great personality. Would highly recommend,5
1849,"I am a fan of Chef Bobby Flay and was so excited to eat dinner at one of his restaurants. Mesa Grill did not disappoint, my husband and I had a FABULOUS meal. our server was excellent, he has been at the restaurant since it opened and he was extremely knowledge about the menu. everything we ate was delicious. loved the atmosphere. Bobby Flay and the Mesa Grill did not disappoint, best meal of our trip.",5
1850,"Epic has become one of the companies I depend on to keep my business running smoothly.

I've been using Epic for about 2 years, after they were referred to me by the AC company I've used for 15 years.   

Epic has never disappointed me.   They handle repairs quickly, efficiently, and cost effectively. 

 I just had them do a job repairing a leak in a cast iron kitchen drain line in an older home.   They told me that they might need to jackhammer out some of the concrete floor to get to expose enough of the pipe to do the repair because the leak was right above the floor.  They told me it would be $850, minimum.   They called me the next day, with the job complete, and news that they had been able to make the repair without jackhammering, so the total cost was only going to be $600.  Considering how hard working with cast iron can be, that's really reasonable.

 Epic plumbing does quality work, at reasonable prices.   They are available 24hrs for emergency calls, but they don't do routine repairs outside of normal business hours, which is understandable.  If you need them though, they will show up, and they'll do a good job for you.  I can't recommend Epic highly enough.",5
1851,"No Complaints with this place! Support the little guy, (last mom and pop shop)  and if you ever need anything repaired this is the place Vegas!",5
1852,"Delicious. The grilled calamari was tasty and tender. I highly recommend the penne with shrimp and scallops, Delicious rose sauce with spinach and goat chess makes it a perfect blend of flavors The blond had the Farfalle with shrimp in a garlic cream sauce, very tasty. The service is fast and friendly and the food was served hot. 
I love this place.",5
1853,"After leaving the home show, we discovered we had a flat tire. We pulled into this establishment and to our dismay, we discovered that we were going to have problems getting our tire off to change it. A sweetheart of a guy loaned us his jack and it still didn't want to come off. As Michael Lawson was leaving to go home, he saw our struggle and went out of his way to assist us. He not only tried to help change the tire but brought us some water to drink while we were waiting. THIS is one place I will be coming to again!",5
1855,Went there last night for dinner and service was so slow. The place wasn't even busy and it took over a half hour just to get our drinks. Food was OK. Then another half hour wait to get our coffees which arrived cold.  Will definitely not be returning. Better options to choose in the Maple area.,1
1861,"I was looking for a rent a motorcycle to do some touring with the last of my vacation days as the weather was turning cold in Chicago.

I had 4 criteria for the rental company:
1. I wanted an experienced rental and tour company with a good reputation.  I have heard horror stories about bad rentals on-line, particularly in AZ.
2. I wanted some place with interesting geological features.  Another downside of motorcycling in Chicago is straight, flat roads.  I wanted something interesting to ride on.
3. A place that rented exotic bikes (i.e. something other than Harleys.  Nothing against Harleys, I just wanted to try something different)
4. Something in the $100 or less/day range.  I'm an off-season tourist because I'm looking for a bargain. 

MC Tours met all of these very easily.  They were well reviewed by their past customers (on an admittedly biased ""guestbook"") and it was clear to me that they knew what was up with their very professional and knowledgeable communications.  They were answering my lists of questions I hadn't even asked yet.  

Obviously Arizona's Red Rocks area, along with the Grand Canyon and Tucson Valley make for gorgeous sight seeing, so I knew I was going to have some great destinations, but Monica and Gabor at MC Tours showed me some great roads to travel on that were as much fun as the destination.  

The Bikes at MC Tours were just what I was looking for.  I ended up getting a BMW R1200GS for 6 days, but had other more touring minded options as well as some cruisers.  Triumphs, BMWs, Kawasakis.. Lots of options.  The bikes were immaculate and Gabor gave me a great rundown on what to expect from the bike and how to operate it.  He had the kind of expertise that only comes from having ridden the bike and knowing what it will do.  He wasn't just regurgitating the manual to me.  The bikes came with a disc lock and GIGANTIC saddlebags for no extra charge and had GPS and several other options available.  I personally like the old fashioned paper maps and wasn't doing any off-roading so I skipped the GPS.  

They had a great ""Mileage saver"" option available to me since it was off-season, and even though I went over the miles per day allowance of the cheaper option, the overages still came out to be less than the more expensive unlimited mileage packages.  I certainly wasn't stressing about my mileage or watching the odometer very closely.  I managed to pack in 1200 miles with just about 5 full days of riding and still managed to save $300 over the other options.",5
1862,"Staff is friendly and helpful. They don't push you too much or anything like that, which is rare since these kinds of businesses like to push that kind of stuff. They all know how and when to help someone without being forceful. Plus this location isn't as busy as others, so it's a more calm and fun experience. My favorite location!",5

1866,Amazing carne asada burrito! Definitely going back many times.,5
1868,"In my opinion, this place has the best Chicken in the city hands down.  Ive always been a fan of KFC.  Have had Bojangles, Popeyes, Chicken Coop, Chicken Box, Chicken King, none of them compare to this chicken!  Its always nice and crispy with great flavor in every bite.  The seasoned wedges are great also.  I come here often to order chicken in bulk for events and family get togethers.  They have yet to disappoint.",5
1870,This place is amazing and I must say that Teresa was amazing on making sure my service was was good as the food. Will definitely come in again and recommend others try this place out.,5

regret that I did not go there earlier",5
1873,"First time visitor.  My wife and I frequent restaurants and we were blown away from start to finish.  The ambience was very relaxing.  The food was very well prepared and presented.  The staff was memorable.   Our server, Maleah, was so attentive and gracious. She made our visit personal and we so enjoyed her warming smile.  If your looking to get away for a quiet evening this is the place to go.  Thank you.",5

1876,"I consider myself an expert on Mexican food and all I can say is Carolinas is the BOMB!!! If not the best, one of the best Mexican joints in PHX. The bean and cheese burrito was awesome and the machaca tacos were off the hook. It's the first time I've had machaca and it is fantastic. Carolinas is a must visit Valley establishment.",5
1878,"5 Stars cause it's a nice new sportswear store on the North Shore!  As if the north shore needed another sports apparel store, right?  This is kind of like the Steelers Sidelines store you can find in Heinz Field, the Majestic Clubhouse store in PNC Park or like The Pittsburgh Fan store on Federal St.  However, this store has more options.  They have apparel, home decor and gifts for not only the Steelers and Pirates, but also the Penguins, Panthers, Dukes, Nittany Lions, Grays, Crawfords and even the Mountaineers of nearby WV.  If you're a fan of any of those teams then there's something here for you.  In my opinion, everything in these stores are well overpriced.  You can find 9 different locations in PA and over 60 stores in 9 states.  Visit Rallyhouse.com for their entire collection of items.",5
1879,"Very easy to find and very quick service! Other places told me they would have to send my jewelry out, or their jewelers don't work every day which was inconvenient for me. I called Fast-Fix and they were able to see me the same day, and my simple request was done in under 30 minutes. Great quality as well! I will return to them for any jewelry needs.",5
1881,I just recently started to bring my dog here and I could not have made a better choice. The employees are one of a kind and have a genuine interest in each dog that comes through the door. Not only is my dog getting the socialization that he needs but I don't have to worry about him being home alone all day. I know that when I drop him off in the morning he is in good hands.,5
1884,"I absolutely love this gym and could not explain in words the gratitude I have for this place and the staff. The trainers are extremely knowledgeable, very encouraging and very professional. I would have to say one of my favorite things about Mike and Matt is that they push you to go beyond your comfort zone with a positive and encouraging approach, and even better they keep YOU accountable for your success. They give you all the tools you need to accomplish your goals, and remind you that if you trust the process and be accountable for what you do outside of the gym and at home in the kitchen you will absolutely get your results. The trainers are so professional, and very informative. The training classes are amazing. They're challenging, motivating, and you learn so much from each class. They're consistently helping you  improve your form etc on specific workouts so you learn, and incorporating new things to maximize your workouts, and progress with your fitness.  I joined Revolution training to do the 6 week challenge and completed my challenge 2 weeks ago. From the beginning of the 6 week challenge to now, I've lost 7% body fat and 20lbs total! The results I have had personally have exceeded my expectations. I also would like to point out that Revolution Training is home to people in all different walks of fitness. In our group there were  people who were already in shape and wanted to get in even better shape, people who had a background in fitness/sports, but were out of shape and had some weight to lose, and others who've never worked out before and were ready to make a change. It was so amazing seeing everyone making progress and all of us feeling and seeing the change in our bodies. If you are looking for a change in your health, I highly recommend working with the Revolution Training team. Talk with them about what your goals are, and they will help you get there. These guys are extremely professional, personable, and knowledgeable. I could not have picked a better gym!!",5
1885,"Delish. If you're in the mood for burgers, hot dogs, and chili fries, this is your place. I even got the bbq chicken salad and it was great. Super fun atmosphere and music, too.",5
1889,"The atmosphere is very classy, quiet, all the waiters & Waitresses have great knowledge of the menu, drinks. You get to choose your preferred knife for your steak, all the food is cooked to perfection and tasted great. The wine selection is fantastic, the bar offers many handcrafted cocktails along with a decent craft beer selection.",5
1891,"I ordered the spicy striploin and salsa verde sandwich from here last week via Uber eats and it was so delicious. The ingredients were fresh and the flavours were amazing. I did sub out the Brie for mozzarella and they did that for me, no problem. As good as this was after a bit of a transit time I am itching to go in there and having an item or two fresh.",5
1892,"$28 for an 8oz charred steak ordered medium brought out well done, zero sauce option.One forgetful server trying to take care of the whole dining room, not the place you want to go for a steak BUT the fries were good.",1
1893,"I was pleasantly surprised on how great the burgers and fries tasted, and the price was very reasonable! This is my new burger joint!",5
1896,"Just had their salted Oreo ice cream at a pop-up shop at NoDa Brewery. Truly amazing!  Best ice cream I have had in awhile, and the flavor was perfect. Just the right amount of salty and sweet, and so creamy.  Looking forward to their shop opening!",5
1897,Part of my order was missing. There were hard inedible bits in Some of the dishes. Everything was WAY too Sweet. Large lumps of chicken fat. No balance to the flavours at all. Greatly overpriced considering the quality. This is like the Mcdonalds of Thai food. Dont bother and never trust the Just-eat rating.,1
1898,"I kept passing by this place thinking I should try it sometime so on a Saturday afternoon I finally did. I was very impressed with the variety of juices, wraps salads and acai bowls! Everything looked great. I finally settled on a protein bowl and farm green juice. Both were far better than anything I've tried elsewhere. The staff was friendly, the service was quick, and the place is clean, airy and bright. Will be coming back agaib",5
1902,These guys have helped me and my friends out on numerous occasions and no matter how busy they are they get it taken care of correctly and at a fair price.  Can't ask for anything better.,5
1903,Second visit here. It was even better than the first which I thought would be hard to beat. This place is amazing. The prices are high but definitely worth it. The service is amazing. Ask for a booth also. They are very dim and private. My second visit I had to get the pork belly for a starter again because it's delicious and melts in your mouth. For dinner I got the surf and turf with a 1/2 pound lobster tail. Easily the best tasting and quality lobster and steak I've ever had. I recommend this place if you are from out of town or even local for a fancy dinner.,5
1905,"This place was just awesome. The waitress was super nice. The food was very great. Everyone was happy with what they had. Chicken sandwich, pulled pork sandwich, and a chicken salad. Amazing nachos - they are huge! Would definitely come back here.",5
1906,"I haven't see too many pho restaurants in town delivered the pho with steaming hot broth! Love it! I ordered the lunch combo no. 3 and it was delicious. The combo came with a bowl of pho, grilled pork and appetizers, moreover, it also came with a drink and a scoop of ice cream. 

Love their warm friendly  services and always have smiles on them. 

Parking is available inside the plaza, easy to park. 

They accept VISA & MasterCard. 

Jenni~~~~Pho, you rocks!",5
1907,My gyro is always made to perfection!  The Greek salads are incredible and the staff is always polite.  The lunch combos now include a drink!  I just love this place!,5
1909,TERRIBLE service. Same issues with delivery as everyone else and zero attempts at communication. Tons of excuses without apology or solutions.,1
1910,The $3.09 plus tax ice cream dipped cone was so poorly made.  Chocolate dip was thin...and clumpy.  Customer service....wasn't even service.  Never 107th Dairy Queen,1
1911,"It's been a second time coming to this Thai massage place. First time got massage with Lin she really great and I want to come back again because of her. Second time I try to call in and want to do massage with Lin again but she not available, I give my self a chance to try with another person. I was a bit worried if it not gonna be good as same lady. But omg I was really happy that new lady (Kat) she so good!!! I'm glad that I try again. Katty was really good at massage. So amazing. I am from Thailand and I went to many massage place in Las Vegas. This place is awesome! It's real Thai massage. Love it, highly recommend!",5
1912,"Shoutout to the previous reviewers who think this is a reservation restaurant or something. It's a Dennys - it's cheap, fast and generally pretty good.

Is it the best food in the world? No, but it's pretty much what you can expect for the price in an establishment like this. Only slight complaint is the one server seemed very overworked but he managed to get the job done.

After you leave you can walk into the casino and inhale about a thousand cigarettes. It's a win win to be honest, Strip restaurants eat your heart out.",5
1915,"Street tacos were amazing and the pictures of the corn tortillas really don't do them justice, amazing and fresh",5
1917,"I have been here twice since moving back to CLE from So Cal and have been very impressed with this restaurant. The ""house"" setting feels so friendly and inviting in the cold winter months. I also hear their back patio is awesome in the warmer months, I look forward to checking that out spring 2016. 

Last night we took my dad here for his 71st b-day. Food was excellent and the service was great too. Excellent drinks, the owner is hands on ensuring quality and excellence.

Lovely place, I cannot recommend it enough!

¬°Obrigado!",5
1919,"I came to the Glendale location with my family for Father's Day and was completely disgusted. There was a spill on the floor within minutes of us being seated. We saw three servers/employees attend to the spill. They used their bare hands to wipe the floor and pick up ice, have their bare hands all over your the dirty mop bucket and mop head. This would not have been an issue if any of them would have went to wash their hands before continuing to serve drinks and food. One of these employees was even grabbing the cups by rim with her dirty hands and serving drinks to customers in them! I did bring this to the managers attention, who seemed disinterested and blew me off by say, ""don't worry"" and ""I got it right now"" as he turned away and didn't let me finish what I was saying. He then said to the employees, ""everyone wash your hand"", which no one did! Needless to say, I will not be returning or recommending this establishment to anyone! I will make the extra 20 min drive to Angry Crab where the staff is friendly and sanitary and the food is better.",1
1920,"I had the absolute best experience with Clean 'N Fresh Cleaning. I had the carpet on my stairs, 2 rugs, a sectional couch, ottoman, couch and love seat cleaned. Norma and Keith did an amazing job. They were thorough, professional, and very entertaining. It is very obvious they love what they do and are great at it. I highly recommend Clean 'N Fresh and will definitely be using them again!",5
1923,I've lived in this area for so long and finally I went. This is the best Mexican food I ever had and they are nice and polite. The carne asada was high quality. The prices were just right . it's just good. The beans had cheese in them and were great.,5
1924,"Severely understaffed. One employee for the entire restaurant and the chef in the kitchen. Went here at 3 AM, there was garbage all over the floor and all the tables. Never saw anything like it. Was told ""sit anywhere, over there maybe"". After waiting 45 minutes and not even being asked if we wanted drinks, we left.",1
1926,Service was amazing at Chapman BMW. The team is all very friendly and willing to work with your requests. Matt was awesome with helping the process flow and is a very nice man to work with. Everyone at this dealership seems to have the customer's best interest in mind. Their facilities are extremely clean. I would 100% recommend!,5
1927,Bryon is great! He will let you know if you can wait a little longer for a repair or if  needs to be fixed right away.  My entire family has purchase our water softners from Byron!,5
1928,Wonderful kind service. This acupuncture clinic really cares about their patients. They provided great customer service and provided better care than any doctors office I've been to.,5
1931,The best!!! Food is absolutely delicious!! Garlic prawns are to die for.. excellent service and definitely worth the wait. Go!!,5
1932,"I usually bring a few of my friends here every week. Me being a local from Las Vegas on a Wednesday they denied me. I was pretty disappointed and the ""manager"" who walked me out wouldn't give me his name. The security who sees me on a regular was surprise too. He told me to go to the girl on the counter and she  was nice too and she tried to get me in but wasn't successful. She told me taxi drivers get paid $85 to drop off guest here and they charge $45 at the door. I don't know what's going on with them today but the service is terrible. The worst part is that I was embarrassed in front of my friends because I wasn't taken care of. I wished I tried to go in first before they had paid. Very disappointed. Please advice.
I don't think I'll bring my friends here again.",1
1933,"I had a very good experience with a short term furnished rental. A pleasure to work with Jake and Rachel. They were very knowledgeable about the area, and it was great to work with true professionals.",5
1937,"Omg!!!! So damn delicious! We were here for breakfast and dinner. Amazingly priced well. Staff's service is so so. But that doesn't matter is you're a foodie and hungry. 

We have been to Thailand and Thai has always been our favourite cuisine. This place's dishes brought us back to our eating experiences in Thailand. 

So, do I recommend? YES!",5
1938,I just ordered some party trays for my Christmas party tomorrow and I was SO impressed by the customer service. The person on the phone was so helpful and patient with me when it came to advising what dishes I should order and how many. It was such an awesome experience. I can't wait to eat!,5
1939,"I heard Canoe was one of the best restaurants in Canada, so I just had to try it.  In addition, Canoe has a focus on regional cuisine, which draws me in like a moth to a flame.  Fortunately, I was already in Toronto :).  After actually dining there, I do hope that Canadian food catches on in Atlanta.  We already have a restaurant called Canoe, so they'll have to call it Rowboat.  Hey, a girl can dream.

Almost every seat in the house is great.  From the 54th floor of the TD Bank Tower building, you can see across the city.  What a sleek, cosmopolitan feel!  This is Toronto from its best angle.  Inside the restaurant, the decor is sophisticated and simple with a warm modern disposition.  

Canoe has a focused menu -- plenty of regional (or at least national) cheeses, seafood, interesting red meats, and seasonal veggies.  Here, the Canadian bent seems to make perfect sense and detracts from nothing.  The platings are just lovely.  One in our group had an octopus dish that was right out of Michel Bras' playbook.  I enjoyed a rather simple fish that was perfectly delicious, though I do regret not splurging for the tasting menu.  Seriously, when the chef has this much artistry and clarity, it's worth it.  Canoe's food was approachable even by those in our group with less of a fine dining focus, which speaks again to the talent and vision of the chef, Anthony Walsh.

Service was attentive and well executed, but most of all, the staff had a genuine attitude of pride towards the food they served.  It was easy to tell from their descriptions and mannerisms that they thought the food was amazing, and I'm sure that contributed to my judgement.

Yes, the food is expensive.  I'm sure the rent and ingredients are too.  At some point, when you're evaluating fine dining, it's art!  I'll always remember this dinner and hope to return for the tasting menu.

So, is Canoe the best restaurant in Canada?  It offers my favorite straight culinary experience in Toronto, with Opus being my actual favorite restaurant.  Restaurants with great views have a tendency to offer mediocure food and become tourist traps, but this is the opposite.  I highly recommend Canoe to both locals and tourists.",5
1941,I booked this hotel on Hotwire. Star rating is WRONG. Rooms are very outdated. Hotel not clean. Balcony had spider webs garbages in the lobby full. Couldn't even bear the thought of staying for a relaxing weekend there is nothing relaxing about this place. I was disappointed to say the least.,1
1943,"Recently purchased a  mattress at the stone crest location. Jim Lane was so helpful! He is very knowledgable and doesn't make you feel like he is trying to make a commission off of you. Also, he is up front about the price and any deals available. We got our mattress the next day and have had great sleep ever since!",5
1945,"I have a glass wall and ceiling sunroom by Four Seasons.  The ceiling was covered with water spots, pine straw and bird droppings.  These two guys did an absolutely fantastic job  and now I must wear sunglasses in the afternoon.

I am so pleased with the service I asked them to put me on a monthly schedule.",5
1946,"Horrible! Came here on my lunch break and had to wait over 10 minutes when there was only three cars in the drive thru (me being the 3rd car) after I finally get to the window the cashier takes my money and walks away for about 5 minutes... once I get my food I drive to the parking area to check my order. I picked up my drink, soda went everywhere because she filled the cup up way too much and my chicken strips were damn near burnt! I spoke with the manager who says ""I can give you a new cup"" A NEW CUP?!!!! I asked for my money back and offered to give the food back (untouched) and he says ""we're aren't going to do that"" horrible service, horrible ""manager"", just a horrible fast food restaurant. Don't waste your money here!",1
1947,"This was my first time ever buying a car by myself, and I am more than pleased with my decision to purchase from them.  I had checked out 5 other dealerships across the valley, and I was ready to throw in the towel.  I heard one of my peers talking about how she just bought a car and how it was so easy.  I asked her where she went and she sent me here.  From the second I arrived the staff was great!  Rodney helped me find my perfect car and let me take full control.  He didn't make me feel rushed into making a decision, which I feel like every other dealer I went to did.  Jeff, the finance manager, helped me by answering every question I had.  He even printed out a loan payment explanation when I was confused about my loan I was getting through my personal bank!  I am more than grateful for how easy they made my first car buying experience.   From here on, I will only be buying my cars from them!",5
1948,"They never disappoint me here! We haven't had a bad experience or a moment of disappointment. Hospitality is quick, and very accommodating. Love the concierge service, every one seems to want to serve you, nice quality to have today. 

We got to stay in the penthouse this trip & just love love love it! 

Happy owner with Monarch now switching over to Diamond - I'm ok with it!",5
1950,"I have been a member for about a year now.  I have wasted few $$$ in the beginning in finding the right therapist for me. I had to go through 4 therapist before finding AC. 
In massage... its either you have the touch or you don't, and AC definitely has it. 

AC is always fully booked, you will have to make an appointment in advance. 

This place is newly renovated too. Lobby got a lot smaller but they add a private waiting room inside.",5
1951,Great place!  They were fast and did a great job on my sons hair. They only take cash so make sure you are prepared.,5
1954,"My buddy and I decided to go on a food adventure and try this new place....great pick by me :)

I saw them on Instagram and was soon a big fan of everything they do.  They make their own buns, sauces, compotes, everything.

It's a nice little place that has been decorated nicely yet simple.  The one thing i picked up right away was their marketing.  Everything was marketed very well right down to the name itself; Toma Burger Addiction....addiction it was lol  The prominent words on the front cover of their menu were: Burger, Addiction, Delicious....see what I mean by how they market? 

We were greeted by probably one of the best servers I have had in awhile.  She's a girl from France who moved to Toronto in April, well she is definitely a hard working girl who has a good eye....keep her Toma! She's the type who will give you more water without you asking and always smiling.

We ordered the Wild Life and Monster burgers with truffle fries and a roasted garlic aioli....just writing that out made me drool for more of their food....I am such a fat kid.

Anyways everything was peeeeeerfect!  my friend even mentioned that the structure of the whole burger was intact throughout the whole meal....i nicknamed him ""The Architect of Burgers"".  It was not messy, sloppy or anything...well engineered burger.

We will 1111000000% come back here many times and i am just going to say this is one of the best burgers i have had in the city....so go get some of it now!

Well down guys keep it up!!",5

When iam doing a project , I want quality lumber,salespeople that can answered all my questions and make the right choices in estimating and selecting materials .Confidence in knowing I can get  help with any construction issues makes Brookside a 5 star company .",5
1959,"My Hubby and I enjoyed ourselves immensely here, the food was delicious and arrived timely but the best part of our experience was our server Rochelle. She is very professional and friendly and did everything quickly with a smile on her face, not to mentioned she made sure by husband's drink was never empty! We will definitely be back not just for the food but for Rochelle too!!!",5
1960,"ATMOSPHERE

Walking in, there were pastries and coffee at the front and seats in the back for a sit down meal. We got there quite late, circa 245 pm, and found that there was still a 45 minute wait. This cozy little spot is notorious for a wait, but it was well worth it. 

FOOD 

The only disappointing thing was how much had sold out by then! All the cold sandwiches I wanted to try were out. Alas, I took a deep breath and decided upon having a chicken kale caesar salad. Boy was it tasty! And THAT BREAD. So delish. Next time I'm in, I'd like to make it earlier to try one of the sandwiches. And if you don't have the luxury of time, do yourself a solid and get a croissant and/or a few pastries for the road.

OVERALL

Coming back the next time I'm in town. Such a cute spot and I'm determined to get a sandwich next time around!",5
1962,"Looked over many reviews and saw this restaurant had many good reviews.  I wanted to have a special dinner for my wife and I to celebrate our 20th anniversary and took a chance on this place.  Worked out better than I hoped.  Great atmosphere and fantastic service.  Our waiter Vince was the best I have ever encountered.  He was very good at advising us on the menu and he was right on the mark.  My steak was a filet on the bone and was perfect.  The sauces they give you are both fantastic and the balsamic butter on the steak alone would have made it the best steak I have had in along time.  My wife had the bolognese sauce and loved it.  We bought a bottle of wine as it is a better deal than by the glass.

The bottom line if you are looking to splurge on a great dinner in Vegas I would go to Stacks every time!

 By the way you can't go wrong with a place that serves ""Adult Tater Tots!""",5
1964,"Bedbugs and roaches at the 2744 Hampshire Rd. Building. We know that we absolutely did not bring them in. No parking. Fire escape is a nightmare; be very careful, as one of the steps collapsed when we were moving in. Office staff is difficult to deal with; maintenance staff are prompt and helpful. When they offered to extend our lease another year, they raised the rent price $15. Fair enough, but when we turned them down they advertised our original rental price to new tenants. Building is showing its age; fuses in the kitchen blew regularly. Do not recommend.",1
1969,They forgot my order and would not refund my money when I called. Then I went online to fill out the survey and it said someone would contact me and nobody has. Really bad device even for a crapy McD's,1
1970,Love this place. Great food and we have never had a bad waiter or waitress. Today we have a very nice waitress her name is Jamie.  Awesome job!!!,5
1971,I was able to get right in and I had an incredible experience with Angeleta.  When I thought my haircut was done she brought out the shaving supplies to clean up some some areas and also gave me a warm towel and a massage.  I have been cutting my own hair for a couple years and I am kicking myself for doing so after this.  I bet the place fills up during peak hours so make sure you plan ahead.,5
1972,"Save yourself the terrible service, overpriced food, and awful experience, and go somewhere else. Definitely not worth it, especially if there is a wait. 

After waiting nearly an hour to get our food after we placed our order, our food came out. I would have been willing to give this place 2 or 3 stars if the food was at least half decent, but it wasn't. Our burgers were extremely dry, the chicken satay wraps were tasteless and cold, and my sister's fries were dry and stale. I was hoping that after the long wait, at least our food would be good, but it seemed like it had just been sitting out forever. 

Frozen Hot Chocolate: 
My best advice would be to skip their frozen hot chocolate and instead, go to Godiva and get their frozen Dark Chocolate Decadence shake. It tastes better and costs less than half the price. We got the frozen hot chocolate to go because we wanted to get out of the place. The frozen hot chocolate is good, but definitely not worth $11. Each of us took a few sips and that was all we needed before throwing it away. And trust me, it was not because we were full. 

This was the closest I have ever come to walking out of a restaurant. Our server, Robert or something like that, was probably one of the worst servers I have ever had. My entire family works or has worked in the restaurant/service industry so we usually give servers the benefit of the doubt, but this guy was unacceptable even to our standards. He gave us a bunch of attitude and was not attentive at all. At one point, it was taking so long for our food to come out that my mom asked him to cancel our order. But he told us, ""Oh, but it's right there, I can see it"". I had a direct view of the kitchen and there was nothing on the counter... but we decided to be nice and say ok. Fast forward 15 minutes later... still no food. He intentionally avoided our table during that entire time and was not apologetic at all. I think he may have said sorry once but it was the least genuine and most condescending ""sorry"" I have ever heard. 

To end on a happy note, the decor is really cute. Reminds me of an old school ice cream shop.",1
1973,"We spent about 90 percent of the show trying to figure out how the stage was moving, where the props we're going, how they could dive from such a height into such a tiny space... So much going on at every second, well worth the wait, and a beautiful way to experience Vegas! 

Make time for this one!",5
1974,"This is one of my absolute favorite places to eat in Charlotte.

I am not adventurous when it comes to food, but I tried several of their signature hot dogs and they were all amazing.

Their cheese fries are delicious. 

I recently became vegetarian and thought that I could no longer eat here, but it turns out JJ's has an option for veggie dogs!!!  Now I love this restaurant even more for having a vegetarian option!!!",5
1975,i ordered two simple cake donuts. What I received was two week? old clumps of dough. Going to Frys for my pastries. They are fresh baked.,1
1976,"The best thing about this place is its location inside the enclosed mall.  While eating my crappy lunch -- I'll get to that in a moment -- I was sitting in their 'cafe'.  The ceiling of the mall has a sky motif; suddenly I heard thunder, the sky turned a bit dark (remember, this is inside the mall) and it started to rain. Drops of water fell from the ceiling into a pool below.  It truly simulated a spring shower.

Cool.  But I came for the food.  And that was awful.

I ordered beef with broccoli.  To quote Clara Peller -- remember her? -- ""where's the beef?""  I got over-priced broccoli, with a side of tasteless over-cooked noodles.

Unfortunately, some restauranteurs in touristy areas, don't care about client retention since their customer-base is transient. I hope reviews like this, spark the owners to upgrade their standards.  I for one, won't be back.",1
1977,"The cilantro jalape√±o hummus was worth the trip. Gyro was STUFFED with meat and very tasty. Kind of in a sketchy neighborhood, but the food was delicious and reasonably priced.",5
1980,"Do not recommend

Food is a terrible vegetarian alternative

Waiting time is excessive 
Go somewhere else",1
1981,"I will NEVER visit this Pearle Vision again or any Pearle Vision of that matter. I was conned out of my money and charged for a bunch of things I didn't ask for. Being young and black, they saw that as an opportunity to take advantage of someone that is just trying to take the initiative to be on top of their health. The glasses I've gotten were not a good investment. They smudge easily, there's no evidence of the UV protection and ""Reflection"" frames, the list goes on. Do yourself a favor. Go elsewhere.",1
1985,"MY HOME GYM!!!!

Ofcourse I'm biased to everything that's up with this place.

2 squat racks only though. The testosterone levels in the weight area increases during rush hours at 5PM and the battle begins towards the racks! HEY BRO, HOW MANY SETS LEFT?
(Turns around) 100 MILLION 55, FACK YOU when my preworkout cease to exist, K?

JOKING ASIDE, everyone is friendly as long as you don't hog any of the machines, you wipe em after every use, say please and thanks and spot whoever asks for your assistance and not the ones YOU THINK needs it! Life lesson for you today. I've seen many bruised egos expose muscle men to thinking they're not BIG ENOUGH because Larry from spinning class decides to spot you on your first rep, WHAT DAISY DUKE? THIS IS MY WARM UP!!

Great staff and positive vibes! 2 HR PARKING LIMIT  so word of advice : The walk is about 5 mins to and from parking so plan your strategy wisely or you pay $3.50 if you go over by even a second and the 'parking lot guys' can only take my eyelash batting ways about 5 times before they figured I was being cheap. So don't be me! 

Happy work outs world!",5
1988,"We really like this place!  A lot of the portions are small, typical for this kind of fine dining place, but my favorite dish (barbequed chicken on a bed of fries) is humongous and good for two people.  Love the churro/milkshake dessert, too.  My parents are terrific food snobs and they like this place a lot.",5
1990,"Terrible price for the location. I recommend that you look at Palladium or the Stetson as you will get a much better place for the same price or less. When I moved out, they charged me $700. My place was immaculate when I moved out as I am not a pet owner. 

They also run out of Guest parking passes the first couple of weeks and if you don't go in to get the current months pass, your friends car will get towed! 

Look anywhere within a mile radius of this place and you will be getting a better deal.",1
1992,The absolute best in customer service AND reasonable prices. Sarah came to my rescue when I broke the LCD on my Samsung for the 2nd time in six months. She gave me a loaner screen while my new one came in (took a day) and was just generally a joy to do business with. I'm a fan!,5
1994,"Wow! This theatre has redefined a night out at the movies. They've taken everything we dislike about most movie theatres and replaced it with a new way to cater to America's favorite obsession. Here are some examples (but you've gotta experience this for yourself to fully appreciate it):

Typical theatre: Get to the movie early so you can beat the crowds and find a good seat. 
Esplanade 14: Choose your seat beforehand (all seats same price)

Typical theatre: stand in line at the concession stand and give up a better seat or part of your movie and expect major price gouging. 
Esplanade 14: pay reasonably priced concessions from the comfort of your seat with the help of a server (included). 

Typical theatre: small, dirty/sticky, cloth seats with little leg room
Esplanade 14: big plush leather seats with a fold out table with so much leg room you should never touch the seat in front of you. And they were thinking large Americans here- No problems for the 300+ pounders. They won't be spilling over into the seat next to them.  These seats rock!...literally 

Typical theatre: various popcorn sizes and drink sizes all rediculously priced. 
Esplanade 14: one popcorn size 7.50 (free refills and large enough to feed anyone), one drink size (large with free refills). Not a rip off either. 

Typical theatre: $10-$11
Esplanade 14: $13 and probably should cost more. 

Only one negative thing to say:
I don't like the extra butter for my popcorn on the side in a small plastic cup. I don't know how to put it on like the specially trained concessions staff and it's difficult in the dark. The theatre should complete the preparation of the popcorn before it reaches your seat.",5
1995,"Great for large groups! I was looking for a restaurant in Vegas where I could celebrate a birthday party for about 15 people. Boy am I glad I chose Canaletto! They seated us upstairs in a gorgeous private room! We got our own private waiter, Mauricio, who was wonderful. It was a very private room with a gorgeous view and the food was wonderful. My only complaint was that it was pricey- especially the house wine was $37 a bottle! Yikes. Still worth it, but be ready to spend a pretty penny.",5
1998,"Ok, this place HAS to be officially closed. It's my second time trying to come here and it's locked up.",1
1999,"I went there last night for the first time and I must say that I was very surprised to see that  it wasn't way busier. I lived in South Korea twice and have eaten at countless old restaurants while I was there, and this place reminded me of those places. The layout wasn't as authentic as I expected, but they still had the grill at the table and the food was spot on. I'll definitely be going back!!",5
2003,"My friends and I decided to go see this show spur of the moment and we were not disappointed! This is show definitely a WOW!!! It's a great show for all ages.
This theater seats are in a semi circle which helps view the show. There is water as part of the show so some of the side theater seats may get viewers wet.
Visually the stage scenes are beautiful in pictures & video. The scenes and video are very colorful and vivid! This adds to the shows acts and  at times they are holographic & life like.
The actors are extremely talented.Some acts are nail biting. The music was very good and some acts were very artistic and beautifully presented. The people in the show are amazing & what they can do with there bodies is awe inspiring! 
I highly recommend seeing this show! 
The acts are extremely entertaining creative & exciting.You will be saying WOW!!!",5
2004,"I bought my two F5 Savannah kittens, brother and sister, from here. They are the joy of my life right now. Very friendly, very inquisitive, aren't afraid of much, and well socialized. I've kept up with the breeder and she's very helpful at answering questions that arise. Worth looking into if this is what you're interested in.",5
2005,Best beer spot in Toronto.  Plus local-ish food.  Small room so get here early or late.  Excellent!!!,5
2006,"First time, and never again. I take partial responsibility for my crappy experience. I should have looked up the reviews on this nail salon before walking in, and once I was in the chair, I should have trusted my gut and ran instead of worrying about being rude. 

This nail salon is inside Great Lakes Mall, near the Sears store.  The salon was fairly busy and looked popular.  I went in for a simple gel french manicure, which I have had multiple times at other salons. I was quoted $35 for this service before agreeing to it, picked out my pink nude base, and took the first available technician.  The first bad sign I should not have ignored was the dust; there was nail powder and dust coating the floor, tables, chairs, tools, EVERYTHING, and it was even on my black pants and I had been in the salon for less than 5 minutes. 

I had two simple and polite requests before the manicure started. One - I did not want my nails to be over filed, and two - I did not want the white part of the french design to be thick. The part where I should have walked out is when I noticed the nail files and buffing blocks had been used previously on other clients. Its gross, other people's nail dust and germs are all in the files as they grind down your nails.  I should have said something. I should have requested new tools. I was embarrassed, I am not good at being confrontational or speaking up and looking rude. But also, in a ""professional"" salon, I shouldn't have to ask them to use clean tools. So I sat there, skeeved out over it. 

When I was told I could wash my hands I scrubbed them down good. The nail technician hardly talked to me, which made it awkward. He kept talking to the other people working in the salon in another language. I think the only small talk we made was that he told me to take biotin for my thin nails. The part that really made me mad was that he ignored my request about the white tips not being thick. I politely asked him to make them thinner, and he tried to talk me out of it. That is fine and all, I heard his point, but then I requested it my way anyways because I am the one paying and it is my fingers I have to look at. He then proceeded to roll his eyes at me and fix it in a very rushed manner, because apparently I was taking up too much of his precious time. When he was done, he didn't even ask me if I liked the way he had fixed it. He looked annoyed as I inspected my hand to make sure I liked it before I stuck my hand under the curing lamp. That is where his tip went down a bit. I am a paying customer, a polite one at that who is not sitting down for the cheapest gel manicure around...sorry, not sorry? Oh, and my nails were totally being over filed the whole time. I had medium length nails and left with nicely shaped stubs. I had to kind of pull my hand away while he was filing to make him stop it. Very aggravating.

They put this disgusting lotion on you afterwards with a hand massage. I am still trying to clean the disgusting dried up lotion out of my diamond ring. Not even a warning he was going to do it so I could have taken to ring off.

The icing on the cake was when I noticed a bottle of windex next to the stations. I have a suspicion that is what they are ""cleaning"" the tools with. I couldn't help but feel very, very skeevy looking at that bottle. Lets just say it obviously wasn't there to clean the manicure tables, because the place was a mess. Again, no proof, just a suspicion of my own. 

I paid and left as soon as I could. I have no intentions of EVER returning, nor will I ever recommend them to anyone. Oh, and in case you were wondering, my $35 french manicure suddenly cost more after the service. The tip has to be in cash, and they expect a full tip. The manicure I got is not worth what I paid. It is awful to leave a nail salon thinking ""I can't wait to get to a sink so I can scrub my hands, arms, and bath them in purell.""

I know this is long, but I hope this review helps you",1
2009,"My first time there over the weekend. Quick service and really good food. They forgot part of our food but once we mentioned it, they brought it immediately.",5
2010,really good beer! usually most breweries I try there's only very few I like but we tried 3 different flights and I liked most of them surprisingly. I did have my favorites like the oatchata milk shake and the export stout was amazing! will definitely be coming here again... and again! our bartender Jesse that day was awesome he's really nice and gave us a free taster! thanks Jesse.,5
2012,"My favorite Artisan ice cream place. I love all their seasonal ice creams and regular ones. They just have such interesting combinations. But my favorite is not ice cream it's their Riesling pear sorbet. It is so good! It's sweet with just a bit of tartness. Even though the prices here can be on the high side, it's definitely worth the price. The ambiance is very causal and chill. It's in the middle of downtown Chagrin Falls so it's one of my favorite spots for a date.",5
2013,"Used to be a decent buffet. Not anymore. No selection at all. Meats are horrible. No taste at all. The best thing was the cheese, however it was not something they prepared. No selection of prepared dishes. Very disappointed. Never coming back .",1
2015,"I've submitted this same complaint on McDonalds website, but I feel that others need to know about my experience there. 
My breakfast this morning was so nasty, I spit it out. My coffee was absolutely undrinkable (I couldn't keep it in my mouth long enough to determine what was wrong). My egg and cheese biscuit tasted like cleaner and plastic chemicals. It was absolutely the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted. 
I honestly don't know why we continue to go to this location. It used to be good, but every time we go now, it's subpar.",1
2016,"This is the type of place where the baristas know your name, your favourite drinks and the time you'll come around. The food is much better than starbucks in terms of nutrition and variety and the coffee tastes fresh. The vibe is old and indie- it's usually busy. Definitely recommend, and I've introduced numerous friends to this cafe.",5
2017,Love love love this place! Guava Pastelitos are delicious! Cakes are amazing too. Grab fresh Cuban bread on the weekends.,5
2018,"Great drip coffee and great quick breakfast bagel sandwiches.  It reminds me of NY, down to the staff.  Definitely one of he better breakfast spots in the area.

Has couches and tvs in case you need to catch up on your morning news.",5
2019,"Very impressed with Kyle's work- was able to fix my bathtub faucet when I had already been told it could only be fixed by going through a wall.
I had let it go for too long and then was in a panic- but he put forth the effort to come on short notice and fit me in- and I know his schedule was busy! Much Appreciated!  I agree with the other reviews in that he is very reasonably priced, as well.  Will definitely call Kyle for future repairs!",5
2021,"Outstanding experience! The owners are beyond nice and really went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of! Rented for two hours tonight and had a blast! Their pricing is great, will be back for sure next time we are in town. Thank you both for running a great business.",5
2025,"Great food and great service! We had Kyle as a server, he came over and checked how everything tasted, refilled drinks promptly, and even got our bill ready at the perfect time. There are many more items on the menu that I want to come back to try!!",5
2027,"This place is home away from ""Sweet Home Chicago"". Seriously, if you didn't go outside and feel the desert heat you would think you were in a typical Chicago style fast food joint.

I've had most everything here except the pizza and I can tell you it's all the real deal. Hot dogs, beef, Italian sausage, polish, and gyros. It's all just as good as you'd get back in Chi town.

My favorite meal here is the gyros sandwich and I'm a real stickler on this. There are several places to get gyros here in the valley, but if you want the real deal Chicago style gyros this place has it and does it right. They use real shaved off the spit gyro meat on a lightly grilled pita with onions, tomato, and tzatziki sauce- and that's it! No lettuce, olives, feta cheese, weird herbs, or funky dressings like some other places serve it. At last I've found a decent gyro in Vegas!

Also, nice people working there. Good service, Chicago sports on the TVs, and plenty of pictures and memorabilia on the walls to make you homesick.

I only wish they were closer to my house.",5
2029,"Do not stay here and expect your things to be safe.  We had our iPad stolen out of the room safe and they will not do anything about it.  The worst customer service I have ever dealt with.  We were treated like liars.  I would expect this from a 2 star hotel but not the Bellagio.  

Update:  
Contacted customer service after Lori P. of the Bellagio told me to and yet again a horrible experience.  They are refusing to do anything about our stolen iPad that was stolen on their property by their own staff.  Really, Bellagio...you are a joke of a company when you don't even stand behind your employees that you hired...not me.  I lost more money in your casino than the cost of an iPad but it's the principle of the matter.  You took my iPad from the room safe that you provided as a safe place for my belongings and I want it back.  The saddest part of this whole ordeal is that no one has even offered an apology.  They just keep passing the problem to someone else.  I can't tell you how much time I have wasted on the phone talking to these inconsiderate people.  As a doctor, I don't have a lot of free time to spend on hold waiting for the next person and the next person...  I guess they are too busy counting the billions of dollars they made last year to deal with my petty issue.",1
2030,"The Chrome Toaster was one of the food trucks at the Beer Me Brew Fest.  When I saw the silver-painted old school bus, I knew I had to try this one. 

The menu is written on the glass of the bus door.  I saw Philly and knew this was my order for the day.  Added an order of fries with this.

As I said with my tip, both the sandwich and the fries were amazing.  First the fries.  These are not ordinary french fries.,  These are roasted fingerling potatoes cut up in spears or the smaller ones left whole and seasoned with herbs and other seasonings.  Best ""fries"" I have ever tasted!

The Philly was served on a kaiser roll and was stuffed!  The roll itself tasted like it was homemade.  It was light and had more of the texture of a croissant.  The meat was sliced beef.  Caramelized onions, mushrooms and cheese were mixed in with the meat and watercress added on top.   Absolutely amazing.

It's funny that I have been searching for a long time for the best Philly cheesesteaks in Charlotte and now my two favorites come from food trucks.  

In fact, The Chrome Toaster, just took over the #2 spot in my favorite food trucks list in Charlotte.  Don't let the bus fool you, this is for real!!!!",5
2032,"I cannot believe some of the posts regarding South Hills Movers. Must be disgruntled former employees or those looking for something for nothing. We have used SHM on 3 separate occasions for long range moves and have been totally satisfied with both the movers and the administration staff. We have had no surprises and they have always delivered on commitments exactly as promised. If we had questions they responded immediately. If we suggested any changes or modifications they could not have been any more supportive. Our last move from Pittsburgh to Florida back in May included moving 280 boxes and 16,000 plus pounds of household goods. All was professionally packed by SHM and we had only two glass related items broken. My wife broke one and I broke the other. We had 4 folks pack and 3 involved in the delivery to our new home. They arrived 5 minutes early and worked their butts off the entire time they were here. I had used other moving companies earlier in my career. I can honestly say that South Hills Movers were the best we have ever dealt with and no one is paying me to say this. I would be happy to answer any questions any potential customer may have.  Paul",5
2036,"On a referral from a friend of mine, I called green ninja. They did exactly what my buddy told me they would do, a very thorough job spraying for bugs and they even got rid of an ongoing ant problem I was having in my backyard. Charlie, apparently one of the owners, was a cool dude to talk to as we cased my backyard too. Very knowledgable and personable. Will definitely them to my friends.",5
2039,We bought the groupon for two people and half hour open bar and had an awesome time! The drinks were strong and the bartender was very funny and entertaining,5
2043,"If I could give more stars I would.  Rachel was amazing!!!! Everyone is so friendly and always so polite. I moved here couple months ago and when you move to a new state and town its so dreading and scary of not knowing who is good or not, So Happy to finally find a place where I know ill always leave feeling more beautiful Rachel was AWESOME!!!! And the whole team seems wonderful too. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who has doubts, I go off reviews and recommendations as well.  Enjoy! :)",5
2045,The target pharmacy is now partnered CVS. The pharmacist Abby is amazing. I had an unexpected health issue and was very distraught about having to stop breastfeeding due to the medication. Bawling my eyes out Abby reassured me I would be okay and could still breastfeed. She was very nice and explained everything to me. I highly recommend this pharmacy. They care about their patrons. Thank you Abby and target!,5
2046,"This is an updated review.

I don't know what the change is from our previous purchase.. something has changed at this dealer...we are onto our second Cadillac and we're about to purchase our third..a car off the lot, only upgrade was to be tinted windows. 

We put 10 K down on a 2018 ATS...a car that was either sold or really didn't exist... but either way was supposed to be at the dealership within days of the deal and payment.

The first excuse was the weather.. stuck on a rail car in Ohio snowbound. Then as days past and turned into a week or so it was a shortage of rail cars.. and it hadn't moved..

The only contact was the contact I made.. they were not proactive and in no way did they make an effort to resolve the issue. My frustration grew and I expressed that to both the salesman and the GSM.

The last excuse was Cadillac was having delivery issues. 

Finally I called one last time to speak to the GSM, yet again. He had no idea who I was.. I had to remind him and about the situation... he said he would have an update in 48-72 hours. Not acceptable.  It was not a special order. 

Then we got a letter in the mail thanking us for our purchase.. asking how we were enjoying the car and to please refer people... really? Do you have a clue about customer service?

The salesman Bruce Kline and the GSM Scott Trumbley were pretty much useless. 

Needless to say I canceled the purchase and requested my down payment be returned immediately. 

Cadillac is getting a letter. The Cadillac we own will be our last. We will NOT be using Findlay for servicing of the current car.",1
2047,Really good company to work with! They always have fresh ideas and they come up with unique ways of getting your message noticed! I highly recommend using them!,5
2048,"My go to for local authentic Chinese food.  It's cheap and fast and portion sizes are quite reasonable.  It's not by any means a glamorous place, but it's a great option if you don't want to cook or splurge on anything fancy.

Tip:  They charge 5 cents for a take out container if you don't finish your dine-in food.",5
2049,Wings rock!!  I dig the VooDoo sauce.  Big wings and friendly staff.  My son and both love the place.,5
2050,Went in for Sunday bloody Mary's our bar tender was Bethany (super hot just saying) she nailed the Bloody Mary I was only going for one then 3 later I was ready to marry this girl she just nailed it. 10/10 would come again but only if I knew she was here mixing my drinks. Plus not really bar review but girls with short hair do it for me haha,5
2051,"Extremely slow service for a busy little place. Watch out!! Lunch specials recently went up to $9.29 each. Used to be $6.99! 
Salad is underwhelming and maki rolls are slapped together. Their quality has dropped compared to 3 years ago. Staff are extremely rude. Will be looking for a new sushi joint ... send me recommendations!",1
2052,"I'm used to come to this place for a man cut..everytime the service is perfect.
place clean, quiet and service fast and accurate.
I strongly reccomend it.",5
2054,"Our friends took us here during a recent weekend trip in Montreal. Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. Amazing taste and cooked to perfection. The fries and salad were good too, but you really go here for the burgers. They have a huge menu of different types, although I had the classic burger with a few basic toppings and wasn't disappointed. Highly recommended.",5
2056,"I really like this place. From the chilled adult beverage menu to the dessert menu Justin Beckett has put together an impressive and challenging array of culinary delights for your dining pleasure. 
We've only been here a few times, but BT is fast becoming a favorite. 
Hot tip: Get the deviled egg of the day. Yesterday was the eggplant Parmesan. Complete with a tiny (but tasty) parmesan chip about the size of a dime. These things are little single bites of tastebuds joy. 
We also had the roasted beet appetizer. This dish was more than enough for the three of us dining. 
The entr√©es for the evening were the roasted chicken (delicious), ribs (moist, tender & tasty) and the flattop seared cheese burger (pretty good, but I'll try something else next time). 
The drink menu offers some really tasty concoctions too. If you like a Sazerac, try the Legend City. If you're a native, you'll appreciate the nod to the amusement park. Bring a Ladmo Bag!",5
2057,"I wouldn't call myself a sushi master, but I eat A LOT of sushi. I even ventured to make sushi. Although I don't see sushi chef in my future. This place. IS AMAZING. The price is reasonable. The service is amazing! They give you a  free ice cream scoop!

The food is always fresh.

Definitely one of the best sushi place (if not so, atleast for the price range) in Toronto.",5
2058,"Super tasty, has definitely taken over my past favourites of Khao San Road or Sabai Sabai. Suhko Thai is the only other restaurant that compares in taste. 

It's super busy all the time, but the food is definitely worth it.",5
2059,"I went to tire kingdom to have an emissions check done. They turned around and told me that I needed to do a bunch of work to get it up to pass testing. ""I don't need all that work I just need to pass my emissions test."" Their response: ""well if you want to pass the test, you have to get the work done."" I got angry, picked up my vehicle, took it to a local inspection center by where I live and got it done cheaply and efficiently with no mention of any of the bullcrap tire kingdom was telling me to do.

While I was waiting in their waiting room, I saw them telling some lady that she needed thousands of dollars of work that she probably didn't need.She was really upset, called her husband and trying to figure out what bills they would have to pay late to get this work done. 

The business model seems to be all about screwing people over.",1
2060,"They lost me as a listener when they ditched Chuck & Vincent's ""Morning Ritual"" several months ago (and apparently lots of other listeners, too.) That Adam Corolla guy is boring as hell. And they replay ""Best Of"" on the weekends, so no escaping him any mornings. Their musical repertoire is seriously on auto-pilot...the same predictable Red Hot Chili Pepper and Sublime and Foo Fighters songs over and over again. Boring. (And, no, why would I get Sirius/XM to hear the same boring alt crap I can hear for free?) Any time there's a new song, I never hear it ever again. Everything The Edge 103.9 should be playing, Jonathon L already gets to months in advance (*years* in advance, in some cases) on his Lopsided World of L across the dial.",1
2066,First time going there and it was awesome. The people are really nice and the coffee is simply delicious. Customer service is at its best! Wish we had one of these in LA!,5
2067,"This is the best business in the valley, I have used them three times to move my bikes to or from one shop or another. Very professional, honest, nice, and squared away. Never had to worry about anything.",5
2068,"If you're going to Encore or leaving... you MUST swing by this place to grab some bomb cheap tacos!! It's literally one block away. Nothing fancy, just some delicious authentic tacos. You walk in, and there's signs directly telling you which line to place your orders for specific taco's or other items you wish on the menu. It's an open view kitchen where you could see all the love that is going into it while seeing and smelling the meats being stewed or grilled which is pretty cool. After you place your order, you bring it over to a separate cashier counter to pay... And that's where you may ask for a cup for free refills on whatever beverage you please for the Vegas hot weathers. They have some pretty unique Mexican fountain drink options such as mango juice, horchata, creamy orange drink, some sort of chrysanthemum or jasmine lemon ice tea, etc. 

THE FOOD -- the two absolute must is the lengua (beef tongue) and the adobada (spicy pork).
Lengua - for some of you who gets intimidated of eating something like tongue... Well, don't be. I'm not one who ever likes to eat tongue or those sort of things besides two exception.. Now 3 (Blue Ribbon, Tacos El Bronco, now hello Tacos El Gordo). It literally just looks like ordinary chunks of beef... And it totally blows my usual NYC's fave taco spot's lengua taco. It's not as mushy but yet it's still tender.
Adobada - the spicy pork was flavorful along with the fresh topping and verde sauce. It wasn't too spicy too which is a plus for me since I'm a baby when it comes to spice.

The line wasn't long to order at all and I was able to grab a table right away. This place seriously is generous and stuffs the hell out of your tacos and the shell of the tortilla is so well made!",5
2069,I went there two weeks ago and dropped $4000.00 on new equipment. The sales person was very patient and knowledgeable on the products I purchased. I have mobility issues and the salesman was kind enough to load the gear into my car.,5
2070,"I can not say enough good thing about Dr. mathews and his staff.

First on his professional skills, experience and knowledge, all are the first class, in my opinion.  But most importantly, his attitude toward patient.

I have a case that is traditionally treat one way, by text book, but it is lengthily, painful and costly.  After discuss with doc, he provided the solution only like I am his family member.  The solution is easy and cost much less.  While I was in the treatment, the temporary partial fell off.  He came back on the holiday from his trip to take care the emergency (it is emergency to me).

I say thank you to Dr. Mathews and will recommend Dr. Mathews to everyone.",5
2071,"I chose this company because all my neighbors recommended them. I'm extremely happy I did, total professionals. I highly recommend them to everyone!",5
2072,"Legit and authentic. 

I think I've tried them all (the pasties) and there were only 2 I didn't care for. My go to traditional pasty is the bangers and mash and when I feel like a little spice in my life I go with the Carne Adovada. If you really want to mix it up, try the chicken greek or the salmon.

Their soups are amazing. It took me awhile before I ever ordered soup at this place and now I never don't get at least a cup, even when its 110 degrees outside. The red pepper/chicken is where I started but now I can't get away from the cream of leak. I wasn't even sure what leaks were before I tried it and now I can't get enough. It has a certain addictive quality.

I also like the added apps and sides. 

Love the bar. Service is good but has a strong hipster presence. 

If you can handle tattoos and piercings along with great food and a nice beer selection this is must to check out.",5
2073,Thank you global chiropractic for all your help in my recovery for getting me better greatest people in the world thank you dr. cam dr. steven and chelsea and staff most kindest people in the world god bless you all to you and your families,5

I would highly recommend PV for all your jewelry replacement/repair needs :)",5
2075,"First time customer. Will never be coming back. Double booked appointments, long wait times, not enough seating for all of the people here (am one of four people standing around), unprofessional and unfriendly staff who can't even return a smile.

2076,"very friendly, quick n efficient, clean n family friendly

I need to update my earlier review be very careful when going here as far as your insurance We now have over $1,000 in medical bills because the urgent cares contracts were not signed at the time of the service when calling their billing dept was advised that the receptionists don't have that information So Be Very Careful before going to these clinics still trying to see what can be done",1
2078,"Omg I can not get enough of this place. Everytime I come to Vegas I must visit this taco place. They have the absolute best tacos, bowls and burritos ever. I have been to many taco place but this one is the best!! The have amazing flavoring and seasoned to perfection. The ladies are so great and very friendly. The owners are sisters and have a few other locations. They're restaurant is a cute little spot with an upstairs. It's a very cut setting. It's a must try if your in Vegas!!! You won't regret it!!",5
2079,"I give this a rating of zero for the head doctor in charge, Dr. Nichols and this is the only reason for the low rating.  The ladies at the front desk and the nurses are caring and wonderful. And I received good care in previous years with Ms.Vierra but she is no longer at this practice.  I also received 5 star dietary care with the dietician onsite, Mr. Valenzuela and he is still there.  If you need help with weight loss, this is the place.  

The new assistant, Whitmore is very nice but he is working under Dr. Nichols and I have found the level of care to be slipping.  I was in alot of discomfort and it took me more than 3 weeks of trying over the counter meds to get antibiotics for a serious infection.  The other reason I will not be going back there is lack of patience and bedside manner by Dr. Nichols.  When you are already not feeling well, the last thing you need is to deal with a doctor who is impatient, with a very accusatory bedside manner, and also  making incorrect assumptions about you.  I really think he may be ready for retirement and I can no longer recommend this practice only because of him.    

It is true what the previous reviewer said about how the receptionists are quick to point out you need to go back for another appointment to talk to the doctor even soon after you just had a visit.  It seems some follow up to the previous problem would not be unreasonable for a call back to answer questions.  This only happened once over the course of over 3+ years of going there, I would 99% of the time have to go back for another visit to talk about a related question, so I do back up the previous reviewer on yelp.",1
2081,"Good prices until the owner decided not to  take ownership of his staff ruining 2 of my shirts. I was told something to the effect of ""There is no way we could've put those stains on your shirts""... I guess it's an impossibility for dry cleaner to ruin shirts. His compromise was offering me a $20 credit, which would've covered 20% of the value of the shirts lost. I won't continue to play Russian roulette with my nice clothing... I'd advise you to do the same. The humorous part of the whole thing is I probably spent over $50 per month on dry cleaning... a savvy business person would've pulled my account, realized the value of a good customer, and done the right thing.",1
2083,"Best. Cannolo. Ever. I have literally never eaten a better one. And I've had them from the famous Mike's pastry in boston's north end, as well as Modern, which some think is better. Both pale in comparison to Presti's!!!",5

2086,"This was my first experience at an escape room, and I have to say, The Sleuth Box set the bar high!! It was such a fun experience, and so different from anything I've done before.

I can't wait to go back when they open their second room.",5
2089,My mom and I visited Eric as I was trying to get a second opinion on a very special necklace and bracelet that I have and had already had appraised to see how it compared.  He was extremely honest and professional. I've dealt with other jewelers in the past and regret not meeting him sooner.,5
2092,"Where I succeed in my workouts, I fail in my diet. But that's alright, because it's always nice to come back to town from the Midwest and try new restaurants. I appreciate the Mexican food here so much more than I used to, and Taqueria Mi Casita is your typical hole-in-the-wall, authentic restaurant. The Al Pastor burrito was incredible. As the burritos and tacos went down the line, they were prepared with speed and precision, with talent that makes you dread the next Chipotle visit (but not really).

I look forward to supporting this small business on my next trip back to Chandler!",5
2093,"They price matched the dealership and were all very pleasant. Their price quotes were reasonable at first, not the best, but not the worst either. They were willing to price match. The staff was friendly and even offered some of their lunch (pizza) to the customers in the waiting room. They didn't try to upsell and make unnecessary repairs ( I researched and got quotes from multiple places), which I appreciate and will continue to go back to these guys. Thanks",5
2094,"I am vegan and my ENTIRE family is not.  I was blown away when i found out last week that they have a VEGAN pizza!  I am always up to trying mainstream restaurants with a healthy dish for us non-carnivores.  I ordered a 10 inch Veganizza and added red onion. My husband and father-in-law ordered a medium 1/2 pepperoni and 1/2 red onion.  Each person was completely happy with the pizza.  My pizza was delicious.  They used Daiya cheese, basil, spinach, garlic and red onion.  I will for sure get it again.  It's so close and so delicious.  

I wondered why they even made a vegan pizza and it turns out that the owner's son is vegan.  Who knew!  This pizza was created for him.  LOVE IT!!! Nice job, NYPD!  Nice Job!!!",5
2095,"This is a no-frills nail salon. Ask for Tammy. She does a spectacular job at fake nails with gels. I always go back for her to do the fill. It's not a super pretty salon, so don't expect that. But they are affordable, and they will get you in if you call ahead. If you walk in, expect to wait! People complaining about waiting are ridiculous. There are not many nail techs working all at once, so they can't help everyone right when they walk in. You should definitely call ahead with this place.",5
2096,"Love this place! Favorite restaurant in Madison. I don't live there anymore, but when I returned for a visit, this is the first place I went. They take reservations on Open Table and I suggest making one, especially on nights when there are shows at the Overture center because they get really busy.

I always start with a glass of prosecco or wine and an order of the bacon wrapped dates! They have a large selection of wines and the dates are amazing. I've tried almost all the pizzas and pastas, and none of them have disappointed. My favorite pasta is the Tagliatelle. I pretty much get that every time now and don't try anything new - when you find something that works, why change? 

I also have to give this place 5 stars for service. One time when I ordered the Tagliatelle, it was mostly sauce. There wasn't a lot of pasta. By the time I finished eating the pasta, I was left with a plate of meat sauce. I pointed this out to the waiter, and asked if I could just have more pasta to mix in with the sauce. Instead, the chef made me a brand new dish (a little smaller than the usual because I requested it be a small portion) and I got to take lots of leftovers home. Anytime I've had an issue, they've always addressed it quickly and with a smile.",5
2097,"Nice joint! Take the best-selling pulled pork sandwich and you will be satisfied! It's nice, juicy, fresh and has an amazing taste! I would recommend to take home potatoes as side dish. After taking this lunch you will be thinking  about a nap :-)",5
2098,"Have I really never reviewed Lo-Lo's? Seriously?? 

This morning, Dottsy, Robert M and I headed for SoDo (is that what the hipsters are calling the area just south of downtown?) for some chicken and waffle perfection. Lo-Lo's hits the mark on everything: my gravy and onion covered chicken was all sorts of awesomeness, the waffles were golden brown loveliness, the greens were bang on, the mac and cheese a creamy blissful experience, the red beans and rice were smartly appealing and the fried okra was splendid happiness. Sure, we ordered a lot of sides, but we wanted to be fair. 

Lo-Lo's was like a religious experience--Sunday service was being played on the radio, there were babies crying, their food is also served in Heaven (or at least that's keeping me focused on the afterlife). 

As well as being perfectly filled with some of the best food ever, we also had a marketing brainstorming session. The first was a tour of some great soul food restaurants using Metro and make it into a UYE. Its name? Pause for dramatic effect: The Soul Train. Something else came up but we're keeping a tight lid on that project.",5
2099,Love this place! My family and I have been regulars here ever since I was little. The food is always amazing and the staff are so friendly! The owners are the best!,5
2100,"Yup. Five-stars. 

From the moment I walk inside, I feel happy. My go-to drink is the Taro Slush. It's lightly sweet and the most beautiful shade of purple. It's blended to creamy perfection and topped with fresh taro. I go boba free because I am simply not a fan. I'm always greeted warmly by the staff who are like a machine. They have waves of busy times, but all the time, so don't let the long line intimidate you. They move fast and know what they are doing.

My latest trip I was tempted to order an actual tea but wasn't sure what I wanted. The girl at the register was super nice and took her time with me while I pushed myself out of my Taro Slush comfort zone. I ordered the Peach iced tea and added the Sea Salt Cream. It sounded good at the time and it was a pretty tasty combo! I probably wouldn't order my personalized creation again but I was a big fan of the tea itself. The sea salt cream is heaven.

I wish the menu was a bit more descriptive but that's because I get ordering anxiety sometimes (you should see me at a drive-thru). Anytime I have a question, the staff at Brew Tea Bar will make sure I'm taken care of.",5
2101,"This place is a regular stop for me and my family. It doesn't matter if it is just for regular dinner or a special occasion. The food is simple, yet fast and elegant. The staff is knowledgable and always attentive. I recommend this place for anybody that loves good food and amazing service.",5
2103,"This was my first time coming to this place, and right off the back I found it very homey. I looked at past reviews and boy it made me hungry. The service here are very friendly, smiling, laughing, bickering, just like a family, well at least like my family. I took out this time but waiting for my food was interesting enough to keep my appetite. Food kept rolling out to the customers at the tables at a fast pace and boy did it smell and look yummy. The mozzarella sticks were soooo good, breading was on point. They gave me salad and bread sticks on the side that I didn't know about. The chicken wings were crispy, juicy and spicy just the way I wanted them to be. Lastly the spaghetti, was amazing. The meatballs were not overcooked, the sauce was a littlw tangy from the tomatoes which enhanced the flavor. All in all, I noticed family after family came in and out with smiles on their faces. It is a diamond in the rough for sure because food looks bomb and tastes great too.  I'm really glad I found this place, and I plan to come back :)",5
2104,"Good food, good price, good service.  Got the falafel, it was very filling.  Hostess was really nice (went during lunch hours).",5
2106,No sign - door is locked. Voicemail is still working but at 1:30 pm on a Saturday this place is definitely not open for business.,1
2107,What a pleasant surprise. Their salads are served in a seasoned bread bowl - how unique!  I had their chicken ceasar salad and caprese salad.  Both were fresh and delicious.  Nice wine selection and food came out fast.  I can't wait to go back again.,5
2109,"Delicious, high quality Indian food with great ambiance.   I could eat here once a week",5
2110,"This turned out to be one of the ONLY places OPEN for breakfast when we were here at the airport as we did search for a better option but turned out almost nothing .

We we stood to order and a worker stayed there scrubbing the fryer and we waited and waited then a cook came out sipping coffee and said ""someone will be with us shortly"" after a few minutes more people were pile-ling up in line and the person scrubbing the fryer decided on taking orders . We ordered the breakfast egg muffin sandwiches with the hash-browns and they were tossed to us from a drawer below the counter almost warm in foil and we were told they would make some hash-browns soon . I did see hot dogs spinning be thought they might be from last night but as it turned out I fear the breakfast sandwich might have been older . 

I took a bite and even after adding ketchup salt and pepper THIS WAS NOT EDIBLE . The muffin was uncooked without nooks or crannies and sort of had a solid cardboard taste (YUK!) I don't have a clue on how to make an inedible egg the way they did it because it was far worst than any frozen or microwaved egg , not only was it UNFIT for HUMAN consumption I also would NEVER feed my DOG something this NASTY . The egg (?egg) was thick and solid and might have been mixed with something unknown or was maybe just so old I just don't know , or a combination of both , I couldn't sample more to figure it out . THE CHEESE (NOT CHEESE) was thick ORANGE something between WAX , PASTE , RUBBER and Slime so these sandwiches WENT IN THE TRASH FAST!

The hash-browns were edible they turned out to be chopped up french fries ate a few forks full .

I KNOW THIS ISN'T THE RITZ -BUT THIS WAS THE PITS
As far as I am concerned they stole $15 from us .",1
2112,"Bacchanal is my must go-to buffet spot in Vegas! (with the other one being Wicked Spoon). Yummm love their lunch buffet with bottomless mimosa and unlimited fresh grapefruit juice! Downside is that there's always a huge line, but I guess, well it's Vegas lol.",5
2114,"6 fast super chargers in a covered parking lot. Kind of a sketchy part of downtown Vegas but did the trick and was close to a couple places to eat. Convenient if you are passing through Vegas, not convenient if you are staying south of the strip. Just punch it into your nav, it's easy to find and the parking lot entrance has a red tesla sign that easy to spot",5
2115,"DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY FROM THIS PLACE...unless you want to enjoy a cold pizza an hour late. This has happened twice now in the past month. I will admit that the pizza is actually good, but when you have to wait two hours when the stated max time is an hour and you must reheat it once it Finally arrives, it just isn't as tasty. We live eight minutes from the location and called after waiting an hour and a half and the response was, ""it's on the way!""  no reason as to why it's been so long, and then we continued to wait for 30 more minutes. **We also really enjoyed having ranch dressing with our GREEK salads... 

There are PLENTY of other pizza places and even if this pizza was actually the ""best"" (which it's not), it is  worth the time OR getting the wrong order.",1
2116,"Wish I could give negative stars. Henderson Properties was the worst for over 3 years we rented from a property they managed. If not for my having the owners contact info, not sure if anything would have ever been repaired or attended to. I could list so many things, I should have known from day one when we pulled up to move in and the carpets still.had dog feces on it from the previous tenant. We were promised the house would be cleaned and it never was. It took me getting the owner involved to just get the carpets cleaned. Fast forward to move out. They would not do a personal walk thru after we did a clean up for move out. So knowing the history, I took photos. When I receive my security deposit they deducted for missing window screens. I sent them pics showing they were there when we left. Even appealed the decision. They still ended up keeping $196 for screens someone must have stolen when we left. And $95 for an outlet box on the front porch that was never there. They also charged $20 to remove a small ""no solicitation"" sticker on the screen door, that is STILL on it. I have friends there still.",1
2120,"I'm rating for all or nothing and I am all in. That was great!  The husbands choice for dinner tonight and he was dead on.  I miss my Bohemian restaurant ""The Westchester Inn"" in Westchester, IL for their breaded pork. Never been able to find a crispy delicious breading to match but we have now!

I saw the gigantic table in the middle of the restaurant and was counting the chairs  to see how many family members I can invite. 

I had the Rahm Schnitzel and husband had the J√§ger. Although he liked his, he liked mine better....me too.  The red cabbage was amazing. I would get the potato dumpling next time instead of the pasta (I forgot what it is called).

We will be back!

Almost forgot to mention the great service, very friendly and the cutest outfits. We even had entertainment from an accordionist.  I will also say it was very clean.",5
2122,"i have been seeing Jenny Savage for over 6 years now. I have a weird challenging wave and a lot of hair, probably a hairstylist worst nightmare. Jenny has not only made my hair shiny and healthy she cuts my hair in a way that lays perfectly weather I let it air dry or blow dry it, Now let me tell you about the real fun part color. She is truly AMAZING you can bring her any picture and she will master it to perfection, she's detailed, well educated and always taking the latest classes to make her clients feel amazing about their hair and I love catching up about life with her she's funny and full of random information which always makes conversation fun and interesting. I usually see her in her San Diego location but since i was in Las Vegas this week and I decided to come see her salon in Las Vegas, I loved it the experience was great, but it always is with Jenny. I always walk out feeling like a million bucks. I LOVE my hair!!!!
If you live in Las Vegas or are visiting you will definitely hit the jackpot with Jenny, love her! :)",5
2123,"We had an excellent experience overall purchasing a dining table from here!
Natassja at the Caledonia store was very friendly, informative, and helpful. We chose a table off the floor, and had different legs shipped to the store. They arrived very quickly (~1 week), and we arranged to pick up the table ourselves. We were immediately helped when we arrived for our pickup. No complaints whatsoever, I would definitely shop here again!",5
2124,"Highly recommend you check their website for available inventory if you're looking to buy a new car. This place sets the standard for how buying a used car should be. I went in looking to check out a Honda Pilot, I wasn't buying quite yet but wanted to get a feel for the vehicle and compare a few. Brad was sooo easy to work with. No hassle, no pressure, no stress what's so ever! He offered to let me take a test drive and had me put my info on an iPad & handed me the keys. I haven't yet purchased a vehicle but for sure I will be checking what Millenium has available when I'm ready to purchase.",5
2127,Very disappointed. Walked in. Very rudely told no appointment no service. So I made an appointment and came back. They left me waiting 30 minutes could have walked in somewhere else and waited 30 minutes. Do not recommend very rude guy running it named Danny.,1
2128,"If I could rate a ZERO star I would!  Was told there was a 20 minute wait to be seated. That was a lie! Took 45 minutes.  When we finally did sit down, it took another 10 minutes for our waitress to come take our order. After taking our order it took another 45 minutes for our food to come out! 
Terrible service! Waitress didn't come by to check on us! Would not recommend this place! Try Phoenix location. Much better service!",1

2130,if you get into a car accident and they're telling you to go to Pain Managment DO NOT go here they do not know what they are doing....they were supposed to put the lien that I filled out and sent it to the attorney which they NEVER did and this was five years ago and they sent me to collections because the people in their office don't know what they are doing... if they were actually sufficient and did what they were supposed to do then I wouldn't have this issue and be fighting with them and the collection agency...if they did what they were supposed to do they would've got paid a few years back. on top of that how they treat people is horrible DO NOT GO HERE!,1
2131,"Terrible direction of flow for customer service. Odd staff turnover, oppressed atmosphere. Extra Insurance for phone buys you more headaches and rudeness. Always a scam feel and always about upgrades. Save your time. Maybe other stores have their act on par, this one has always cheated me and the solution is always the same. Keep Tossing money until resolution happens. 
When my contract is up I'll be free.
Wish I could give 0 stars.",1
2133,"I'd like to stay out by saying I have very sensitive teeth, and have had multiple bad experiences with dentists. In the past I could only bare sleep dentistry. Dr Bunn has done a fair amount of work on me over the course of a few visits. I don't need sleep dentistry anymore, I don't even need nitrous, and I am fine. I have fallen asleep in his chair a few times, when with other dentists, I'd be death gripping the chair, and experiencing pain.

He does excellent work, he is friendly, and fast. The staff is wonderful, and super good at their jobs! Look if your insurance isn't accepted at his office... Get a new job. I love the way my smile looks now, and I'm over my fear of the dentist. Thanks again Dr Bunn.",5
2136,It's always busy they need more people working. The lady in the front is always rude. The line is always almost out the door. The parking lot is way to small. And they only have one person AF the front desk. Expect to wait atleast 20 to 30 mins,1
2138,"I have only used this Urgent Care center a couple of times, today being one, and they are awesome. I did not wait a long time. The staff was friendly and helpful. The doctor was polite and knowledgeable. As crappy as I was feeling, I really did not have anything make me stress out even more. Thank you guys!!!",5

2143,"Dr. Fish and his knowledgeable and caring staff have helped my elderly parent for more than a year. My parent has TMJ and is well over 90 years old. In addition, the age of this family member resulted in a requirement for serious dental surgery using general anesthesia.  Dr. Fish and his staff always showed the utmost kindness and gentleness towards this family member.  In addition, when the TMJ causes the family member's jaw to unhinge, he  fully advised us on all options, and always was available to help ""re-set"" the jaw.  We never have to wait on appointments and because we rely upon transport service to get to the office, his staff does everything to accommodate our arrangements.  We appreciate all that he is able to do for our family and highly recommend him for his orthodontic services.",5

2152,"I have lived in the valley for over a year and with so many Pho places, it's hard to finally pick one and try it.  I have been to only one other Pho restaurant here and it was amazing.  But it's 40 minutes away.  I was feeling pretty ill one night (hangover, i admit it!) and consulted yelp on a Pho restaurant that was open at 9:30 PM.  It led me to this restaurant in a shopping center.  I called them and asked if it was too late to place an order.  The lady on the other end of the line was more than happy to take my order regardless of the late time.  In a hurry, I went to go pick up my cherished Pho Ga (chicken soup).  When I came home I was super stoked to see how much they give you for $6.00.  Plenty of noodles, plenty of bean sprouts and my FAVORITE (and this is where most restaurants fall short) is they do not skimp on the basil.  They are also very generous with the jalapenos and cilantro.  Overall, I would absolutely consider this restaurant my go-to place when that Pho Craving hits.",5
2153,"Checked this place out today, wanted to get my hair trimed and have my bangs cut by a professional. Over the past several years I cut my own hair, so going in was a big deal for me! 

I enjoyed the wash with a scalp massage! It was relaxing. Then I told her what I wanted and after a few more questions, she got to it. 

I haven't been one to do much in the way of style or primping, but it felt good and she was quick but thorough!

This was a nice experience, she was fast, direct, confident and enjoy the 'salon' conversing!  She even told me she offered free triming of the bangs! Might have to take her up on it.",5
2154,Some of the best customer service I've ever experienced while planning my sister's bachelorette party. Kam kept me updated throughout the process and checked up to date on everything. The best part was he even helped me save money by letting me know of when the club crawl tickets we're going to go on sale. Highly recommended!,5
2155,"As a perspective employer they have to be the worst around here, I have applied as a driver for them and with many many years of safe cimmercial driving they wouldn't hire me for a part time job of moving RV's because ""I have had to many jobs"" in my opinion they are looking for the perfect old man who is retired and had one career job but the pay for this doesn't warrant that, and I will continue to voice my concerns on pleces like YELP.",1
2156,"The beef was all fat. The sauces were overly salty, and TONS OF MSG!

First plate of beef looked ok, but the second was just a plate of fat, and the color of the 'meat' looked strange. Low quality meat. Tofu was sour as well. I like the concept of bringing the meats to your table, it is more hygenic I get it, but the quality of meat brought to us was just abysmal.

I think that they add tons of MGS in the broth, because I had drank 5 glasses of liquids at their restaurant and went home with dry mouth along with everyone else in our group. At night I had drank another 2 glasses of water, and in the morning still dry mouth. I think that they add salt to their sauces and MSG to their broth to make people drink more and eat less (BRILLIANT).

Service there is good and bad. The lady server was very nice and did a great job. The young guy server was rude and condescending. You have to speak English to get great service from that guy. We waited 20 minutes for a plate of lamb, and when we asked when it would come he said ""Wait your turn"". Uhh, I have ordered 20 minutes ago, what  turn?? The people at the table next to us caucasians spoke english, and everything with them was ""yes sir"", and ""right away"" and they got their meats 2 minutes from the time they ordered. Other Chinese people at the table next to us said the same thing about the service.

There was a large group next to us that had to have 20+ people, and they were complaining that they only brought 10 shrimps for 20 people. haha Everybody got 1/2 a shrimp to eat.

Never again will I go here! Owner very shrewd business people.

BTW, if you go here on Friday night don't worry no lineups!!",1
2157,"I've been coming here since as long as I can remember... and I still love it. I lived in Tucson, and would make day trips just to come eat here. 
I'm a little disappointed that they made their bows smaller, kinda seems to me like they were looking to follow the ""genghis"" way... considering their competition is just down the street. But nonetheless this place holds a little piece of my heart... and I will still continue to come here time after time.",5
2158,"I stay at La Quinta all the time, but I probably won't anymore after this trip. This hotel was GROSS. The shower head had mold growing on it and the toilet had poop stains in it. Absolutely disgusting. And the room smelled like a homeless person had been living there. Trust me when I say that this place is not worth anyone's time or money.",1
2160,"We chose this one after looking through the menu. From the outside it's pretty nice and then you walk in ... ahhh ambiance. Very pretty inside. Once inside the service is excellent. I had veal and my gf had pasta. The veal (porcini mushroom sauce) was probably one of the most tender pieces of veal I've had in a very long time. Yummy, Marinated in wine. My gf's pasta was also very good. The wine list is pretty good but expensive. Food was reasonably priced and well prepared. I will definitely be back!",5

2166,"I am sorry to learn that this company has continued to victimize other individuals. I am posting my experience on this website (also documented on another website) to help would-be-victims mitigate engaging this moving company. Please note that Capital Moving is also affiliated/associated with Vegas LIne Moving and Storage Services.

I am a student who engaged Capital Moving Services to move from Vancouver to Montreal. I used this company because they offered the best cost quote. When my items were delivered, Capital Moving Services requires that you pay them before the items are moved off the truck. I was careful to check off the inventoried items (as inventoried by Capital Moving and myself when they were picked up in Vancouver) as they were taken off the truck. One box of items valuing approximately $2500 did not appear. When I asked about the missing box, the mover said 'oh yes, they knew about the missing box'. I followed up with Capital Moving Services right away and they indicated that they were 'looking for the box'. 

Over the following 8 days, I had to contact them numerous times (they didn't follow up with me). At their instruction, I then finally filed a claim form because I had purchased $2000 of declared value insurance for $42. 4 weeks later I had not heard back so I followed up and was told that a claim response was going to be sent out. Upon receipt of the report the following week indicated that I was entitled to  $2000/61 items (where an item is a box, broom, wood futon piece, etc.) = 32.78 - $300 deductible  = $0 compensation. I sent an e-mail indicating that I would not accept their claim response for non-delivery my box of items. 

I received an e-mail response from the manager EB indicating that they could provide some nominal compensation. When I filed a complaint through the Better Business Bureau, EB eventually offered a $75 compensation credit. I did not accept this offer for the $2500 worth of non-delivered boxed items and alarmingly the BBB has closed the case and indicated ""Bureau judged complaint resolved"". Moreover, the BBB agent that handled this case refused to change this claim resolution. So the lesson is to consult the BBB website regarding complaints for a company but ignore the BBB conclusions as they may not represent the true case result (unfortunately such problems with specific BBBs have been noted before - you can google Mid-Western and Central Ontario Better Business Bureau and Beware to view). 

I hope that in describing this ordeal it will mitigate further victims of Capital Moving Services. In short, don't use Capital Moving Services, your moved items are not safe and may not be returned to you and, as other Capital Moving customers have indicated, one way or another it is going to cost you much more than you expected.",1

2171,"Sandra is very professional and an outstanding chef and I would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a private chef. 

Sandra was very flexible and as excited about my very unique request to ""Dine in the Dark"" for a special occasion as I was. She designed a delicious menu that hit our palates perfectly with little to no guidance other than a quick review of our wine rack and learning that we are ""foodies"". If Sandra had not told me that this was her first experience serving a couple who intentionally could not see and had no prior knowledge of the menu, I would have never known because she was so cognitive of the unique challenges we would be facing by not being able to see. 

Sandra was outstanding in her planning and execution and brought everything that was needed. I am looking forward to working with Sandra again in the very near future. Maybe for another ""Dinner in the Dark""!",5

2174,"This place is legit! First of all I appreciated the fact that they have a decent amount of seating so for a Wednesday around 10:30 5 of us were able to just sit down. By the time we left... Completely different story! After eating breakfast here, I totally get why it was packed when we left! (I promise I will get to the corned beef soon). The service was pretty good. The women must have been working there forever and they really are excited to see people come in. We got our food super fast and had as much coffee available to us that we could ever want. The menu was pretty basic, but let's face it we were all there for one thing and one thing only. They had other breakfast and lunch items if you are the one person in Cleveland that doesn't like corned beef. 

When first looking through the menu I thought the corned beef prices were pretty high, and then I saw what they gave you and it all made sense. The sandwiches are HUGE! No one actually needs that much food but this corned beef basically melts in your mouth so I can totally see how people eat it all! I ordered a corned beef breakfast sandwich with corned beef, egg, and Swiss cheese, of course in rye bread. So good!  Our table also ordered the corned beef hash with eggs. Also amazing! 

This was totally worth the trip. If you are a corned beef fan you MUST come here. It is worth the drive downtown! You will leave happy and with a full belly!",5
2175,"The Bell Center is awesome, I've been here for a number of concerts and games over the years and the place is top notch.

2176,"So I think the first Boyz II Men review here started with their stint before the Mirage, but mine is for their set at the home of Siegfried and Roy. 

As I posted on my Facebook, these three muchachos brought down the house like we were all at a gospel revival. The praising! The weeping! The worshiping! If Jesus had returned in the Second Coming at the back of the theater, He might actually have been ignored because this throwback was out of control. Women were rushing the stage for roses as if they were in a mosh pit and men were imitating the crooning like they usually do when they hit up the karaoke bar. 

I went to the show with some of my best friends and it was the most fun return to junior high in my life. I know I wasn't the only girl in the theater thinking about how many boys I'd slow danced with while clapping our hands on each others' shoulders two feet away from each other while trying not to smile with our braces showing. 

A hit for sure!",5

The manager did comp the entire bill but we will NOT ever return. This was their last chance at redemption and they totally blew it we will not return.",1
2186,Jenny and Halle are both excellent. I have used their waxing services for several years and they are professional and make the process quick and easy. Appointments are conveniently made on their website. I wouldn't consider going anywhere else.,5

2191,"Oh my word, FINALLY CHARLOTTE. You have delivered and Fin & Fino did not disappoint. 

Justin didn't have high expectations walking in, but something inside of me did, and we both left so thrilled with our experience from start to finish.

We weren't able to get reservations since we were last minute walking home and decided to pop in for dinner, which was fine, because the bar was perfect for us and it was totally meant to be because Rebecca, the bartender, was knowledgeable, kind, soft spoken, attentive, just asked enough questions, and took pride in taking care of her guests. I haven't had service experience like this in a long time and coming from the industry myself, it was so welcomed.

We split the Tower of Power. Looking back, we should have probably done the smaller tower and ordered the hot mussels because J didn't love the cold ones (but I did). We were *slightly* disappointed in the oysters on both taste and size, but over all were very happy.

We are so excited to visit again and try other dishes...and of course, sit at the bar.

The open concept of this space is gorgeous, airy and light. Love the kitchen windows and the cleanliness and the decor. It's the perfect date-night spot on all levels.",5
2192,"I hired this company to perform handyman services, only some of which were completed satisfactorily. I was only offered a refund of one hour of labor.

I contacted this company to perform certain services, including plumbing, and do not think I was remiss in expecting a handyman with skills to perform these specific tasks.  

Of the eight repairs needed, the three biggest and most involved were not completed satisfactorily, or at all in one instance. 

I asked the company to discover and repair the source of a warped board in my guest bathroom and to replace the board. The worker lifted the toilet to replace a wax ring; he put epoxy on the existing board and re-set it. It remains out of alignment with the rest of the flooring (not flat). He never discussed additional costs for labor to lift and replace the board. In subsequent communications, the owner has provided THREE DIFFERENT reasons for why this work was not performed.

I asked the company to replace my kitchen faucet. The worker, who admitted he is a roofer (versus a plumber or true, multi-disciplined handyman) by profession, did not know how to turn the water off to my entire condo (versus just the sink itself) and did not tell me that he was not authorized to replace valves, which proved to be part of the necessary work. He sent me to Lowe's to purchase parts in the wrong size or that are nonexistent. I only got the right ones thanks to the professionals there. He advised me to find out how to shut the water off and that when I did, he would return to complete the repairs. Instead, the owner told me that I would have to call a plumber to complete the repair because his workers are not allowed to replace valves. He said he advised his employee to tell me this, but he did not.

I asked the company to replace my bathroom faucet. The worker did so, but left me with a host of new issues, including significantly reduced water pressure and significantly increased wait time for hot water to arrive in the sink. I did not have these issues before the faucet was replaced. The owner of the company blames these brand-new issues on my selection of faucet rather than his employee's incompetence. When a trained professional plumber came to my home to make the kitchen faucet repairs that were not made by this company, he was able to resolve my bathroom faucet issues with a few simple, quick tweaks.

The owner of the company, who came to my home on July 4 to assess the situation, responded to my July 7 request for a status update and discussion of a partial refund with a lengthy personal-attack email, among other things calling me passive-aggressive and ignorant, accusing me of demanding free service, ""verbal and attitudinal abuse"" and, most unbelievably, calling into question my faith with the words: ""I hope that you find your place at the foot of the cross."" 

This sanctimonious self-righteousness is entirely inappropriate in a business setting, as is this completely unwarranted personal attack on me. I hired this company to perform certain tasks in my home and expected to have hired skilled professionals. That was not the case. At no point did I personally attack the owner for conducting business in such an unethical fashion. I was truly stunned to be addressed in such a disrespectful and unprofessional manner. He continued his personal attacks in the public forum of the BBB website and refused to refund the money I paid for work that was not completed at all or not completed satisfactorily. Beware of engaging this company for any services.",1
2193,"So just had a bad experience. I got the best fish tacos in the world which I have been craving all night. Then when I get done eating the tacos. After explaining to my girlfriend how they don't taste the same. I am sorting through the rest of the bags to at least enjoy their complimentary bread. I find the salsa for the tacos in the bread bag.
They had the green sauce with the tacos but the salsa in the bread bag.
I mean who would even look in there and to top it off, there was no limes, or lemons for my girlfriends water.
I am just very upset because they tacos weren't the best fish tacos anymore.",1
2194,"So many yummy things to admire and eat, so little time!  If I had run into this place earlier in my trip, I would have come back every day.

The dough they use for their buns is the most delicious that I've ever had.  And, the black sesame mochi and the green tea sponge cake were delightful.  I also had a honeydew milk bubble tea that was to die for.  

For the things I didn't eat, I wish I could have.  All the cakes, pastries, and buns are so beautifully made that it makes you automatically think, ""Eat that"".  If they had a cyanide mochi, I would probably try it.

Definitely stop at Harmonie when you are in Montreal.  You will not be sorry!",5
2199,"service always top notch.... 
And the food never dissapoints... usually do the surf and turf but this time we decided on the 5lb lobster.... delicious
thank you david",5
2200,"Horrible.   The soup taste like brown gravy, the macaroni was dry and flavorless.  The bone in rib eye at 31.00 was horrible. After i asked for extra seasoning and medium well. Half the steak was rare and still flavorless. Taste like black pepper.  The waitress asked if. Wanted them to put it back on grill. Really.",1
2201,"We visited today for the first time. We had two breakfast sandwiches - #22 & #66. We asked for our poached eggs to be soft. The owner explained why it might be difficult (because of the grill machine) but then accomplished it. I was expecting the #22 to have a nice smoky chipotle flavor but it was overpowered by the mustard (which wasn't mentioned in the description). When the owner came by to see how we liked our sandwiches, I mentioned this. She promptly made me another without the mustard and at no additional charge. That's the way service should be! Thin, crispy bread is exactly what I want in a sandwich and they do it perfectly. We will definately be back. And this will be my new take out spot for workday lunch.",5
2202,"Fresh fresh fresh! 

As soon as you walk in the store, rows of fresh mangos stare back at you atop a counter with even more mangos. Is it a surprise that Presotea specializes in Mango type drinks? Anywhere from mango pearls to mango slush, if it's mango, they have it. Our first trip here we went ahead and ordered their teas which were refreshing and with a mix of less ice and less sugar, they were close to perfect. Their ingredients were alright as most of them are just from the jugs that you do find at almost all other tea places.

The fresh mango drinks, this is what Presotea is great at. We ordered a fresh mango slush that had a generous portion of fresh mango chunks and you can tell that all the ingredients are extremely fresh. It had less ice and less sugar so that the flavor of the actual mango came through. If you love mangos, you can get your liquid gold fix here.",5
2203,Stopped in about 1am had a slice of pepperoni pizza. Amazing! Fam also had the BLT and Italian sandwiches which were so fresh and delicious. Wow! Great food. Great spot.,5
2205,"Awful experience, came in with a couple of friends, food is mediocre at best and well overpriced. 
Drinks are also well overpriced and bar staff are apparently only interested in getting phone numbers. 
Waiting an unreasonable amount of time for both food and drink, paying way too much considering the quality or lack there of, add into that the non existent service is why ladies and gents I will not be returning to this establishment nor will I endorse them.",1
2210,"I've been here so many times that I've lost count. The food is ALWAYS cooked perfectly to order. The servers are quick, efficient, and friendly. I'm always excited to try the new items that they are constantly adding to the menu. Right now my favorite dish is the Alfredo pasta, which comes with either spaghetti or penne noodles, Alfredo sauce, chicken, mushrooms, pesto bread, and parmesan cheese. The portions are quite large, so I'm always able to split them or take food to go. Drinks can also be taken to go. You can make your own custom smoothie. The coffees are super yummy! I strongly suggest the hazelnut latte. This place is great for any meal time of the day. Its location is very convenient too because it's located next to many shops and other attractions. I love this place and will continue to return and show my friends. :)",5

2214,"Was very disappointed when we were not refunded our money back after the gym closed. We were told to go to our bank for a ""chargeback"". We had been members since they first opened. There was a lot of shady stuff going on there, too, with accidents, break ins, closings and insurance claims. Andre seemed like a nice guy, but I cernainly would never do business with him again!",1
2215,"This is one of my favourite Italian places in the city.  It looks small, but with the added seating on the second level (indoor and outdoor) and the outdoor patio, can handle a suite of visitors.

The ambiance is friendly and casual, bright with character accents that allow the food to stand out.  And stand out it does.

Pizzas and pastas taste fresh and delicious, with some classic standards (Margerita pizza, spaghettini bolognese) and other favourites.  It takes me awhile to select what I want to eat off of this menu: I've tried much of it and never had a complaint.  In fact, most of the time I'm swooning over how delicious my pasta is.

The wine list is fine, with table wines that are fairly light and able to be paired with most dishes. Service is attentive, and if you're in the main dining area, you can watch the cooks prepare your meal.

I have not tried their desserts - admittedly, I'm always too full by the end of my meal.  That being said, I'd go back in a heartbeat.",5
2217,They're always sooo fast when I go through the drive thur. Always super friendly and nice! Which I appreciate in fast food workers. Let's be honest I know their job isn't always the easiest having to deal with people. Whether it's at 8am when I'm stopping before work or at midnight. I never have to think twice about stopping and being late for work because I'm in the drive thur for 5 mins top. Food is always good too! Never had an issue here.,5
2218,"This coffee shop already gets extra points for being open on Sundays! A rare find on the west side of Madison. Their coffee drinks are delicious (nothing out-of-the-ordinary, though) and I've been meaning to try their food because every time I go in my mouth starts to water just reading the menu. 

The inside space is a bit cramped and it can be hard to find adequate seating sometimes. With that being said, I've never gone there and been left standing. They have this really neat gazebo/snow globe-y structure out front that is a plastic-covered seating area and it has a space heater for chilly days. That can be a nice place to sit if you're wanting to be outside - even when it's raining!",5
2219,"I only ate there once, and it is because the service was terrible the food was terrible. The meat was very dry, the rice was very dry, and things that they said we're not spicy turned out to be very spicy. We got our rice a half an hour after we got our meat, and had to ask for it.",1
2221,"WORST customer service, IVE EVER experienced.
No fucking LIE. PUT down my ball's, all in, worst customer service.

We bought the groupon deal. Cool $35. Its confirmed, emailed, we showed them. They said we have to wait 45 minutes to go in their system. ""We'll tell you when it's ready""  

Okay, how the hell do you know WHO I AM for you to tell me its ready? 

""Can you check with my order number if its ready?"" 
She said no, we'll tell you. And I'm thinking, how the hell does she know who I am.

Come in 45 minutes later, she asks me for my ID, TELLS ME ITS NOT READY. SHE ASKED ME FOR MY ID? 

I thought she knew who I  was. Tells me to check back in line in 10 minutes. NOT READY AND CANT FIND ME  ASKS me for my order number when I asked HER if she can look up the order number since its already confirmed. 


Her name is DANIELLE. Maybe its not her. But fuck this place and service and Groupon deal. You don't fucking take money and expect a customer to wait 45-1hr after the order is confirmed with invoice and everything.",1
2222,"I checked into the ""D"" hotel for the evening and was greeted at the registration desk by a nice, polite young lady. During check-in I was asked if I ever stayed at the ""D"" hotel. I said no that I have been staying at another hotel on Fremont Street for several years and decided to try The D. 

The young lady welcomed me and checked me into a ""nice room on the 16th floor"". It was in fact a very nice room. After going to my room I returned to the Casino and Fremont St. I returned to my room later in the evening to retire for the night.

Well, at 5:58am I was awakened by hammering and power tools on the 17th floor right above my room and this continued for the rest of the morning.

While checking out I was again greeted by the same young lady who had checked me in on Wed. I asked her what the hammering was that wakened me at 5:58am and she replied that the whole 17th floor was being renovated and that the work was not supposed to start until 6:00am.

My question is why if the young lady at the check-in desk knew this information on Wed. would she put me in a ""nice room on the 16th floor""? If she would have told me at my check in that there was work being done on the 17th floor I would have asked for a different room on a different floor. I'm sure the hotel wasn't full on a Wed. night and if that was the case I would have chosen a different hotel.",1
2223,"Didn't want to review the place until I had the food.  The first two times I went I was on a liquid diet.  On my quest to find a cool place to watch the world cup games my co-worker told me about C&A.  

My first visit was for the U.S.-England game it was an awesome experience.  Even though the U.S. fans were out numbered a bit we represented.  Besides a couple cheeky remarks everyone got along wonderfully.  

Second visit to C&A was for the the U.S.-Algeria game, and unless you are a hermit we all know what happen that game.  Epicness happened.  When Donovan scored that goal it was absolute bedlam.  It is was one of the greatest moments of my life.  What a great feeling to celebrate something like that with your fellow countrymen and women.  But just like the England game all I had was beer.

It wasn't until recently that I had the food.  I was in the area and decided to give the food a try.  And I'm glad I did.  I had the Fish and chips and they were good.  I'm not really a fish guy, but I thought I would have the house specialty.  The truth is I would give this place a four star, but since I experienced one of the greatest thrills of my life it gets a five.  C&A is hand's down the best place in Vegas to watch Soccer and the food is good.",5

I heard several people discussing their amazing cheese plate, so that will be on my To Do List for sure.",5
2231,"Loooooved their tacos asada!  It's a decent size place and the service is really good, the food is served hot so be patient!  Nothing is precooked it all tastes fresh and make sure if you get a soda you ask to have the top popped off before leaving.  I definitely will return when back in Vegas.",5
2232,Came here during my lunch break from class and service was so quick and great! I'm not particular about sauce but this was the first time I noticed how great the sauce was! Absolutely delicious & worth going out of my way for! Also super budget friendly!,5
2236,"The food here is sooooo good. We've been coming here for quite some time. The family that owns it are so welcoming. The food is authentic, which is hard to find. (Robertos is not authentic). Great prices and specials. Definitely worth visiting if you haven't.",5
2238,"Bravo Chef Kenny!! Everything we ordered was fantastic and the service was so friendly. 4 of us dined for lunch and everything looked so amazing but we settled on the Rainbow Roll, Jackfruit Roll, Crunch Roll, seaweed salad, spicey eggplant (very mild spice) and the Chow Mein. It was Soooooooo gooooood!! The sushi rolls were killer.

The service was awesome and even Chef Kenny stopped by to welcome us. So happy he's opened his own spot bc this man kniws how to make amazing vegan dishes. Thank you for adding killer sushi rolls and we'll def me back!

Our servers were Li and Mimi, they offer Wi-Fi, takeout, have a Groupon so check them out!",5

I ordered chicken nachos yesterday and today my girlfriend and I both have food poisoning from them. 12 hours and we still havent stopped throwing up from both ends...hate to be crude but this place is shitty!!! Dont waste your time or money.  The parent company ought to shut this location down and fire all the workers in this location!,1
2250,"Went for a Sunday lunch and Grand Electric was busy, but we were still able to get a table for two without a wait. The atmosphere was fun and very casual. Definitely a place I'd go with friends but I don't think my parents would appreciate it as much. 

We really enjoyed the super fresh salsa, guac and chips while we mulled over which tacos to try. We each got three mini tacos and by far my favourite was the fish taco! I would love to back and eat many many more of them! The fish was battered: crispy but not greasy. There was a creamy but citrus-ee dressing and it was topped with a satisfying crunchy shredded slaw (can't remember what it was). I also loved that they were soft tacos (not a fan of hard shell tacos).",5

2255,"This place is great! We pulled in early and was assigned an area depending on if we wanted covered parking or not. Right away the shuttle pulled up while we were pulling our bags out of the car. The driver was very helpful and then after few stops we were whisked away to our terminal. 
On our arrival back home -finding a shuttle back to the lot was a breeze and didn't wait at all. We were again whisked back to the lot and immediately to our car again the driver was very helpful with our bags. 
On our way out to pay we each received water bottle and it was such an awesome treat since we were parched from our early morning (mostly sleeping) flight. 
We used our AAA discount and got a great deal -so if you have AAA I recommend printing out the ""coupon"" from the AAA website. 
We will definitely use this place again and it's better than inconveniencing your brother-cousin to drop you off at the airport and your sister yelling at you wondering where you are standing at the terminal doors.",5
2256,Alona is an awesome team player. There was a problem with my order and she took initiative immediately and took care of the situation with a smile. If she's not a manager she should become one you should take good care of her so that she will stay on board she is an asset.  Another thing that stood out to me is that she was the only one who picked up the receipts off of the ground while all the other employees just walked past them. To be fair it was very busy eight Friday night however she was also busy and she did not just walk past them she pick them up. That's a sign of great work ethic pride in her work.,5
2257,"Was really hungry with the family after a long day of walking around the Strip. Found out this halal pizza joint. The quality and portions of this place was excellent. They have a nice array of toppings for their pizza. Expect to pay about $10 per person. This is a good deal for the strip. 

We ordered the steak n cheese which was phenomenal. Then we had the buffalo pizza chicken and supreme pizza which had great texture, zingy tomato sauce, and crunchy crust. 

They cook everything in a made to order fashion which is why this place is so good. 

This is a wonderful place that is down to earth and made us return twice! 

Thank you Little Italy Pizza!",5
2259,"Cute little shop with an inviting atmosphere! 

We came here in the summer because we saw the chalk messages on the sidewalk (successful advertising!). Who doesn't want icecream? They had a selection of icecreams and after a few samples, we went with the green tea flavour. It's quite light and sweet, but very tasty! Eat it fast, because it'll melt so quickly.",5
2260,The service here is downright appalling. We made a reservation a week in advance and upon arriving a few minutes before our scheduled time they did not have our reservation down. We told them when we had called and even showed them in our phone. The owner said they just did not have it and there was nothing they could do even though it was their mistake. No offer of a discount or to squeeze us into the back to make up for losing our reservation. They offered to sit us outside in the humid 95 degree weather. They were rude and should really be ashamed. I could tell the waitress looked apologetic but the owner could care less. Hope the food makes up for the horrific service but due to how we were treated and how hot it was outside we did not stick around to find out.,1

2263,"There is no better bakery in the Phoenix-area than Honeymoon Sweets. I have been buying and enjoying their products since 2002 and I can testify that they make delicious cakes and treats, they are a top-notch creative team and they offer outstanding customer service. When planning my wedding, I did not consider any other bakery because I knew the Honeymoon Sweets team would be able to create my dream wedding cake and groom's cake... and they did! 

We worked closely with Alisa for months and had a great cake-tasting experience. She and the entire team were professional and exceeded our expectations. They were able to create a 3-tier wedding cake with 3 flavors in the design we wanted. I was also able to work with the cake-designing team on the groom's cake. They took my specific vision and turned it into a work of art. I was so pleased with both of our cakes! Both were exactly what I envisioned, not to mention absolutely delicious! 

Honeymoon Sweets delivers on every aspect of an outstanding bakery. They went above and beyond to make sure we had amazing experience and offered the highest quality of product and service. I highly recommend them for weddings, parties, events, holidays and any sweet-treat needs!",5

The next day, my wife attempted to talk to a manager about this incident but was on hold for so long, she finally hang up. She had to go in person to get a refund.

2270,"This is perhaps one of the slowest Starbucks I have ever been to. Yes, it is VERY busy especially when there is a convention or two or three going on, but even with two sets of registers to take people's orders, it took forever to get to the front of the line, and then another long wait to wait for the drinks to be made.

Also, I was very annoyed that they wouldn't let me use my reusable mug. It was such as waste of cups to make my drink in their plastic cups, which I threw away immediately after pouring the drink into my reusable mug. Shouldn't they be more sustainable-minded in this day and age, especially when every other Starbucks will gladly let you use your own reusable cup and they even usually encourage it by giving your a little bit of a discount. What a waste.

On top of that, everything is marked up and overpriced, probably because it's inside the convention center. They charged me extra for the soy milk that's supposed to be included in a regular iced coffee with milk, on top of the overall higher prices. I ended up paying almost $9 for an iced coffee and a fruit cup. Ridiculous.",1

Well we went back again and were once again disappointed.

2280,"Had the opportunity to try Queen Margherita Pizza last night. I've passed by this location many times before not knowing they have a large lower dining area. There is also an open kitchen with a large wood oven burning in the middle where the pizzas are cooked. The pizzas are true neopolitan style, and come with a variety of toppings. We had the calabrese pizza and the white pulled pork one. Both were delicious with generous toppings and the most delicious, sweet dough. I ate all of my crust (which is rare for me). We will definitely be back next time I'm in the area.",5
2281,"I love Qdoba but this specific Qdoba is nightmare fuel. First off when you walk in its dark and dirty and smelled like a school cafeteria (not a good smell) every table was dirty as well. I should have left but for some god forsaken reason I stayed and proceeded to head up front to order. The woman behind the counter looked very disheveled. She had stains and food all over her shirt, pants pretty much falling off her ass they were so loose, food covering her un gloved hands and on top of that she didn't say hello or welcome or anything instead she just says ""what do you want"" Umm I want you to get off your ass and clean this place lol but I didn't say that I told her my order and it was shortly after when I noticed this woman doesn't even know how to wrap a burrito she literally put the meat cheese etc in and rolled it like a play doh snake or some shit both ends wide open for all the stuff to fall right out.  Long story short I suggest think twice before going to this qdoba.",1
2282,"Short and sweet--I had a minor skin problem that turned into a gigantic annoyance/pain. Incessant itching to the point of me breaking the skin. My legs looked like battlegrounds from my claws :( Boyfriend all but forced me to head to a derm. I'm glad I finally took the leap, because I was quite miserable.

I, like many other reviews it seems, saw Mike Richards. The assistant that came in before him was so completely pleasant and nice, and she stuck around to take notes while he examined me as well. He immediately figured out what I should do (I'd developed a random form of eczema that wasn't visible to the eye but left me miserable), had her write me a Rx for medicine and since I first applied it the next night, I've been 100% cured. 

They insisted I schedule a followup appointment for a month later in case I needed anything, and said I was free to cancel it if my problem vanished like they said it would. Just called two days ago to happily cancel it. Quality of life: Plus 48302 happy points!",5
2284,Great service and food. They are always really nice. Their breakfast is my favorite!  Try their endless French toast it's the best. I also like their omelets. The American is my favorite. There are options for everyone. A good variety of treats. Their orange rolls are delicious. I haven't had something bad here.,5
2285,"Had a wonderful time!  We were here 4 days and 3 nights and only left the property a handful of times.  The room was wonderfully appointed with very minimal signs of any wear.  What you see in the pictures is pretty much exactly what you get.

Check in was a breeze.  The line moved very quickly!  All hands were on deck at the front desk. While we waited cold water was being offered to everyone in line, very nice touch.  The front desk itself isn't all that grand to be honest.  I wasn't impressed but I wasn't disappointed either.  Not as nice as the front desk at the wynn.  

The casino here is actually pretty small.  We found ourselves walking to the casino at the Wynn often but not a deal breaker since it's all connected and only a short walk.  Cocktail service was exceptional !  Always had a drink on my hand.  Wonderful !

During our stay we also saw le reve which was awesome !   Highly recommend watching the show if you've never seen it !  Best of all it's just a short walk !  Since it's connected to the hotel we were able to dress up for the show and not worry about the terrible heat outside.

Our room had a connecting door but we never heard the neighbors at all.  Only thing we ever heard actually was just the door but that's only  because all the doors here are large and heavy. Our room was facing the pool/ strip and the front desk did warn us it would be loud at night.  I had no problem sleeping at night but my bf did so if your a light sleeper definitely bring ear plugs. Not sure if it was just this time but the air being pumped into the casino/hotel wasn't scented which is no big deal really but I always love it when a hotel smells nice.  The pool was alright ..  a bit small.  Definitely more of a place to socialize than to swim.  They play music but it's very low.  I guess maybe the keeps the crowds down?   The pool was busy but plenty of space to not feel crammed

Housekeeping!  You are fantastic!   Late in the day we called to have our room made up and usually at other hotels it will take hours and hours before anyone shows up (if at all) but to our delight the room was made up super fast !  We called housekeeping as we were walking out to gamble and maybe two hours later we came back up to get ready for a show and everything had been put back into place !  Chocolates and slippers were left beside with a cute little note AND she found my ring !  Could not have been happier.  

As great as our experience was there was only one thing that fell short.  On our last night we stayed up too late so we called front desk and inquired if we could pay for the late check out or add an additional night if that wasn't available.  Front desk was polite but states that they were fully booked and couldnt accommodate my request.  Ok no problem.  My fault anyway for staying up too late n all.  Later that evening while having lunch I decided to check online just for kicks to see if they were fully booked since I thought it was odd being that it was a Sunday and sure enough they have rooms available.   Worst yet was because it was a Sunday the rate was very affordable.  So that was a let down.  Really wanted to stay another day to just chill and gamble.",5
2286,"I lived in Manhattan and the Bronx for a time and after moving back to the west coast I starved for something to fill my New York Style Pizza Needs! Then a few months ago we were told about this joint. 

ITS
INCREDIBLE!

Everything I have tried here is divine. I love the pizza. It is the closest to how I had it in NYC. But the thing that blew my mind were the cannolis. They were just like I had them from my favorite little bakery in the Bronx. They fill them right in front of you so you know they are legit. And the cool thing is if you get the trivia question right on their chalkboard you get a free one!! 

The service is great! They are usually pretty busy but you are having so much fun waiting you don't even notice. 

O and I cannot explain how excited I am that a eatery as great as this one is in NORTH LAS VEGAS! 

Needless to say I am in love! I crave this place more than any other. I want it right now in fact... :D",5

Once again satisfied 01/25/18 THANKS ROSIE!",5
2288,"I love this place, there's only a few options but you can get him a few different ways and no matter what you get it tastes fantastic there's a small sit-down area outside and no bathrooms so make sure you use it before you come. Anytime I find myself even remotely close to Ritos I make the detour to come over here and get some food.",5
2289,"Delicious! The food came early and was super hot still! We ordered fried wontons, crab angels, wonton soup, egg drop soup and almond chicken.

Expected the standard food in cardboard boxes and lukewarm at best. What we got was in plastic containers, super hot, and delivered ahead of schedule!!! Thoroughly impressed to say the least.

Everything was delicious. The soup had flavor. They included the extra spices I asked for. The fillings on the wontons and crab angels were all flavorful as well (and real meat in the wontons, not just fried wraps!).

It was so good, that I just ordered from here again tonite!",5
2290,"Absolutely incredible. Robert went above and beyond for our wedding on 3/22/2014. We had a backyard wedding at my parents home in Mesa, AZ. Robert transformed the yard and entire house into a beautiful, dream wedding. He came to the house three times to help us design the table layouts for the backyard reception, indoor cocktails, and even decor for the front yard and patio. He helped my wedding vision come to life! I just wanted to say thank you from the bottom of my heart. You made our wedding absolutely amazing. Thank you for all the extra time and effort. The food!! Everyone died over the food. He created a custom menu for us! And the cakes!! Still enjoying every last bite of leftovers. Absolutely the best I've ever eaten. You are truly an artist and I am so thankful for you. Your crew and service was impeccable. Thank you thank you!!",5
2291,"We saw Lavo on the the Food Porn show. They were showing how they make their famous meatball. It looked so good on the show that the next time in Las Vegas we had to try it. Oh my, it is the best meatball I have ever eaten. It is 1 pound of meaty goodness. The rest of the meal was also very good, but it is the meatball that is the main attraction. Great service and big portions.",5
2292,"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon Bistro Florin on Grand Prix weekend.  We had tried to get into O'Thym without a reservation, but failed and were wandering.  We noticed this cute place (very new at the time) and found that it had a great outdoor seating area in the back of the restaurant.  

The staff was amazing.  They spoke both French and English and we believe the owner is from France

We started with drinks and an appetizer.  I had a nice white wine.  We had  an escargot in a puff pastry - to die for!  My main was a grilled salmon with veggies.  The fish was perfectly cooked and dressed with a tasty (but fattening) French buttery sauce.  We split desert.

We left a few hours later after having a leisurely dinner and completely satisfied.  If I lived in Montreal, I'd be here much more often.  I look forward to going back and hope it stays around for many years!",5
2293,"Good service. Good food. Love their happy hour menu. This is place is better than Monta, but not sure why it's less busy.",5
2296,"This was our first time at this restaurant.  We had carry out for four.  My wife picked up the food and she commented on how nice the staff was to her. 

We ordered 2 egg rolls, egg drop soup, General Tso's chicken, beef with snow peas, sesame chicken and chicken with cashews.  

The food was great.  Everyone was very happy with the portion sizes, quality and the nice food containers, which were very nice for left over storage.  

When we eat Chinese it will definitely be at Lotus Cafe.  We highly recommend this restaurant.",5
2297,"This is our favorite bar!!! It is located in the basement of winking lizard and has the same food as them. 
The staff is friendly and incredibly knowledgable about all of their beers and whiskey! They always have my favorite gluten free beer in stock and it only takes two mins to chill it with their nifty beer chiller! 
It is quiet and seems to aim for you to have a conversation, which is why we love it! (We're very chatty humans!) 
My fianc√© adores the selection of whiskey a and bourbons and always looks forward to trying new ones! 
Our only complaint is no Sunday or Monday hours and we miss them on those days!!!",5
2299,"Shattered my iPhone 6 when it fell off a machine at the gym and landed screen down on a metal square part of assisted pull up machine shattering the screen. I did have a case on it but no case would help the way this landed. 
I do have insurance on my phone but didn't want to deal with reloading everything on a replacement refurbished phone that they would have replaced it with. 
I looked at a few places and most were 129-150 bucks to replace the glass. Ubreakit was 109 + tax to replace the screen. They were super nice and had my phone done in an hr. They had good reviews which is why I decided to try them out. 
It was cheaper than going thru the insurance I have on my phone and didn't have to get a refurbished phone and reload all my stuff. I will absolutely use them again if the need arises.",5

Their speciality sauce is also bad and smells horrible.",1
2302,"My girlfriends and I came here after having a blast at Marquee Day Club. I swear the line was long, but I guess when you're drunk.. time goes by a little faster. I had the famous WHITE PIZZA and was DELISHHH! I wish I got 2 slices! I like how it has a hallway entrance without signs or anything! Walking back to the hotel room, people were asking us where we got the slices and telling them it's at ""secret pizza"" was the best! haha",5

Not only because of this great third floor bar, but because of the wonderful Italian restaurant on the second floor (just take the elevator back down to entry floor and walk up the stairs to 2). Loved the appetizers and the craft beers on tap, hard cider options and wine - everyone can order their favorite drink here. 
I cannot wait to visit again especially in the summer when the roof is open. Even in early Oct with the roof closed, this unique space made for a perfect start to a special bday celebration. Service was great too!",5
2306,"Heard this place from my cousin. She said there's a new place in the neighborhood that has Korean skin products for cheap! AND SHE WAS RIGHT! 
Came in looking for something to brighten my face because we just came from our vacation and we're totally sunburned :( the girl was so nice! She recommended everything for us and was so helpful and patient everytime we asked something. She also gave us 2 free sheet mask for checking in, so make sure you sign in through Yelp. 

They also have cute clothes for reasonable prices. Like forever 21 price. I had to get out of there before I buy everything lol! I will definitely be coming back. Grabbed myself a black whitening mask & lemon peel off gel.",5
2309,"Came here with a soon to be groom later today for a last lunch! Outside bar was really cool near the water, good music and the bartender Barrie was great! I loved the ribeye tacos and tried the chicken tacos as well...no one was disappointed with their food. Loved this place",5
2312,"This place is amazing for their lunch buffet! I love their mango chicken and banana cake! I'm not sure if it's just the food or what, but the Pepsi seems to taste different. In a good way, though. I usually hate Pepsi. The environment of the place is really relaxed. I love going here.",5

But with some consistency,  strict meal planning and sticking to a tight schedule, I was able to lose a total of 20.6 pounds, The Camps trainers are beyond amazing... , they are a TRUE inspiration to keep me going and motivate me to push myself to the next level. I know this is weight loss journey, is not an overnight process, it takes a lot of dedication, true commitment, sore achy muscles, sweat and channeling your inner beast. I look forward to my next 6- week challenge.... #trusttheprocess #sticktotheplan #dontstop",5

We dined last night, I had the fish which was absolute mush, the Cesar salad which I would sometimes have for dessert it was so good, I didn't finish, and the creme br√ªl√©e was like pudding.  The service was terrible, the poor gal had obviously had no training.. We got our salads before our drinks.. The place is screaming we don't care anymore.  Very sad because the ambience is so great!!",1

2325,"I have never had such a hard time with a company in my LIFE. Run as fast as you can from them if you want to spare yourself the headache. I ordered a grill from them back in August then came to the realization that I did not want to do business with them because something seemed fishy. I trusted my gut and I was right, I called them and contacted them so many different ways but this company ignored me until they could claim that I never canceled my order. Now I have a big headache of a dispute that I have to deal with for ALOT of money. They are not a fair honest company and they do not want to communicate. they're a scummy company who just wants your money in exchange for faulty products.",1

2327,"I scheduled online on a Wednesday for duct service cleaning for Friday. I received an email stating it was confirmed and the email stated they would try to work with my scheduling needs. I did not receive any sort of confirmation call to confirm or advise of the time window. I called on a Thursday and the rep told me they called me but I did not receive a message. The rep advised my window would be between 2:30-5:30 and I would be called 30 mins prior to the technician arriving. Around 5 on Friday I called to see if they were on their way. The rep answered and said he would call the technician.After 30 mins he called me back and said he had just gotten in touch with him and they were still on the job. He said I could either reschedule with 10 percent off or wait for them to come. I decided to reschedule for the following day, and he said he could fit me in as priority. I assumed priority meant first. The next day rolls around, no call. I call about 3 and the rep stated my window was between 2:30-5:30. Lovely... 5:30 rolls around and again no call so I call them and once again she couldn't get a hold of the tech and says ""I assume it because he's busy."" I told her to just cancel the service and she says ""yah I apologize."" Thanks for your apology but I still have two wasted days of waiting around for a tech and dirty ducts. I typically go with Sears for carpet cleaning, that was for next week, but no thanks.",1
2328,"IMPRESSED.
Via Rail made everything easy. From booking online to sending the electronic ticket to arriving at the station to the experience on the train -- all A+.
I booked a business class ticket from Montreal to Quebec City online about a month before my trip. Super easy online. I also upgraded to business class because I figured the seats would be better, but the experience was well worth it as well!
No line waiting at the terminal, special lobby, and easy to get on the train. And on the train, a meal and friendly service. I was delighted with the comfort, the ease, and the beautiful ride.",5
2329,"I am very picky where I get my nails done because I have gotten many infections from different nail salons. After looking in on the place after they had close and reading all of the reviews I thought I would give it a shot. 

It was the best nail salon I have EVER been to. The staff was so friendly and sweet. They really took care of me went I went in. I cant wait to go again and bring my mom.

I will recommend them to everyone I know :)",5
2330,Great beer selection good happy hour specials. Skip the places inside New York New York and come here. Shuffle board and games at the table great value and fun way to spend some time. Make sure to ask for Agata she is the best!!! Great knowledge about the beer and she is fun to talk to!!!! Any restaurant would be lucky to have an employee like this.,5
2333,"The Pizza is terrific !  Great tasting and seems like high quality ingredients. I had just eaten Fioris pizza a couple days prior. Eveyone says Fioris is some of the best pizza in Pittsburgh. To me, the Pizza from Home Plate was better!!  I like a like bit of crunch to my pizza too and this pizza has that too. I will definitely order again.",5
2334,Probably one of the few spots I really enjoyed seeing during the day. Great photo opportunities!!,5
2336,"I think the only reason I haven't written a review for Roberto's is that I try so hard to pretend that it doesn't exist.

(This location is now known as Don Tortaco, although the staff told me - at least I think they did, through the muttering - that it's the same as Roberto's. I know that nothing has changed menu-wise or decor-wise.)

I've been to this Roberto's/Don Tortaco's three times. The first time was about five years ago. I had the cheese enchiladas. They were like a nasty gravy with two lumps of cheese log. My mouth felt all gaggy not long after eating them. Shoot, there go my dreams of 24/7 Mexican right around the corner.

""No, you have to try the burritos!"" 

That's what everyone said. But my first experience was so bad that I wasn't going to risk another visit, and I'm not really a fan of places where people make excuses for the food based on the one thing the restaurant (supposedly) does well.

Years passed. I finally had a burrito at another Roberto's. It was more or less inoffensive. More or less. Hmm. Okay.

Encouraged, two weeks ago I had a (bean and cheese) burrito at this location, and it was... okay. I could see eating it in a lazy moment... if it were quite late and I was quite tired and I was very hungry, and in this case all of these factors were present. The burrito lacked any fresh ingredients at all, but for the price, no surprise, and there is a sort of salad bar with salsa, whole spring onions (?), carrots, and so forth with sandwich bags and little plastic cups if you want to dress your takeaway up. Wilty and grubby, but something.

So, a week ago I found myself in similar tired/late/hungry circumstances, so I popped down the street for another burrito, cheese enchiladas, and a bean tostada. (The last item alone took several minutes to order as the staff seemed to have as hard a time conveying information in English as receiving it.) I figured that since the burrito wasn't so awful last time, I'd give everything a chance.

The look of the cheese enchiladas has vastly improved. The taste has, too, but it still wasn't good. I had three or four bites before I asked myself what the heck I was doing and stopped.

The bean tostada was composed of possibly the grossest tortilla-based product I've ever put in my mouth. The tostada shell was chewy, like a Rice Krispies treat, and covered in what I will call ""bean-based muck."" A little shredded lettuce was sprinkled over that. I'm not sure how I got to the second bite, but I certainly went no further.

And the burrito was just like someone had scraped some room temperature refried beans straight from a can onto a day-old tortilla.... except not that good. Again, two bites. One to taste, and one more to confirm that indeed all three items I'd ordered were just plain yucky.

I got to think about this a lot the next day, when I stayed home from work to catch up on my sleep, what with having been up all night in porcelain-based penance for those eight bites.

I'm never eating here again. Why? There's a grocery store right across the street. Forget tired/hungry/late - I will never be so lazy to eat food this bad again.",1
2338,I love this place and the team work all the servers do to help one another can't  wait to eat here again,5

Die Begr√º√üung war wie immer sehr herzlich. Wir hatten freie Tischwahl und wurden auch sofort bedient.Nachdem wir uns bei der Weinwahl nicht ganz sicher waren wurden wir nach unseren W√ºnschen sehr gut beraten. Nach sehr kurzer Wartezeit auf unsere Getr√§nke, wurden die Speisen aufgenommen.Zur Vorspeise( wir hatten gegrillte Pepperonie und Knoblauchbrot, sowie einen zum Hauptgang √ºblichen Salat) wurde uns eisgek√ºhlter Ouzo servieret. Allein schon die Vorspeise war eine Freude f√ºr den Gaumen !!
Zu den Hauptg√§ngen: diesmal hatten wir uns f√ºr den Lammr√ºcken im Pf√§nnchen entschieden, und es war ein Traum. Der Lammr√ºcken war zart, rosa gebraten, saftig in einer sehr geschmackvollen So√üe. Auch die anderen Hauptg√§nge k√∂nnen wir als Stammg√§ste sehr empfehlen !!!!
Wer hier essen geht, sollte Hunger mitbringen, da Qualit√§t und Quantit√§t in einem super Verh√§ltniss stehen.
Das ""Ouzo"" macht seinem Namen alle Ehre, denn an Ouzo mangelte es nie.

2350,"WARNING!!! DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY FOR ANY PURPOSE!!!

AA Auto Care - Previously Purrfect Auto - name changed I would guess because of poor service, bad reviews and horrible management to name but a few things that I have experienced. Now AA Auto Care.  Well nothing changed but the name and a few of the employees (including some management).

In all due respect, the workers there were friendly.  Even the owner, who I talked to several times about my issues gave me the impression he wanted to do the right thing by me - yet the management wouldn't.  This leads me to believe it was ALL LIP SERVICE!

It is important that you know... This business under both names lied to me, to date fail to follow up and satisfy the work I overpaid for even under warrantee they refuse to do the proper work.
Explain:  I negotiated to have a rebuilt motor put in my car.  They quoted me one price and charged me over $700 more.  Out of desperation and the fact that without consulting me first they put the engine they claimed was rebuilt in the car.   This took months to fulfil so I was very ready and in need of my car.

It only gets worse.... During the subsequent YEAR I have fought with AA Auto et al about this issue, the car has NEVER operated properly, has all kinds of new issues, I've discovered that the engine is a USED engine with many miles on it, leaks oil, has a bad noise, also discovered that my original transmission was stolen and replaced with one from U Pull It (still has the markings on it from that business).

Also during one of the many times they held my car for weeks on end, my tool box with tools that were given to me by my Dad who is now dead was stolen from my car.
After much patience on my part and mere lip service and poor workmanship on theirs, the car still does NOT run and they have refused to honor the warranty yet told me I was ""too demanding"" when I wanted the car to run properly.  

I was event threatened by the man who I was told was there to 'handle complaints.'  He basically attempted to get me to fight him at one of their locations on Craig Road.  Yes, I have witnesses...

This is the most frustrating of all things!  I don't know what to do other than to contact an attorney (which I am in the process of giving all the paperwork and records I've keep) and now to write a WARNING to anyone who is thinking about doing work with this company.

WARNING I have personally witnessed AA Auto sell services that were not needed to people who came in while I was waiting there.  I heard the conversations before and after such sales and it is pure thievery what they do.

In CONCLUSION: Horrible workmanship, Theft of Parts and Personal Items, Failure to honor Warranty, and threats of physical harm when confronting them about what they promised they would do!",1

2352,Thai House is my absolute fave for Thai. I always get the Red Curry with Jasmine rice as it's the healthiest item on the menu. I wouldn't consider this a health food obviously but it is coconut milk based and at least a healthy calorie along with the not so awesome high calorie part. It comes to $11 and change for a meal and it's 2 generous servings. You can get a spice level of 1-5 and I just get a 1 or 2 as I don't care for spicy. I'm always surprised with how quickly they prepare take out orders as they are packed every time I stop in to pick up. I've tried all of the Thai spots in North Scottsdale and this is now the only one I will go to. Delish!,5

2364,"Bel√©m Caf√© & Yoga est (presque litt√©ralement!) un havre de paix situ√© sur le boulevard Saint-Laurent. Le concept d'un cours de yoga accompagn√© d'un caf√©, d'un th√© et/ou de diff√©rents bols (d'a√ßa√Ø, de c√©r√©ales, etc.) est bien pens√© et ex√©cut√©. La d√©coration (compos√©e de statues de Bouddha, de livres sur la cuisine v√©g√©talienne, de plantes, etc.) ainsi que la sympathie et les sourires du personnel contribuent √©galement beaucoup √† l'ambiance chaleureuse du caf√©. On s'y sent bien!
M√™me si vous n'avez pas la chance de participer √† une s√©ance de yoga, faites-vous une faveur et profitez d'une des boissons (le caf√© est excellent mais il y a aussi, entre autres, un matcha latte!) et/ou d'un bol. D'ailleurs, le bol d'a√ßa√Ø est la sp√©cialit√© du Bel√©m (et vous garantit une photo Instagram r√©ussie et trendy!). Les prix sont abordables, surtout consid√©rant √† quel point les items propos√©s sont nourrissants et bons pour la sant√©.

2366,"I sent my Akita puppy, Kita, at about 5 months to Willie 2 week Board and Training program. Prior to her advance training in May 2018, Willie provided puppy lessons to complement her training she would be getting in May. I booked it in advance. 

The puppy lessons helped. Willie showed me how to get my puppy used to walking on a leash, recall, sit, and turning. When it came time to drop my puppy off to Willie, I knew she would be in great hands. In about 10 days my puppy was moving through the training program. By the 12th day I picked her up. 

During the training program, Willie was easily available via text message.  He sent me videos of her progress and quickly responded to my questions. 

Willie spent about 2 hours with me to learn how to continue my training with my puppy. We walked through the various commands and I had a chance to practice with my puppy with Willie guiding me.  To see how my puppy has transformed has been amazing. She was always a good puppy but I could tell she will be a little stubborn the older she got. 

Willie and I will continue to work together on the next visit. He will check up on Kita to make sure I'm doing good training with Kita. 

Willie knows what he is doing and understands the various dog breeds.  Willie said I can reach out to him any time on my training with Kita. He has been amazing! Plus, they wash your dog before they give it back to you. 

I found the Board and Training program absolutely a great investment in my puppy. I recommend it!",5
2368,crazy enough I don't eat meat but yes I ate here. The chef made me a sandwich with fries and coleslaw in between the waffles and omg it was delicious!!!,5
2369,"I initially signed up with the LA Fitness on McKnight Rd since the day it opened. For convenience, I've been going to the Bakery Square LA Fitness as well until recently, they stopped me and said that since this is a signature club, I will have to pay $10 more per month and also an additional $166 fee. What?!

When I asked the manager if she could explain the differences between the 2 clubs (with me already well aware of the differences) she explained the following:

-The equipment is new and more updated...WRONG. McKnight road has MUCH newer equipment.
-There are racquetball courts and a basketball court. WRONG. There is ONE racquetball court and a 1/2 sized basketball court. McKnight Road has 5 and a full sized basketball court.
-Free Towel Service (OK-this is really convenient)
-Movie cardio room (Does anyone even use this)?

I understand paying the additional $10/month since it's technically a ""signature"" club,  but I will NEVER pay another $166 fee on top of that to downgrade, I mean ""upgrade."" After telling her that I've been an LA Fitness member for 4 years and asking her why I have to pay this fee since I already paid an initiaiton fee, she simply stated that I must pay it and there's nothing she can do. I asked her so you'd rather lose a customer than waive or at the very least reduce this fee? She said ""Yeah, I guess."" I laughed and just said thank you I will be canceling my membership with LA Fitness. She said Okay, that's fine. 

That's one hell of a manager!!",1

2373,"This establishment is amazing. Definitely one of my favorites and go to restaurants. 

I've celebrated my birthday there for the past 2 years (among other special occasions). 

The waitstaff, bartenders, and host staff are friendly, courteous, and always on point. The waitstaff and bartenders are very attentive and knowledgable. 

I have never been disappointed with the food. The menu frequently updates and the food is always prepared perfectly. I recently had a special, the bone in filet, it was so delicious. My photo does not do it justice. The fried pickles are amazing, the bone marrow, the ribeye, pretty much everything on the menu. They always have a great selection of beer as well. 

Definitely one of the best places around, if you have not been, I suggest you go!",5
2374,"I've been here a couple of times over the last two weeks and have not been happy with the quality at this location.

Food:
It's okay.  I've had better northern Chinese cuisine uptown, and it still doesn't compare to my favourite place, Ningtu, in Vancouver.  The portion sizes are small and especially disappointing when we order from a set menu for 10 people and it probably was good for 6-8.  The two lobsters looked like all the pieces weren't there.  Even the e-fu noodle dish was small and rice and noodles are usually fairly large in quantity given they're the ""filler"".  

The worst was that we ordered Peking Duck as a substitute, and when the lettuce wrap part came, they didn't have enough lettuce wrap for the whole table (i.e. less than 1 leaf per person seated and we were around 8).  We ordered more and they CHARGED US for the extra lettuce.  

Their red bean pancake was good though, but don't order the red bean in meringue.  They didn't turn out well (oily and dense vs. fluffy and light).

Service:
Restaurant wasn't busy and service was still slow and not attentive.  It seems they aren't used to doing ""banquet"" dinners because they were slow at clearing plates, getting drinks, cutlery, etc.

Needless to say, I will not be coming back here again despite its proximity to me.",1
2377,"If you desire a blast-from-the-past 70s/80s experience combined with super cocktail offerings, visit this spot and stay a while. You'll feel transported to the sets of That 70s Show and Freaks and Geeks but furnished with dope booze. Chris served us a G&T and a Dalmore 15. He did an excellent job and appears enthusiastic about bartending.
We'll be back to try some cocktails and say hello to Chris G, Vedo, and Alex. I'm sure they're rocking it here.",5
2378,"This place has been here forever it seems. I visit this shopping plaza quite often, and I'm mad I never stopped in here earlier! We tried their breakfast. I had the country fried steak and eggs and my companion had banana crunch pancakes. Everything came out fresh and was cooked perfectly. The servers are very friendly and attentive. My only negative would be the decor. It needs an update.",5
2379,"My wife and daughter took me to StripSteak in the Mandalay Bay hotel as a Father's Day gift and oh what  gift it was. 

I've appreciated Michael Mina's flair with food for well over a decade now, even going back to his days as Exec Chef at Aqua in San Francisco. With StripSteak he has elevated the steak eating experience to the level of the top 1% of steak restaurants in the country. 

Restaurant: Warm, well decorated and easy to access from the parking garage or the hotel rooms. I also found the noise level to be very moderate. 

Food: 3 seasoned choices of duck fat fried French fries were the free starter we enjoyed with 3 amazing dips to go with them. Very good! 
My daughter and I ordered the Hamachi crispy rice starter. The flavors were amazing, presentation was good and all very fresh. 
My wife ordered the Sweet Corn soup and we all had a taste (she's vegetarian), and it was fantastic, possibly the best corn based soup I've ever had. 
The main course... My daughter ordered the Wagyu 8oz Filet and I ordered the World Wide Wagyu. The Wagyu filet was cooked rare and was really amazing. Easily compares with the top 5-6 steaks I've ever eaten. No sauce, no rub, just amazing and perfectly cooked beef. Truly fantastic. My World Wide Wagyu had a trio of meat, Wagyu tenderloin, short rib, and rib cap. My least favorite was the short rib, I'm not really a short rib guy, the rib cap was amazing but the tenderloin moved right up into the top 1-3 pieces of steak I've ever eaten. If I could have married that steak, I would have called for a justice of the peace right there. 
My wife had the special with an excellent Ravioli over a bed of perfectly cooked veggies. Very, very good. 

Dessert was a trio of ""dips"" with beignets. The first dip was a cream brulee, the 2nd a chocolate moose and the 3rd a McCallan infused butterscotch (Scotch with Butterscotch). All of the items were amazing. 

We will definitely be back.",5
2380,"My recommendations on vegas a whole:

The hot clubs right now are LAX at Luxor, XS at Encore, Vanity at Hardrock, and Pure and Tao are always good. I personally HATE Jet at the Mirage. Its small and there is no where to sit. oh ya and it turned in to gangsterville. DO NOT go there.

As for buffets my personal fave has been the Mirage buffet. The Paris one is also tasty since it has all the french pastries you can eat and also crab legs. They offered bottomless mimosas too on Sundays I think.

If you are looking for a tastie lunch spot there is a place called ""terrace point cafe"" right next the buffet at the Wynn. There are sky lights everywhere so its all open and pretty. The sliders are good and I had the cobb salad too.

One of my favorite things to do is play beer pong at O Shea's and go to Earl of Sandwich. If you have not been to the Peppermill YOU MUST GO!! Best BLT ever and the bloody marys are AMAZING. 

I also love Downtown Freemont. The drinks are 10x cheaper than the strip and you can take the bus for $4.00, but you have to have exact change.

Gambling is the same everywhere. Slots of fun is the cheapest other then downtown.",5
2381,I am a first time dog owner so I was worried about this experience on getting my pup nurtured. I didn't know how he was going to feel or react but the staff was sure to answer all my questions and I felt safe dropping off my pup. The staff gave me a warm welcoming and they were super friendly. When I picked up my dog I was sent home with medication and instructions. I was expecting a quiet evening for my dog to recover from surgery but it was the complete opposite. He came home and acted like his normal energetic self- except with a cone that kept bumping into me. It's now been 14 days since his surgery and he is doing better then ever!!,5

I even googled well drinks because the lady helping us didn't seem to even know and even then she was like nope.. okay then, I ended up getting a Long Island iced tea and leaving. Don't worry that's a common well drink but not here.. paid full price for it and then left.",1

We have 2 older cats (one is extremely shy) and they both have specific dietary requirements. This was not a problem for Rachel and during our first meeting, she made very detailed notes about their care and emailed me afterwards to confirm that she had properly understood everything. I really appreciated this as well as the updates she provided daily while we were away for just over a week. It is obvious Rachel really loves cats and is passionate about providing top quality care. Her daily fee is not cheap but she is more than worth it. I will definitely contact Rachel again when we're looking for someone to care for our cats while we're traveling. I strongly recommend her to anyone looking for a true pet care professional who really cares about providing a positive experience to pets while their humans are away.",5

2392,"It's Tuesday and you're hungry! 

After a long and hot day at the Las Vegas Comic Con, I was hungry for tacos and wanted a chilly IPA in my hand, Tacos and Beer, I see you. First off, the outside is pretty deceiving, like most Las Vegas ""snackateria's"" it's located in a strip mall with a plain look and minimal signage, but when you walk-in it's dark, cool (temp wise) and has clean rustic-hipster look. I'm sold already. 

I went with two tacos; a Fish Taco and the Pork al Pastor plus, chips and salsa, and bacon wrapped jalapenos. The Tacos were amazing, the al Pastor was super tender and the pineapple chunks went with the avocado cream sauce perfectly, great sweet and savory combo. The Fish taco was not fried, but grilled which sometimes can lack in flavor, but this time around that was not the case. Flaky fish, habanero-mango salsa, and cilantro, boom. Definitely a good choice if you're looking for ""lighter"" taco option. 

The Bacon-wrapped Jalape√±os were huge and stuffed with cream cheese and came with a guajillo chili sauce. These were a hit it on all cylinders for me, even if it meant I would be paying for it later on in bathroom. 

The service was fast and our waiter knew the beer menu very well, he even mentioned a few beers that weren't on the list, but were still available. If you haven't been here yet, the beer list is pretty extensive, so for him to memorize the entire beer wall menu and know the taps was pretty impressive. 

Tacos and Beer, You have made your namesake proud",5
2393,"This is our State Street tradition. Perfect for before a show at Overture and we'll worth the wait on a Farmer's Market Saturday.

2394,"Amateur hour as far as management and staff.

We had someone at the table with a shellfish allergy, which was announced, and both the kitchen and service staff mixed the order, which almost ended very, very badly.  The only thing they offered for their extreme mistake, was a bottle of wine.  That's just not what someone who has just medicated themselves should be offered.  Oh yeah, they didn't comp the dumplings that almost killed the person.  Not even kidding.

Anyway, the food was ok.  Some good (duck salad) and some bad (dumplings, hot and sour soup and smoked short rib, which was really quite terrible).

Expect to pay more than you should, and if you have any allergies at all, I just wouldn't trust these folks with your well-being.  Hope that helps.",1
2395,"This place is amazing. They have accommodated 3 of my request now. Although my orders are smaller than typical ones they have never made me feel less such as other companies have. I have always received quick email responses and products. They look amazing and for my personal events (gifts, Bachelorette, etc). They truly provide the best work around! I would recommend this company to anyone! ;)",5

Enterprise is the above the others, try them...",5
2397,"If you are looking for a super affordable buffet that has actually good food (and not only just a wide variety of food), come here. 

We walked by this place while going around the casino. We stayed in the Palms Place so we were really close to here. An Uber driver recommended this place to us. And, based on my experience, when a local Uber driver recommends a place, you at least check it out.

The staff were super friendly and let us do a quick walk around before purchasing a buffet. We looked, we smelled, we got in line.

We stayed for the breakfast buffet, so I can only speak about that, but for about $10ish dollars a person, we couldn't believe that the food could be that good. I'm so glad we were wrong.

I usually think of buffets as ""a bunch of average food that makes up for the average taste with the overwhelmingly quantity"". This one, however, has a huge variety AND tastes great AND is super affordable. Seriously, this may be the best breakfast buffet I've ever had.

Overall, because of the clean environment, classy decor, tasty food, wide variety of food, friendly staff, & extremely affordable price, I'd say it's worth a shot. 

Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if their prices go up soon. This is easily a $30-40/person buffet at a $10ish price. 

The only question I have for you now is: Will you be able to try all the foods you want to try here before you get full?

2406,Excellent customer service the food was AMAZING!! If you like BBQ this is a must try restaurant. Pricing was good. I had the pulled pork and my husband got the chopped brisket plate. The meat was tender and lean.,5
2407,"Yes to all of the above.  Woodlands is simply fantastic.

Though we'd been wanting to try it for a while, we hadn't trekked out to Woodlands simply because it was (in our eyes) all the way out in the boonies off Albemarle Road.  Despite growing up in the CLT, I can count on one hand the times I have actually driven on Albemarle Road (imagine my surprise then, when we passed the old Eastland Mall, and I was all, ""OHHHH... THIS is where Eastland used to be"").  ANYWAY.

Last night, however, searching for a restaurant that wasn't participating in Restaurant Week, we decided to head out to Woodlands, and we were pleasantly surprised when it took us less than 15 minutes to get out there.  Excellent.  Despite previous reviews, the exterior and decor weren't particularly off-putting... it seems to me that almost every great Indian place I've eaten at has a very similar set-up (Udipi in Cary, anyone?), so it felt like home.

I do love opening a menu and knowing I can order anything off it.  This time, I settled on the chef's specialty of chana batura, and husband ordered aloo gobi and garlic naan.  The puffy bread with my dish was like a light, unsweetened funnel cake - fried, indulgent deliciousness - and it sopped up the chana so very well.  The chana were perfect.  Husband's aloo gobi was so delicate and tasty, and the garlic naan just blew me away.  Yum to absolutely everything.  We also ordered a couple samosas, which were also perfect... just the right amount of spice, and flaky beyond belief.

The service was excellent, for what it's worth. 

Although we've got Maharani around the corner (which I like very much), as well as Copper (which underwhelms me, despite all its hoopla), I imagine we'll be making the well-worth-it drive out to Woodlands when we're in the mood for particularly fabulous Indian food.  Love this place.",5

You come to expect a certain quality of food in the fast food industry and when a fast food joint can't meet that benchmark, well then you have a problem.  Ultimately we just stopped going to this Wendy's.  Then they started their new menu with new meat and ect.  I hadn't had Wendy's for a while so, I actually went to the one close to my work in Henderson.  The one over on Green Valley Ranch.  I came home that day and told my wife that Wendy's tastes a lot better now!  So, she wanted to see for herself.  We went to this Wendy's and it was so bad! I just don't understand why it's so terrible.  They can't seem to get orders right and when they do it's terrible.  I got a spicy chicken and they put a ton of mayo and it was just bad!

Ever since I started listening to Boys II Men back in the 90's, from Cassette tapes, CD's and now iTunes. I've fallen in love with their soft harmonies, acapellas, and NO AUTO TUNE! 

Cough* Cough** Brittney Spears...

It's located in the Terry Fator Theater located pass the Mirage elevators, through the mall and near the convention center, phew! That's a good 10 minute exercise just from the casino. The showroom feels very intimate compared to large venues like Celine Dion and there are no bad seats in the house. I grew up listening to Boys II Men in school and till this day they still sound the same, plus, ""No Lip Synching!"" This shows how much talent they have and aren't fake with some music artist and still value their long term fans. =) 

Unfortunately, one of the members has retired (Michael McCary - Due to back problems and personal issues) the group now performs as a trio and has remained strong without the 4th member. They even admit, it's hard to perform some of their songs without Michael McCary, they are still strong in my book. 

Throughout their performance, they through some jokes, showed some hilarious Youtube videos of their fans singing their famous songs and passed out roses when they sang their song, ""Ill Make Love to You."" I'm just glad to have seen Boys II Men before they fully retire and can't wait to see them a second time. 

TIP** They allow pictures and video cameras throughout the show!",5
2432,"Cool concept, the nitrogen and all. Definitely draws in kiddos and long lines. Very limited amount of space inside. The product itself however, was extremely overpriced and not very good. You don't exactly know what you're buying unless you ask. There aren't really any signs to say that you're about to purchase cereal puffs. From what you can tell, you're buying nitrogen infused balls of something and it looks like you're blowing smoke out of your nose and mouth when you eat it. It's not very tasty, we ate a couple puffs and then we were over it. Threw more than half of it away, paid over $7 for it too. Also, not sure how they can label themselves an ice cream shop (on other sites like google and Facebook), it's certainly not ice cream. Definitely will not be going back.

Mary takes the time to get to know you and provides excellent advice through conversation, literature, and real life experiences. In the past, I've tried Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers and other ""diets."" Seeing a dietitian has worked better for me so far. I would recommend Mary & Anders & Dunaway if you are looking to make a lifestyle change.",5
2443,"Terrible service, took the car back, everything fine at first. They later told me there was 400 dollars worth of damages . Filled out forms, dealt with idiot, got irritated, etc...Then sent me a bill for 45 dollars worth of damages . Now disputing that out of principal. Terrible management. If you want the wrong car at the wrong price with a bunch of bs mixed in than these are your folks!",1
2445,Great food and service. This restaurant was exceptional. All that we ordered was great. their drinks were fabulous too.,5
2450,"They are wonderful. I will never have anyone else clean my carpets. The were very thorough. Did a great job. On top of that, they were some of the nicest people I've ever met. Great service.",5
2453,"What a great place in all aspects! The atmosphere is energetic, but not so much as to be a distraction.  

Service was excellent throughout, from the moment we arrived until we bid a good night. Penny was our primary server and she met our every need, even anticipating a few. The staff works well as a team and contribute a great deal to the successful operation of Deville.

The front room has the main bar and some tables. The back of the restaurant is up a half flight of stairs.  The kitchen is half a flight down and you can get a good view of the action as you go to your table.

The decor is delightful - modern diner elements are tastefully merged into a comfortable and vibrant atmosphere. 

The menu is based on traditional diner comfort food, but often with a modern touch.  Being in Montreal, we had to try the Disco Poutine. The fries were hot, thin, and crispy and the Disco gravy paired very well for this variation. 

I had a burger with cheese and bacon. The sandwich was of considerable size and I had to resort to fork and knife halfway through. 

My friend had the hanger steak special and it was majestically presented on a wood butcher block with an impressive mashed potato side.  He was quite impressed with the taste and quality of the steak.

As a treat, I ordered a strawberry shake (or frappe as we call it in New England). Very well-made and flavorful. It was presented in a traditional style ice cream fountain glass complete with a metal frame handle. 

Thank you, Penny & staff, for a delightful evening.",5
2455,"Wow, really really bad!

I have ordered from here for years and it is inconsistent at best. I love Lemon Chicken and when this place does it good its great!  The last 3 times it has been terrible. The delivery is slow and this time it was so slow that it was cold, nothing worse than cold Lemon Chicken and the sauce was lumpy! Yuck.",1
2456,"I love this breakfast restaurant. It usually has a wait on the weekend mornings but they give you a pager and it's right near a lake - so just go for a walk while you wait - and weather permitting - get patio seating. The food is excellent. I ordered the skillet with blueberry pancakes. It was delicious! Make sure to request REAL maple syrup though, as they have the fake stuff at the table. Everything was delicious, eggs, hashbrowns and veggies all fresh and cooked perfectly. A nice way to start the day and also a good place to bring friends and family from out of town.",5
2459,"American Express Centurion Lounge LAS offers a nice selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. A nice variety of buffet style foods to select from. Free Wi-Fi, updated flight arrival and departure times, comfortable seating, current news and sports updates. Current newspapers and magazines are available as well.  The restrooms are very clean. Very nice added feature for American Express card holders. Design similar to the Centurion Lounge at SEA-TAC.",5
2460,"STAY AWAY.  I made additional principal payments; they didn't credit them; they sold my loan to Wells Fargo (who are great, BTW) and had a wrong starting balance missing my principal payments.  After an enormous email chain they acknowledged it and claimed they'd fix it - but no check ever arrived.  I've called over a dozen times with no reply.  I think they're out of business, to tell you the truth.",1
2461,"There's nothing not to love...

It's rare to find a place that's so unusual in the middle of Phoenix. 

Everything is good and they have these french pancakes that I can't resist getting each time I go. That's a problem because their pizza is so good... So now I figure I'll still get the french pancakes and take a pizza home for dinner.

I just like the whole atmosphere. Very city like with tight cramped rows of grocery items and gifts along with tables scattered about to sit and enjoy the weather. 

Sandwiches, Breakfast, Pizza and don't forget the most beautiful decorated cakes I've ever seen. I have yet to try them because they appear dangerous to my thighs.",5
2462,"I highly recommend Bijin Aesthetics!  Zana is knowledgeable, compassionate, and highly skilled.  She has the ability to analyze your skin care needs and address them appropriately.  I have been going to Zana for over 12 years and will never go anywhere else!  I get so many compliments on my skin from friends and strangers!  In addition to the many different age defying facial treatments she utilizes, she has an acne program which clears even the most severe cystic acne.  I referred a friend who has seen amazing results without the use of oral medication.  Try this Aesthetician - you won't be sorry!",5
2464,"The guys who work here are great and it's a pleasure to be served by them.
Being latina and growing up in the southwest U.S. I know my Latin American food and Mexican food, very well infact because my family is Salvadoran. 

Burritos are really American, don't go to a Mexican/Salvadoran place for burritos, infact the best place for burritos is probably a place where YOU can customize your own since people are specific about how they like their burrito. Most Toronto places use a lot of fillers like rice and beans or even potato and sweet potato, so know what you like and tell them..but again I wouldn't recommend this place for hardcore burrito people.

Try to go for the Salvadoran dishes or even tacos when you're here, remember this isn't your typical American hole in the wall fast food joint, it's a bit more authentic so they don't use sour cream or tons of cheeses you might expect from a Tex-Mex place. 

Jalapenos, Guacamole and the salsas make everything 10x better. Cash only.",5
2465,"As a French person I came to Canada thinking it was an abomination of food, but I went because my friend wanted to try it and decided ""what the heck"" completely expecting disappointment, for it to be way too fatty, and flavorless, and heavy.

We had an option to dine at Gordon Ramsay's steakhouse on Friday. Indeed a delight. Sean and Oliver were exemplary",5
2469,"I am very sad to write this review as I have been a customer here for three years. Up until now I have been very happy with all of my service. As stated by other reviewer's the language barrier is an issue but never became a problem. Until now. I took a pair of coated jeans in to be fixed. The seam in the rear was undone. The jeans were in excellent condition when I dropped them off. I picked them up and left, not thinking to check the item, as I have been going there for years. The jeans are ruined. They did something to pucker the fabric all around where the repair was made. They deny any responsibility. This is where the language barrier becomes a big issue. They insist they did nothing wrong. I left frustrated and out $160 for jeans I loved.",1
2470,"Bacon, beer and moonshine... Enough said! Bacon board was incredible!! Selection of moonshines were dangerous. Several craft beers on tap, many local. Also tried the pulled pork entree- amazing! Heard the brisket is their specialty but they were out unfortunately. Mashed pitied with baked cheese crust on top was delicious! Service was very good and attentive. Fun, relaxed, laid back vibe with mellow lighting. Lots of candles and mason jar lights... Brick walls... Upscale BBQ feel. I would certainly come back! Gotta try the brisket!",5
2471,"We just checked in and this is the state of the room, ugh! It literally gives me the creeps. I will not sit on that stained couch with holes in it. I am looking at a all nighter without sleep afraid if bedbugs. I have NEVER been in such a gross room. Nick at the front desk put us in a nice room, we think! Prayers for a good sleep!

In the new room the TV in the sitting room doesn't work and my husband just killed this bug on the bed!!!

GROSS! Do NOT stay here!",1
2472,Came in here looking for a Jaguar for my mother. Israel told me to come back in 3 days and he would bring in a few cars.. Sure enough I came back and there was 4 cars to choose from. I ended up buying an S Type 2011. Very good hard working honest people. Highly recommend.,5

2476,"Per their location hours, they open at 9am. I have tried calling multiple times to try and set up and appointment and the number just keeps ringing.. Went online and booked an appt for 11am and then received a call stating that it's not going to happen and I can come in at 2pm.. When I respectfully declined letting her know that I would have to pick up my children at that time.. She became even more rude and I will never give them my business!!",1
2477,"This place is a gem!

Everytime I need a present or want to buy myself a little something different I head to this store. The owners and staff are so helpful and give such great advice.
I also visit this store every year before Christmas and get all my 'tricky' gifts there. You don't know what to get for someone - this store will have something for anyone!

I love the Matt&Nat selection as well as the variety of items.

The dogs are sweet and make this place feel even more welcoming.",5
2478,Went to get my first tattoo here. Johnny Vegas did a great job! I highly recommend him if anyone is the area. Definitely planning on going back for my next tattoos!,5
2479,Not to far from my house and I love their carne Asada fries. Everything is always fresh and the stuff are friendly. They have a drive thru which is great when I in a rush and hungry. Only downfall is that when I try to call and place an order for pick up no one speaks English and she hung up on me.,5
2481,"Never go near this place under any circumstance. Not only the noisy neighbors stomping upstairs but also the big leak in the closet which is pouring out water for the last day. 

Another bad incident happened later on when I moved out of the apt and they put me in collections even though I paid more than I owed. The manager tried to leave me with bad credit and no explanation. What a nightmare you will be dealing with if you move in here.",1
2482,"Wow.  This place absolutely floored me.  It was October 2nd and and a group of 13 of us showed up by limosuine to celebrate my wife's 30th birthday.  I had spoken to a gentleman on the phone a few days before to reserve a table and he happily saved one for us--without even requiring bottle service!  When we arrived we were given corner seating with an innocent but inviting metal pole nearby.  

Drinks were stiff and our server was patient and efficient.  It was relatively slow when we arrived and the DJ was thoughtful enough to base his volume level on the club population/vibe.  The music was superb for duration of our stay.  There is an outdoor fenced-off area for the smokers.  The bathrooms are co-ed and well-appointed.  

We were on a strict schedule and had to leave to Devil's Martini for bottle service after only an hour and a half but most of us wished we could've stay longer.  I cannot wait to return!",5
2483,"I'm not a big fan of breakfast places or breakfast at all. Ben & Florentine is decent, but still doesn't make me want to eat there or have breakfast, plus it's expensive. But this place is a different story.

I've come here twice now and I plan on coming many more times. Both times I've been greeted by the same very friendly waitress, who has been very attentive and speedy. The place is well lit, clean and feels inviting.

Onto the food! I've ordered the same thing twice because the first time was amazing and I needed to know if the food was consistent. It was. The bacon is some of the best cooked bacon I've ever had, the eggs were perfect and the home fries were also perfect. I will update this review if that changes, but for now 5/5.",5
2486,This is the worst in Vegas to spend your time.  Even at the discount we got on tickets it was way over priced.  First of all they had a drink minimum that I was not aware of when i purchased the tickets.  The drinks we were forced to buy were awful and the comedy was not very funny.  The burlesque dancers were not that great looking and not that great at dancing.  You would think they could find much prettier and talented dancers in Vegas.  Do not waste your time or money here.  Go to the pinball museum instead.,1
2489,Great place! and Bartender Kristina (i think) is awesome.,5
2491,"A fun event.   It was planned with friends.  Hoppy Moto was an excellent guide and driver.

You can customize your brewery tiur.  If you don't know they will plan it all.

Our tour started at North Mountain Brewery.  This place was excellent!   A great tour from the owner.   Next stop was lunch at Mother Bunch brewery.   Great food.  Our last stop was Phoenix Ale Brewery.   Phoenix Ale was a bit small and I would probably select a different 3rd stop.

Overall our tour was extremely fun and I would highly recommend.",5
2492,"Great hair salon and spa, spacious bright and clean, and very welcoming and attentive staff..my stylist was Gladys, she's very friendly and clever, took the time to give me advice on the hair style that best suits me and the colour and I was very happy with the results. I also had a pedicure and the lady that did it was Nathalie who gives the best foot massages ever...it was a great experience, I'll definitely be back!",5
2493,"I always make sure to stop by this place anytime I'm in the area for some shopping at St. Lawrence market. Each time I've been here, I've had a consistently great experience. Friendly and wonderful employees, cocoa root beer that is to die for (free refills), and my favorite - the pork belly BLT hot dog. The sausage is unique- very juicy and tender, and the arugula/house mayonnaise are the perfect accompaniment. I also love the bread that the sausage is served on. 

I got a voucher for free fries while I was eating here once- what a pleasant surprise!",5
2495,"We sat at the bar and Tommy, the barman, was a friendly guy took really good care of us. Had the classic pizza, delicious.  They have a good selection of wines and beers. No complaints at all!",5
2496,"The green chile huevos rancheros is the best breakfast dish I've had in ages. Perfectly cooked and seasoned pork in a yummy sauce. The seasoned fried potatoes were also cooked perfectly and were not greasy at all. When the food is combined with a very attentive waitress, it equals a win!",5
2498,"I came here with the family for the first time. I am giving  it a five star because the service, food and atmosphere are great. Our server was Stacy and she did a phenomenal job, for that reason alone we will definitely come back. Stacy, offer us a special that we did not even know about and ended it up saving some money. Than you!!!",5
2500,"When I first was booking my Megabus ticket from Pittsburgh to NYC I was very skeptical about taking the Megabus because of the reviews, especially because I was going to take an overnight bus. Don't worry!  The bus was great! The bus drivers were nice, yes they were bold but also hilarious! I slept like a baby, but would wake up at the rest stops. If you are traveling alone and are freaking out a bit, there are tons of people on the bus and you automatically feel safe. 

Hop on and enjoy this affordable bus ride!",5
2501,Pharmacists are very nice and professional! Never a huge wait at drive thru. Plenty of parking and always received my prescriptions from doctors with no trouble!,5
2502,"I am really happy with the staff over at Findlay Fiat.  I have referred several friends and family to the store to purchase vehicles.  They call their showroom a ""studio"" and it's decorated like a cool, swanky design center.  They give customers a warm welcome when they enter and ensure the customers are comfortable with their purchase.  They always have a good amount of preowned options (Not just Fiat).  Give them a try for your purchase.  The dealership is smaller than most so it has more of a family feel.",5
2503,"My husband, daughter and I went to this restaurant today for lunch. It was 2:30 pm and there were approximately 20 people already in the restaurant eating.  When we were waiting to be seated one of the staff members came to tell us they were closing. It's 2:30 in the afternoon why would they be closing early on a Saturday? Also, their website states they close at 11 pm so that was really weird. I had to look down to see the color of my skin to figure out why they were all of a sudden closing so early. But that's okay, I would much rather give my hard earned money to a company that respect and values their customers regardless of  what race they are. I drove about a mile up the street to another restaurant called India Oven Masala. I had no issues there. Their food was great and their service was awesome as well. So I will definitely recommend going to that restaurant instead.",1

2512,"Please don't go here if you want a sanitary place or if you like good looking nails. My family visited yesterday before photos with our ailing grandfather and wanted to get spruced up. We had mani pedis and after my pedicure my nail tech used a cuticle pusher with a quarter inch of skin cells already on it for my manicure I couldn't believe it! My sister watched him go from the lady next to her to herself without changing gloves for her pedicure! She massively screwed up the design on my thumbs and even told me she was sorry but she didn't have time to fix them. SHE ACKNOWLEDGED SHE MESSED UP MY MANICURE BUT DIDN'T OFFER TO FIX IT IN ANY WAY! They still wanted me to pay the extra $10 for the design"" on my thumbs after I politely asked them to fix it but they refused! Please look at the pics I'm attaching and don't go here; nothings worth possibly getting an infection or definitely getting a terrible manicure and pedicure.",1
2515,"Giving them one more chance, never really enjoyed the food before, usually too bland for my taste.  But we sat for 10 minutes when it was relatively slow as it was 4:30. At least 3 servers walked by our table more than once. People seated after us were greeted within the typical minute and still we sat.  There are many flaws I can tolerate but just stopping in after a customer is seated should be such a simple step.  Sadly it seems to be hard at this location.",1

2521,"Run by the Black Hoof next door this is a must visit after dinner.  Really cool visually, it takes you away to a different place and time.  The drinks are amazing, try them all. The food takes it to another level with dishes you wouldn't expect in Canada. The fritters are out of this world, and paired with the slaw were perfect.  Cashew chicken was the caribbean on a plate. Come here to eat or drink.",5

2529,"Easy hike, beautiful vistas, pretty rocks, small stream. That's the review in a nutshell. 

This is a good intro hike for the Red Rock Canyon area. It's a 3+ mile out-and-back that runs from the roadside across the valley floor to the mouth of a canyon. The trail is wide and easy, with a slight incline all the way out. As you get closer to the canyon, it starts to get narrower and branch off into a bunch of different directions. If your goal is to make it to the mouth of the canyon, it doesn't really matter which one you take, they all converge back at the canyon. If you want to find the waterfall, you supposedly turn right at the first tree. We didn't seek it out, but instead headed for the canyon mouth. It gets a little more scramble-y as you get close to the canyon mouth, but the views keep getting better and better.  

Along the way you're exposed to sweeping views across the canyon floor, with the red rocks to the north, commanding cliffs to the west, the road and gypsum mines back to the east, and valley/mountains to the south. On a nice day, you can see for miles and miles. 

Our group included folks from 40-78 years in age, and everyone did just fine. Trail is a mix of sand/dirt and rocks. Because it's an out-and-back, whenever the scramble gets to be too much, just turn around. 

Rock climbing up in the canyon is a thing. You can fly drones here, and the topology is worth it. We didn't see any wild horses or burros (dammit!) but did see a woodpecker. Cold winter though, so I'm sure all the animals were camped out somewhere else. 

5/5 would hike again!",5
2531,"Amazing soup, ribs and the Hatch Chili Burger is awesome. Get the steak and onion soup. I travel from the east valley to get this soup.",5
2532,Price is average. Clean & nice/cute environment. Really good customer svs. Rain was very helpful & pleasant. I ordered a oolong milk tea with mini bobas & it tasted amazing. I will definitely be going back.,5
2533,"On 12/23, I dined here with family and I will not return. I chose this restaurant because of the reviews on yelp. However, the hibachi dinners were served cold, the teriyaki salmon was not fresh, and the food did not come out together.

The manager, Mimi, came to address the table and we explained the salmon dinner was not good and the food was not hot. Mimi informed us that what is ""good"" varies from person to person, and she could not comp the salmon dinner, but offer 20% off. I've never heard of a manager not comping a meal that was unsatisfactory. 

I've never heard of a manager leaving their party upset, especially on a first-time dining experience.

Save your money and dine elsewhere.",1
2535,"This place is way overpriced for the old ""falling apart"" smelly, pests infested, dirty breeze ways, birds poops on sideways, high crime (frequent robberies, stolen, vandalized cars) living. The only reason for one star is that the previous management seemed to be in my experience more accommodating than the new current management.",1
2536,"The food here was really great! I came here with five other people and we shared everything so it was a great way to taste most of the items on the menu.

I started with the L'ange de L'assassinat for cocktails. It's 2.5 ounces, and at $15, it didn't blow my mind. It honestly tasted like lime juice with some sparkling water and a little bit of alcohol, so I was a little disappointed.

To begin, we had the cheese platter and the toast with a quail's egg, blood sausage and shrimp on top. The latter was really divine. We also got the sweetbreads with tuna (a definite favourite!). The razor clams were great, but a little too lemony and sour for my liking. The patatas bravas were amaaazing! The bone marrow paled in comparison to everything else and the chimichurri sauce was too overpowering and didn't let the bone marrow shine through. Our final dish was half an octopus over potatoes and rapini/dandelion (?) greens. This dish was also amazing. The octopus was cooked just right and the potatoes were so good! But the greens were way too bitter.

To end, we had the basque cake - divine! 

Highly recommend this place. You have to make an order of bread separately, and I made the mistake of eating too much bread!",5
2538,"My friend and I stopped here for dinner. Very nice inside, comfortable seating. Multiple vegan pizza options.",5
2540,"I really don't have enough nice things to say about this place!
This cash-only bar is clean and well-maintained. There is a pool table and one or two electronic games inside the establishment and at least a dozen huge flat screen TVs to watch your teams play. They have a loaded jukebox and on Fridays they host karaoke. Out back is a patio where you can watch the game and play corn hole. 
They serve beer by the bottle and can ($2.50) and wine ($5 a glass) only, no liquor. This gives the place a kind of throw back feel. It's relaxed and none of the patrons get out of hand on Jager shots.
I can't review the food because I don't eat burgers and hot dogs (beef and pork), but everyone who was eating seemed to really enjoy it. Apparently the chili recipe is literally a family secret that has been passed down through the generations.
We recently threw a surprise 70th birthday party for my father, an O'Neil's regular, at the bar. The management was super accommodating and everything went off without a hitch! They let us bring our own food, gave us a discount on our open bar and made every effort to make the party a success.
I wouldn't recommend this place to someone looking for a fancy night out, but if you like cinder-block saloons where the bartender will learn your name, this is the place for you!",5
2545,"Took 45 minutes to check in after arriving for my 3:40pm appt.  it is now 5:00pm and I'm waiting in room for Doctor.   Bush league staff and slow service.  Fits right in with the Medical Profession.  5:15 pm - No Doctor sightings I'm leaving.  DO NOT BELIEVE THE OTHER WEBSITE REVIEWS ON THIS PLACE.......STAY AWAY!!!!  Upon my exit I have an exchange with the Doctor (whose voice was chatting outside my door for 30 minutes).  I inform them I've been waiting an hour and half and I'm leaving before asking for directions to the exit.  She informs me she has been there since 8:00am (as though that justifies making a patient wait unnecessarily) and she was just getting ready to come into my room.  To my knowledge I was and had been for some time the only customer in the facility.  It would have taken her 10 steps and 2 minutes to get me on my way.  No respect for patients time, displayed abhorrent customer service and generally despicable human behavior.  With the bar as low as it is in the medical field, this place manages to set lower standards.",1
2546,Awesome school! Great instruction! Welcomed in for a drop in class.  Students and coaches truly devoted to elevating their sport without ego. Would recommend for anybody visiting the area.,5
2547,Got home found water softner leaking. Called a few places and looked online. Saw the yelp reviews and decided to give a try since there's only good things about this place. Also. They had the $40 voucher .. What a deal since majority of all the places I called had around that a high cost to come by and check it out. Although Jeremy was backed up in prior appts the secretary updated me on what time he was able to come! I reAlly thought that was awesome! Great customer service! Jeremy was very helpful and explained what happened to my water softner. Very polite and friendly. Definitely will keep their # in hand for future reference/recommendations! Good prices!,5

Stay away from these money hungry, taking advantage of students who are eligible for grants and loans, racist fake people.  The instructors are okay, but they need to run like hell and seek new jobs before they lose their license to teach.  The instructors can only do what they are taught by administrators.  The administration sucks!!!! The walk you through the paper process as though the students were dummies.  That stupid laughing hyena counselor or whatever title she is referred too, has absolutely no skills to help the student academically. The rest of the crew that sits in that one room office is ridiculous.  They discuss student personal information among themselves. They make other insinuations..., the list goes on and on with these people.  If you decide to withdraw, look out.  They will have every official in this school calling trying to lure you back in to this over $3000.00 ++ five week quarterly course.  If they call or email me one more time, I will contact the local police department for harassment.  Please be careful when enrolling into this cult!!!!!

The shakes here were kind of icy and I really could have done without them. But I thought since the name contained the word ""shake"" it would be something worth remembering. The burger was wimpy and the fries were too. Wouldn't come back.",1
2553,"We've stayed here several times and enjoy the spacious rooms.  However, our last stay, and I mean our LAST stay was a disaster.

My wife tried to book a room but could not get a confirmation on her computer.  I tried and booked a room.  When we checked in the lady said we had booked 2 rooms; I explained and she just said okay.  We got a bill for 2 rooms; I called to dispute and was told that we didn't cancel prior to the 24 hrs required.  I explained what had happened and got zero help, just the 'That's our policy' crap.

Also, the room we did stay in had a very bad odor.  We had housekeeping come in; they sprayed something around the room and left.  The smell returned; we opened the windows the 2"" they allow and let the air on.  The smell remained (and probably still does).

Too many other hotel options to put up with these idiots.",1
2554,Fabulous menu great friendly service and amazing food !!!! Wish they had one of these in Tucson. Thankfully we make it here a few times a year :-) thanks for another amazing meal love the additions. Had the spinach wraps with slaw and hubby had the steak wraps.

2560,"Sorry, this is very unfortunate.  Was really looking forward to trying this place (KUPD fan).  Take out order for a small group for the NFL Football Championship games.  Expected it to be busy but business was extremely slow. And this is why: First off everything was extremely salty.  Smoked wings= very over cooked, actually so over cooked they were hard as a rock.  Same with the brisket, over cooked, tough, and burnt.  Opposite for the fried pickles, soggy like mush.  Most of the food was thrown away before the end of the first quarter!  Would not recommend this place.",1
2561,I love this little boutique !  The owner searches for the latest styles and there something for everyone young and older!  I just bought the cutest dress with a cut out in the back! I can't wait to wear it!  The shop also carries some really nice jewelry and purses ! And she also carries some candles that smell fabulous! It a great place to find something unique!,5
2562,"I live in a part of Toronto that is completely inundated with balcony happy pigeons.  They love to sit on your railing and poop their little hearts out.  My balcony was covered in about 2 years worth of poop, dust bunnies, cigarette ashes, and spilled drinks...  all baked in by hot summer sun.  

Derrick from Multi-Services came in and basically made my balcony look brand new over the course of 1 hour.  NEW.  I could not believe it.   
All stains and debris were totally removed and sanitized from the balcony floor, windows and sliding screen door.  Nothing was spilled out onto units below me.  
I was very very impressed.  Not only was Derrick professional, on time, and respectful of the unit, he was also a super nice guy.  

Tip for pigeon problems-
Buy a slinky, mount it across the top of your railing to stop the pigeons from hanging out and doing their biz on your balcony.  
Since my cleaning, I've keep the balcony clutter free and the pigeons seem to not be interested in visiting me.  It's been 3 weeks and no poop.",5
2563,"Tucked in the corner INSIDE of the IGA grocery store, this is a hidden gem of a coffee shop. It's not what you'd expect in a grocery store. Because it's in the corner, the setting is quiet and cozy without the noise of even a typical shop. Coffee options are great and the prices are cheaper than anything you'd find in the C-U area. Deb has a wonderful personality and gets her roasts fresh from Columbia Street right in town. Definitely check it out (and grab a few chocolates or pastries to top it off!)!",5
2564,"I admit I was a skeptic...a plethora of vegan options at a Las Vegas buffet?  Get out of here, that's a lie!  But it's true, I couldn't believe my eyes.  Before we paid to get into the buffet I inquired about these so-called vegan options thinking that there may only be one or two things for me.  To my surprise they gave me the option to have a chef personally walk me around and tell me what's vegan-friendly and what can be made vegan upon request.  The chef was great, personable, and very knowledgeable about the plant-based diet.  He walked me through every dish and nearly every ingredient, I felt like I was getting star-treatment.  At the end of my little tour I realized I could have at least half of the offerings on the buffet...and that, my friends, is exactly what I did.  I never get to eat at buffets, I exercise, and eat healthy at home, so why not?!?!  I enjoyed many things such as Alfredo pasta (custom-made at the pasta station), many different kinds of salads (quinoa salad, chickpea salad, etc.), many kinds of veggies, vegan tomato soup, sushi, ethnic dishes (aloo gobi, channa masala, etc.), candied apples, and the best vegan chocolate chip cookie baked on this planet.  Mind you, there were many vegan things I just couldn't get to...I filled up sooner than I would have liked.  Overall, this was a great experience, the Wynn is simply impressive.  I highly recommend the buffet to vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores alike.",5
2565,My favorite Mexican food! I always order  a machaca potato and extra cheese burro. The cheese quesadillas and tortillas are delicious too. I like to wash it down with some of their horchata. I am not a fan of eating at the restaurant as it's a little ghetto but it is very clean. I recommend calling in the order since it gets really busy sometimes.,5
2566,"I attended the breakfast buffet at 7:30AM with a few office teammates and was blown away by the experience. 

The restaurant itself matches the style of the Fairmont Palliser in opulence and open design, lending itself well to having a conversation, and the staff were very friendly and attentive - especially noteworthy given the hour we were dining!

The buffet selection was diverse and included such staples as eggs benedict, waffles, and omelettes, in addition to a great selection of pastries and fruit. 

Overall the experience was memorable and I wouldn't hesitate to visit again or recommend it to friends.",5
2567,"my pup got really sick in the middle of the night on a weekend and was puking all over. i was so happy to see i had a 24 hour clinic right around the corner (thanks yelp!) and even happier to find out they had the same prices all around the clock, business hours or not. they were super friendly and honest about what my options were but what they actually thought was appropriate, and even called to check on her the next couple of days.",5
2568,on a slow day..take so damn long for your food!!..super disappointed!!..slakin big tym!,1
2569,"We had a great sales experience ordering and receiving our awesome Clubman. Paul Ebeyer handled the sale with professionalism and knowledge. The car was a special order and was actually delivered a full month early. The dealership is comfortable and low key. The car came in exactly as we ordered it and was delivered to us sparkling. All the electronics and bells and whistles on the car were patiently explained.  All around the best word I can use to summarize our experience is PERFECT. Also, the Clubman is a fantastic car....soooooo much fun!",5

2575,"Who had a great time we had tonight, brought my brother in for his birthday and there is a large group of us. Deborah Weber was our waitress and she was awesome handle the whole group so well. We love the food it was great, like I say wonderful service, wonderful night we got to set out on the patio and just really enjoyed everything. Will come back a lot!",5
2577,We walked inside the restaurant very excited to eat at this famous restaurant for dinner and when we entered inside this seemingly authentic Indian restaurant we found it almost empty with none of the hotel staff anywhere in sight and just a couple of diners sitting in one table. we decided to wait for a couple of minutes to see if anyone from the staff would appear. But no one showed up. After waiting for 5 minutes we decided to leave. It was extremely disappointing that a restaurant with such good reputation would give us such a terrible experience!!!,1
2579,"My experience at Cycle Gear was extremely positive. The manager, Keith, was fantastic and helped me, a novice cyclist and first time helmet buyer, both feel good about what I wanted to buy with confidence and did a great job explaining things. Keith's customer service was fantastic. He took the time to explain the options for me, the pros and cons of different types of helmets, and was very knowledgeable.  I would definitely come back to Cycle Gear based on the products but more importantly, the customer service by Keith. If his bosses read this review, they should be very happy with his work.",5
2580,"Extremely disappointing. I always heard how great the cupcakes at The Cupcakery were, so I finally tried it. I got 2 red velvet cupcakes, one for me and one for my friend's birthday. The icing was alright but the CAKE WAS EXTREMELY DRY AND STALE. My friend did not enjoy hers at all either. I feel like our cupcakes were a week old. Save your money and go to Retro Bakery instead!",1
2581,Great little place has a sport bar feel quite comfortable. Stopped in an had original wings my wife had a chicken wrap and they were excellent fresh tasty we had there spicy buffalo chips with ranch . Service was excellent  highly recommend this place for a quick bite. Also easy on the wallet.,5
2583,"STAY AWAY! The cleanest part of this place was their bathrooms. Flies on the food, which was cold by the way, sticky floors, ripped seats, hideous walls, rude servers and even the food was bad. I understand they can muck up american food because their not used to cooking it, but even their food was god awful. $10 is way over priced for what you can get. Half the buffet was dessert and salad. I would say $5.99 would be more accurate to the service you get. This is the golden corral of foreign food. Will never go back and I wish I could stand outside the building and stop people from going in.",1
2585,"I absolutely love this place. I've been going for several months now and it's safe to say it is now my permanent salon. The staff is always kind and professional. They take their time and make sure it is to your standards. I have never been cut by them before which was an issue with other salons and no fungus as well. 

My nails always look perfect and I receive so many compliments. Highly recommend",5
2587,This place is adorable. The food and service were excellent. The daily specials are fantastic. We will definitely go back!,5
2589,"Friendliest breakfast in town. Best for hungover tea and a good book. The patio is beautiful as are the lovely waitresses

It's not fancy but it's family",5
2590,"Great experience!  Good quality for AYCE sushi, with a nice selection of traditional sushi, not-so-traditional rolls and cooked dishes.  The severs are kind and it's a lovely room, in contrast to other AYCE joints.  Looking forward to many returns.",5
2591,"I got the chicken parm sandwich and it was delicious. With a side of coleslaw and potato chips, I left the restaurant with a smile.",5
2592,"Absolutely excellent customer service! Have been coming to Polar Snow since they were located off Craig/Simmons. Their current location is a great location with definitely enough parking. The wait is never too bad. Definitely expect a wait time of 5 minutes or so on days were the weather outside is warmer. They definitely make up for those longer wait times though with giving out BOGO free cards to their customers. (This place is definitely worth the wait though regardless of the BOGO free card) There is so many options to choose from that you really can't go wrong with whatever you choose. My 3yr old son absolutely loves coming here & always wants to get a mango, bing cherry & peach. ""The Bob Marley"" & ""The Bigstick"" are some great tasting options as well. Will definitely be visiting pretty often with summer approaching.",5
2593,Great wine and friendly service. They certainly know a lot about their wine.  I would highly suggest the Cuyahoga Valley red wine!,5
2594,These girls are the best. They do a great job for reasonable price. They care about your dog and will know your dog by its first name after you go a few times. Best in town.,5
2595,"Love, love, love this Walgreens!  They always recognize me, greet everyone that comes into the store, and are helpful.  The make-up/cosmetics team is great, and they always know what discount coupons are available for their customers.  They're all helpful and seem to enjoy their jobs.",5
2597,I have been coming to this spa for a few month's since I moved to the area and each time has been a great experience.  Lisa is amazing with facial treatments and I always want to book another Appointment before I leave.  LOVE THIS  PLACE!!!,5
2598,"Great place for lunch,  if you are looking for a quiet place to lunch this is a good place.
Oliver is terrific make you feel very welcome.",5
2599,"Worst customer service. Came in to get a ""gender reveal"" pi√±ata and spoke to someone on the phone who said we could drop off the results and they would prepare everything for us. We got there after our appointment with our results and the employees said they couldn't do it. It would have to be a balloon and not a pi√±ata.. what is the difference? It would have been even less work to just throw the stuff that we purchased into the pi√±ata but whatever. We ended up asking a stranger in the store who was kind enough to set it up for us and the employees were annoyed that we even did that but oh well. I think they were just being lazy and didn't feel like providing good customer service.",1
2600,This place was amazing! My first time here and I was blown away!! Would definitely recommend,5
2601,"I enjoy their sushi, one of the best place to go ACE. just like Sushimon but better. I tried other sushi's in las vegas but I'm always drawn back to Goyemon and Sushimon...this is good and reasonable place...more fish less rice...",5
2603,"If you are a fan of hot food, this is the place you should go! 

We had Thai hot- drunken noodles, it was really good and to take hotnesss to next level they provided us with their freshly made chilly paste, which was like cherry on the top :) 

I highly recommend it!!!",5
2604,"Doc's artisan ice cream is so good! My whole family loves this place! It comes with a lot of ice cream.  I hope you will like this place to.  Doc is very nice and you can talk to him easily. My favorite flavors are Chai and Anti Chili. There is plenty of parking. 

This review was done by my 8 year old daughter.",5
2605,3 years later.... Still the slowest Starbucks and car in front if me... Their order was clearly wrong bc they kept pausing and talking then pulled in to go inside LOL it's not rocket science people!!! I've been waiting 12 mins for a grande iced latte. Thank goodness for air conditioning,1
2606,"I have a 2003 Hyundai Elantra - granted it's a beater. Took it in to the garage to get it inspected and they wanted more than $2K for it to pass. No way. I was ready to sell it.

Then I found out about Garage2u. Garage2u is a mobile mechanic. They come to your house  (or wherever your car is) and fix it right there. They have all the tools that they need. In my case he worked on my car in the driveway. It couldn't have been easier. And it couldn't have been more cost effective. Way less than half of what the garage wanted. And it passed inspection! 

Oh and get this. Dan (the mechanic) called me two days later to follow up and make sure that everything was ok with the car. Show me another mechanic that does that!

So I get to keep the car a few more years. Many thanks to Dan and Garage2u.",5
2607,"I personally did not do a float but I accompanied two others that did. 

They loved the experience, but I can't judge on the float itself, just the atmosphere. 

The spa itself is very clean and clear and welcoming. It has a nice fishtank, nice minimalist furnishings, is very ""zen"" and looks nice. They have a great oxygen bar/lounge room, a room for introducing their video and what float spas are, etc. The float rooms are very professional- towel/clothes racks, showers, tiles, safety pool ""rugs,"" etc. They even have a little vanity room to freshen up after you do your float. 

Steven helped us for the most part and he was extremely helpful and very nice. He is a great person to be helped by and work there. They charge for their chi machine (little massager/spine-moving thing in their community den where they do meditations, events, movies, etc) but he allowed me to use it and take advantage of the den while I was waiting for the two floaters I was with. 

They even gave us little epsom salt gift bags, event calendar and more info.


Overall, great place. 

Steven was EXCELLENT and made me feel like I should try floating next time, but didn't force it down my throat, ya know? I have anxiety and claustrophobia which is why I didn't try it with the others I was with, but he let me know different options for people like me. :)

Will definitely go back, recommend and hopefully try myself one day!",5
2608,"This place is a rarity in the used car buying arena.  My wife and I were looking for a Prius plug in, and what we happened upon through private party was extraordinarily expensive.  Through Craigslist we found Millenium Auto Network.  They are a blip of the map driving down main st. In Mesa.  They specialize in reliable Hondas and Toyotas and have a unique specialization in the Prius.  My impression from the entire experience :  They are honest , upfront and trustworthy.  We got an immediate sense of pressure free relaxation through the whole experience.  Almost like going to your favorite coffee shop or restaurant, were the owners know you personally.  No pressure whatsoever.  They put the prices so low and their financing is so good it's hard not to buy a car or truck from them.   They even replaced a couple parts that were dented and cracked under the Prius we found the next morning free of charge.  I am a great judge of people and these people are exceptional and should be the standard in the car buying business.  The owner Brad and sales manager Randy are good honest family people and I whole heartedly give them 5 stars .",5
2610,"I loved my stay at this casino, it was very kid friendly with the adventuredome and we loved the new water slide and water park area. The rooms were clean and we had no complaints there. I wish the buffet would be up to par with the hotel. But we did enjoy our stay there.",5
2611,Very professional and competitively priced.  There was hardly any wait at all.  Door works better than ever.  Thanks guys!  Absolute recommend.,5
2612,"Alfredo's Jewelry is an awesome Ma & Pa place and they have great jewelry for great prices.  They can also make just about anything!  My friend got me connected with this family owned business.  Her jewelry looks amazing!
Every time I have gone into Alfredo's they clean my jewelry :) nice bonus - no charge if you are a customer there (or even before I even became a customer).  
Great customer service and the staff there does not get commission, so you know you get honest folks who seem like they like their job :) 

I have gotten a Jewelry appraisals - very throughout and great price.  
If you don't have a family jeweler, this is the place to go!  You won't be disappointed!",5
2613,"Awesome prices for the amount of food!!! Very authentic! Nothing Tex mex going on here!!! Servers were very polite, music was good, tables were clean! I would recommend it to anyone and the menus were in English as well!",5
2617,"Bistro la Bon is nothing short of amazing.  We finally tried them during Charlotte Restaurant Week, and my first thought upon leaving was, ""What took us so long to try this place?!""  

We had their kale and beet salads to start.  Both were very good.  Next, each of us had the octopus.  That dish was absolutely outstanding.  It was both spicy and slightly sweet--served with ratatouille and a creamy sauce (sour cream based?)--and was unbelievably tender.  I'd return to BLB just for THAT dish.  

For our entrees, I had the scallops, and my husband had the filet, each a $6 upcharge.  Mine had four scallops, served with tiny croutons, hazelnuts, sliced fingerling potatoes, and a delicious sauce that tasted mushroom-based.  They were cooked perfectly, and just fantastic.  My husband's filet was also cooked to perfection, served with mashed potatoes and a little gravy.  

For dessert I had the brioche bread pudding with vanilla ice cream, and my husband had the maple ice cream.  This was the finest bread pudding I've ever had - so light and delicious, sitting on top of caramel sauce.  As big as the serving was, I cleaned my plate (sharing just a few bites with my hubby). 

Definitely try their cocktails.  My husband had the Mule, made with their homemade ginger syrup, and I had the Hemingway.  Both were amazing.

Our server, Crystal, was friendly and helpful.  As busy as they were, our dishes were delivered with perfect efficiency.  They were well-prepared for the crowd, and handled it flawlessly.

I haven't been this excited about a meal in a long time.  This is a MUST visit for locals and travelers alike.  We can't wait to return!",5
2618,"The staff is friendly and helpful. I initially worried about my older dog since she is blind, but they take very good care of her and she is all smiles and wags when I pick her up.  She jumps around happy and acts like a little puppy again!",5
2622,"Walking into Marconi's was like entering a little pocket of Miami stuck in Charlotte. Spanish tunes on the radio, Latin barbers working nonstop and a great mix of clients; Black, White, Hispanic all looking for tight fades and killer shaves.

If you're a walk-in on a busy day (like I was on Saturday) then be prepared to wait.  This place has a constant influx of regulars & appointments keeping the barber ridiculously busy with only 4 chairs in the joint. Also, in God they trust... all others pay cash. Plastic is not welcomed here.

They take their time and leave no detail overlooked. Totally worth the wait for a cut that's top notch. I wish there were more barbers like this around. Sadly, they're a rare breed in this day and age of half-assed mall store haircuts.

They got the 5th star for playing Ruben Blades ""Pedro Navaja"" which is aces in my book.",5
2624,"Been wanting a decent cheese steak, and decided to give Joe's a try. Having spent most of my life in the Philadelphia - South Jersey area, I know what a good cheese steak should taste like. When I phoned in my order, the employee immediately asked if I could hold, and proceeded to drop the phone down on the counter, and for two minutes I had the pleasure of hearing every  thing that went on in the store. The flavor of the meat was very bland, and the provolone cheese ordered could barely be tasted. The sauteed onions had bits of onion skin in them, that was totally inedible!  The best thing that could be said about the sandwich was the roll was fresh! The french fries were very soggy, and under-cooked! Never again!",1
2625,"I would highly recommend Paradise Appliances if you're looking for a brand new appliance for a great price. We were able to purchase a brand new dishwasher for the same price as one on Craig's List and it was so much more convenient. We had a very pleasant experience. The shopping process was quick and easy. We were able to pick up our dishwasher and take it home, so I can't speak to delivery or installation, but we were extremely happy with our experience and will be back the next time we find a need for appliances!",5
2628,"The place is big & has a great ambiance. I had their Porter & The Husband had their IPA & Citrus beers. All were very tasty. For food we had the cornbread & at first I was a little nervous because of the texture of it. I must say I was pleasantly surprise. It was delicious. The banana leaf pork tacos did not disappoint & I'm not a big fan of quinoa but tried my husband steak tacos & they were also great but would definitely get the pork ones again & now I want to try the other ones. I would say the charro bean were my least favorite just needed more in them. Maybe onions, tequila, & some spicy flavor but I'm use to the ones I grew up with that my friends nana makes so you be the judge....Overall this place ROCKS & I'm definitely going back & recommending it to others as their new go to Brewery!",5

2634,"A Must Do while visiting Toronto.. Oh how I miss the Burger Shack. My last stint in Toronto I ate there every day of the week for 2 months. Its that good, and I was back last week, and nothing has changed. Perfection on a bun!

What can you do with a burger you say, well you can do this. Grilled burgers in their own juices on a well seasoned flat top, and an extensive condiment bar to custom build your juicy burger with, and thee best milkshakes in the known universe. I've tried to replicate their pineapple shakes many times with no luck. Check it out, it looks like a little hole in the wall and it is, but its one of the best burger joints in the world.",5
2635,"First time going yesterday since my son and his band performed for the Desert Edge Art show that was being held there. It was very nice of them to allow this at their place of business.

Check them out, you won't be disappointed. :)",5
2636,"I can't hardly believe it! I contacted this company because I was having one leak after another and my gardener was making it worse and kept charging me repeatedly to fix it. Well I looked on yelp and called this company. They came out the next day and fixed the problem quickly. AJ was a very polite young man and didn't try to sell me anything. He just worked hard and it was done.  Another company couldn't get out until the next week. Finally, I got more than what I paid for. I'm delighted!",5

2641,"Terrible service - the service was so incredibly bad that our food never arrived.

My friends and I visited on a Friday night, looking to try the place after the much instagram hype we had seen. We were skeptical because of mixed reviews but thought, we'd give it a try. The place was half full and we thought we were in luck for a Friday night.

After placing our orders for 3 waffles, we passed the time chatting. It wasn't until we stopped chatting and noticed that 45 min had passed since we ordered. We asked for a status on our orders.

The waiter advised that they would be coming in 10 min which we replied that the table next to us had finished eating (they had arrived only a few minutes before us). 

Hilariously enough, the waitress, who had originally taken order, dropped off an order slip at our table. The slip read 9.43 pm and we realized that they had literally just put the order in. They had forgot our order. Instead of apologizing, they pretended as if it was on its way.

We got up to leave and the waitress had the nerve to ask, ""You don't want your orders?"" 

So, no review on food be can provided. However, based on the terrible service, I doubt the food quality and believe the poor reviews of their food.",1
2643,"I have been searching everywhere to get my hair and make up done for my wedding and I came across their site and decided to do a makeup and hair trial. Scheduling through the site was super easy! My artist came to my home (talk about convenience!). She was professional and friendly! She made me feel like I have known her forever! She was open to hear my ideas, but also provided great suggestions that I wouldn't have thought of myself! I can't wait to have her recreate the look on my special day!! Highly recommend!",5

2645,"I was a big fan of BT's Burger Joint after they opened.  My last experience will make it very difficult to return.  
The manager had part of the dining area closed for floor cleaning. Employee's were taking money, moving mop buckets around the area and then delivering food.  All this with out washing their hands.  Manager was also guilty of not washing hands between operations and food handling.
Employee working the grill, sneezed into his hands then touched cooking utensils without washing hands.
This is really a shame the management was not setting the example of food safety.  
Visit at your own risk.",1

2648,"the chicken parm came out piping hot and tasty. tons of good food. this is my first visit here and the garlic knots are good. i will definitely be back for lunch and dinner. i have to admit though, tony really makes the joint. there's something nice about a smile and a handshake and a really welcoming personality. great guy.",5
2650,"The worst customer service I have ever experienced.  Trailers and trucks all over the place, so I had to make a place to park.  Ended up getting cursed out by a maintenance guy.   Nice job U-haul!!!!  Will never be going back to this place again.",1
2651,"Not Just Coffee has, hands down the best cappuccino in town. And unless you tell them you're taking it to go they serve it in a proper cup with a saucer and spoon rather than a cardboard cup and plastic lid...because this isn't a freakin' McDonalds! But whether you take it to go or not, they always do a little latte art with your foam. Presentation matters. I wish more coffee places would learn that.

If coffee's not your thing, the Italian sodas are also the best around. They make them with homemade syrups that feature not the typical sugary fruit flavors, but subtle blends of fruit and herbs. What's better than strawberry? Strawberry with basil, that's what! They're always refreshing and never too sweet. The only problem is that the cappuccino is so good I can rarely bring myself to try all the other flavors of Italian soda.",5
2653,"I had two iMacs that decided to take poop at the same time.  While freaking out because of no access to the endeared interwebs, I had my wife drop the family computer over for evaluation.  Within about 3 mins, Bob (the owner) let her know that it was a hard drive malfunction.  They both called me on the phone and he gave me options, especially due to my iMac being 10 years old.  

Two days later, I personally dropped off the other one and spoke to his technician and basically the same thing happened. We agreed to have a new hard drive placed and it would be ready the same day.  He called me that afternoon letting me know it was ready, but I was too far away to get there by closing time.

Went back on that Monday morning and met Bob and went over everything and he had my computer working like a dream.  While I was waiting for them to get it all ready to go, he change the battery in my iPhone as well.

Bob and company were fabulous and I recommend them to everyone.  Thanks for the help.",5
2654,"We love this place.  My daughter can run around the picnic tables and we can bring the dog too.  Our dog enjoys hitting the nearby dog park afterwards too.  

I don't think I've had anything on the menu that I didn't like.  I like the fontina burger, the portobello mushroom sandwich with the green goddess dressing (yum), and the BBQ chicken pizza.  I also love that I can get the fresh beet salad with blue cheese in place of french fries.  I really don't have anything negative to say about it other than the drive.  We live about 45 minutes away, but still make a point of going there as often as we can.",5
2655,"My family and I  love the food, service is awesome I can't get enough of this place especially their passion fruit drink!!!! I strongly reccomend this place to anyone",5

2658,"I received a message from Bill the new general manager shortly after my review to get in touch with him so I called him back. He was very nice and extended out a sincere apology for the experience I had and wanted to know all that happened and offered to make it up to me if I come back and give them another chance. Like I said in my review, we enjoyed ourselves dancing so it was just the service that was bad so I told him I'll get back to him after I talk to my friends for our next girls night out outing as we were planning on another in a month for 2 of the girls birthdays coming up anyways. 

Well, we decided to go ahead and go to Cadillac Ranch again and Bill said he'll make sure everything goes smoothly for us and he'll treat us to champagne and appetizers on him and get us a table for the group. 

There were about 11 of us that showed up for dinner and about another 12+ who later showed up for dancing. Bill not only made sure that we had Liz our waitress who was sweet, excellent and tentative in making sure we had drinks, waters, etc throughout the whole night but he also had a security watching our tables so we were well taken care of as promised.  We definitely had the VIP red carpet treatment. You won us over and we will be returning for more girls night out in the future. Thanks again for a pleasant experience and doing all you can to making this 2nd visit an enjoyable one. My girlfriends & I all agree, you went above and beyond expectations and we were very impressed and thank you for a great fun night.",5
2660,what is it with Wendys ?  They never get the orders right. If any of the employees would smile I would die from shock.  This review applies to many of the Wendys  that I have been to. Even in Florida.  Do they train them to be rude and ignorant ?,1
2661,Excellent food! Excellent service! Babystacks is the best breakfast establishment in all of Las Vegas. The chicken fried steak is one of the best I've had in 20 years being in Las Vegas and the seasoned potatoes were very tasty. The cowboy skillet is awesome!,5
2663,Actually called Fresh Buy Market now. Love this place! Best priced produce and Asian supplies in the area. Such friendly staff!,5
2664,"I'm from Toronto and the pie here is better on my opinion.  The truffle honey is Amaze balls!

So glad I tried this place out.",5
2665,Very delicious and palatable restaurant. Definitely worth a visit! Order the lamb and also the fish!,5
2668,"We went to satisfy our taco craving. They stated its 1$ on sunday so we we went crazy. Turned out to be 3$ for the beef. We paid $50 for our night. We could have had a much better dinner elsewhere for that price. Manager said that the waitress should have told us the 'fine print'. He was too busy on the phone to address us. Needless to say, we'll never step foot in this chain again.",1
2669,"I'm not vegetarian but I tried the vegan dogs on my last visit and I think they're as good, if not better, than the meat versions!  There's no reason to get the meat ones again, definitely sticking with the plant-based versions from now on.  Thanks for the good food!",5
2670,"Love this place! I've been to several studios throughout the valley and have often felt like the other students were very advanced and the instructors expected me to keep up and rarely would stop to help me with my posture/pose. At Vibetality all of the instructors are amazing and so helpful, they make you feel very comfortable in every class and actually teach you!",5
2674,"Routine maintenance to attic AC .Ceiling damaged.Took pic and sent company.Owner very rude,disruptive.not their problem.2 days later water leak coming from AC puddling in ceiling damage area and hall ceiling light under AC.They were only one in attic.Only ones to do preventive maintenance twice per yr since installed.Told would have someone call.It was a Fri before holiday wkend.No call.I called 6p Fri and spoke w/answering service.1 hr later tech showed. Admitted their fault.Unit somehow misaligned.Wanted to charge for service call. I refused.Left w/duct insulation wet.Would have someone call following Tues.I had to follow up.Owner called.Would have someone call to schedule fixing wet insulation.Again,even though water leak their problem,ceiling damage not their problem and stated AC unit out of warranty I should have paid for Fri follow up visit to fix water problem! Never called back.I elected to have all repaired by competent company at my expense. In last 5 yrs gave them business for 2 new heating units and 3 new ac's.Never again!",1
2675,"Exemplary in every way! I reserved only about a week in advance. Despite what I later learned was their very busy schedule, they made time for loading our pod for a late afternoon. Communication throughout was prompt and clear. Ben and Brady performed the move and were courteous, efficient, and professional. The rate was more than fair considering the hassle-free experience. I recommend.",5
2676,"We ordered a regular burger, fries, & their specialty beer.

It tasted amazing!!! Would rate it as high as In n Out burger.

The only downside of this place is that it is crowded & it is hard to find seating.

Everything else... 5 stars!!",5
2677,"There are whole bunch of problems and the maintenance takes forever. Unfriendly office staff. Bad living experience. 

First they didn't clean our carpet before we moved in. Our apartment had mold in the bathroom. The elevator broke often!! We were stuck in it for AN HOUR but couldn't do anything about it. Recently, there is a pipe leak in our wall and we are sleeping in the living room everyday. They left us a hole in the wall, and chemical smell bedroom. Problems do happen because it is an old building, but if their management just show some care and do their job, I don't think it would make us feel so bad.

Anyway, if you want to live here, I would say just pray nothing happens in your apt.",1
2682,"As good as it gets. I've never had mole this good. Ever. 

The Tamal Oaxacaeno is absurd. The Tlayudas are unreal. 

Someone pinch me, I'm dreaming. 

Next time someone tries to tell you that San Diego has better Mexican food than Phoenix, remind them that La 15 y Salsas exists, and end the argument. 

As good a meal as you'll ever eat.",5
2683,"Absolutely love this park.

Basically there couldn't be much to change between parks here in town, right? Only this one feels better than others!
The playground is great, suitable for younger and older kids. The grass around it is awesome, my son run around and loved every second of it. 
The area itself is cool too, gorgeous mountain view! 
There are two sitting areas, one right next to the playground and another one next to the baseball area. 
Bottom line, if you live in the area you're a mom who's looking for a new park, this is a great place to go to.",5
2684,Can't miss with the gator bites or the gumbo. Everyone's plate around us looked like you wanted to ask for a bite. You MUST try the blue crab omelet.,5
2685,"Nothing negative to say:

Delicious carne asada, cabeza, pollo, lengua...so many reviews that only talk about JUST the carne asada. The menu is a bit more expansive than that. Minus the tripe (not a fan of it), there isn't anything on the menu I wouldn't recommend. Brought some foody friends here who know a good eat and they were very skeptical at the idea of arguably the best Mex in Phoenix being out of a truck. After some burritos and tacos, the critics were silenced. If you're in the area and you don't stop here, you are doing both yourself and your wallet a disservice.",5
2686,What a wonderful store the sales people there were so kind and helpful and I found everything I was looking for it's nice to be living close to a Macy's and the shopping center its its in or mall I should say can't wait to explore it,5
2693,Awesome place!! Speedy service!! The gentlemen that work here are nice and friendly. Definitely will come back for another latte. I Might have a hard time not getting the vanilla sugar latte again but will try something else next time..,5
2696,"This is my second time visiting this restaurant, and I must say that I admire the consistency. The carne asada was marinated and grilled to perfection and their campechano tacos tasted authentic which is something that I've been looking for in the Phoenix valley. Along with the consistency of their food, this place has a list of artisan tequilas, mezcals, and other Mexican spirits. I highly recommend grabbing a seat at the bar and asking one of the knowledgeable bartenders to give you an exploratory adventure through their premium agave spirits. If you are a connoisseur of craft spirits, you will not be disappointed. 

The price point of the tacos here represents the quality of their products as well as the phenomenal preparation. This is not the place to go if you are looking for a quick cheap taco that costs less than 2 dollars. These tacos are 3.50 each, or you can get a family style dish served on a hot plate with a side of 6 corn tortillas. I recommend the second option, because you are going to want to order more as soon as you put down the first round of tacos. The preparation time for these tacos take time, so patience is essential, but as I keep saying it will be worth every minute and penny.

The ambiance of this place is what you would expect for a hip upscale taco shop nestled in the Roosevelt community. It looks like it's a historical building that was completely gutted and renovated with a fresh wood interior. The open ceiling and floor to ceiling windows produces a warm community-like environment that makes you want to walk around to other tables and make friends. The bar is neatly organized and creates an eye-catching display of all the artisan spirits available for tasting. The exterior of the building adds to the ambiance by remaining to keep its vintage look. 

The service is exceptional. Both times I have visited I have sat at the bar. The first time I enjoyed a great mescal that was recommended. (I forget the name, but will be back to get it again.) My girlfriend got a margarita that was balanced to perfection. To eat, I first tried the carne asada tacos and immediately fell in love. I ordered a second round of carne asada and also sampled the campechano which I fell in love with as well. My girlfriend tried the Naco Torta and was more than satisfied. Naco Torta consisted of fresh, ripe avocado, tender carne asada marinated to perfection, an over medium egg, and greens all on a toasted artisan bun. After all of this food, I couldn't help but order the churros with 3 different dipping sauces. The churros were crispy on the outside with a warm fluffy, but dense inside. I personally enjoyed the chocolate dipping sauce, but it also came with a leche, and caramel sauce.

Overall I highly recommend this place to anyone in the Phoenix community. I will now be a loyal customer to this reastaurant because of the quality and consistency of the food, service and of course tequila.",5
2698,"I will not be returning here again! The service is terrible, it took two people to run run a register and one was a manager. Neither one knew what they were doing, the salad bar appeared as if it was left out over night.The pizza didn't look any better. The sweet was boiling hot and the restroom was filthy and looked and smelled as if it hadn't been cleaned in days. Don't waste your time or money here.",1
2700,"Bummed!! Tried this place twice now, after reading all these good reviews I figured my first experience must had been a fluke so I went back to give it another try... Unfortunately my second experience was even worse. This place is ran by young kids who are sweet, but very unorganized and careless. Shouting across tables in this tiny restaurant  to ask where the missing food is, and an obvious lack of professionalism, which makes their extra long wait time akward and uncomfortable. There is no music playing or anything to distract you, and sitting under bright fluorescent lights unfortunately just really adds to the akward vibe. Now the important part is, if the food was good I could care less about an akward vibe... But the food is not good. Or fresh :( My vegetables and meat tasted and looked OLD both times I visited. I really wanted to like this place and gave it a second try, hoping the second time would be better than the first. But both times I was beyond let down. If you want fresh quality ingredients,  a clean and nice vibe, this is not your spot.",1
2701,"Great food, music, atmosphere. Check out their daily specials. On lightrail.",5
2703,"Wonderful meal! The rack of lamb was perfectly cooked and so tender. The crab and scallop risotto was delicious. Started with a fab Giada's Fav antipasto. Nice Tuscany wine selection, reds were tasty. All that was left of the lemon bundt cake dessert were crumbs. This place met our expectations, a bit pricey, but worth every bite! The service was great, especially from Ron and his crew. We will be back!",5
2704,"This is a warning about this company, which seems to also be connected with MD Labs and some sort of supplement called ""The Stuff.""  It is a fraud.  How do I know?  Because, if you try to take advantage of their customer satisfaction guarantee, guess where your request for a refund goes?  That would be straight to my P.O. box.

I am not affiliated with these people whatsoever and, if you have been ripped off by them, I suggest contacting your Better Business Bureau.  I have had my current box for over three years, and as of yet they have not changed the information on their labels.  As for your refund requests, any that are sent to my box are promptly destroyed.  It is sad that you are being ripped off by this company, but it is also sad that you are gullible enough to believe their outrageous claims on their products, when if you read the fine print on the label it even admits that it's B.S. 

So, save your money and, seriously, think twice about ever falling for herbal supplement claims.  You're just throwing your money down a black hole and potentially damaging what health you may have.",1
2707,"Run to the Hash Kitchen and get yourself to the Bloody Mary Bar!! 

Great atmosphere, friendly and helpful staff, and superb food! 

Loved this place! My dad and I went for Sunday Brunch after a beautiful morning hike and it was just what we needed to re-energize! 

The Bloody Mary bar was top notch! So many choices and all so tasty! I would really go back just for endless cocktails.

I got the Huevos Rancheros Skillet and dad got Chicken and Waffles and I discovered looking around, you really can't make a bad decision! Be warned as our waiter did for us: you WILL be in a good coma after your visit!",5
2710,"This place is awesome. Been here twice now and the prices and employees are great.  

After giving your info and checking if they left you into the showroom\sales floor with a number. You can look around the very nice room's many display cases of products while waiting for your number to be called. 

The employees are all very well dressed (dress shirts, ties, vests, etc) and are very friendly and knowledgeable. Both employees I dealt with were patient and did not rush as I asked multiple questions about products. They make great suggestions about strains and variations. 

After visiting another dispensary I found the Apothecary Shoppe has great prices and much lower than the place I went across town. $12 grams versus $27 for a similar strand of bud and pre-rolls were about $6-8 cheaper here too. I'll be back for sure.",5
2712,I have salmon at least twice a week each time at a different restauarant so you can call me a salmon connoisseur. Had the salmon here for dinner. It was really good. I'd recommend it.,5
2715,"R.I.P Nosh!  We have been stopping to eat here for years and someone had the bright idea to change the sandwiches and managed to destroy what was the best turkey, bacon, Swiss sandwich in Vegas.  Also changed the coleslaw, which was delicious,  to some spicy slop.  BTW, BLT sandwiches are not supposed to be served piping hot and if you say applewood bacon on the menu it should also be on the sandwich.  Time to find a new deli in Vegas because Nosh is dead to me.",1

2718,"Siobhan was my initial sales rep. She made everything sound good, charged me as agreed including installation and then on delivery day, they just dumped the bed on me and ran, no installation or removing of packing materials.

I phoned and was told I hadn't paid for installation. The warehouse manager was rude to begin with, but more on that in a bit. I had paid for installation and e-mailed Sam at the store, the invoice showing the charge equal to 10% of the cost of the bed shown as installation charge. Sam was not nice about it either.

The warehouse manager wanted me to pay $80 for installation - if he did me a favour and sent a freelancer to do the job that evening. He was downright insulting in the way he spoke - like I was trying to get something for nothing. His ego was apparently hurt because he was proved wrong in that I had indeed paid for delivery - so to spite me, he specifically asked the assembly guy to not touch the assembly of the bar stools and not take away any of the packing materials including those of the bed - the first was told to me by the assembly guy and the latter by EQ3 customer service!

I spoke with David at the warehouse who was much more of a gentleman. Camille at the store took over from Sam and she too was more pleasant. They have promised to clean up the old mess left behind (which my aged father and I had to cut and store in the garage) and both deliver and install my sofas coming next week with no traces of packing materials left behind, for which they initially wanted an additional $60 and another $25 to screw in the legs of the sofa despite the sales invoice having these included.

I have cancelled the coffee table order I placed with Guenet subsequently, as I never want to deal with these people again.

Siobhan never spoke with me or returned my phone calls throughout the process, as these salespeople don't want to face the music after they have promised something and not delivered. While I don't play games, I do know how these people play the game. They can't always be busy with customers to not be able to come to the phone or return calls.

I would rather go to UpCountry nearby the King Street EQ3 store.",1
2720,"Never crowded, always fashionable facilities. I love coming to the gym now. They validate parking for two hours and are in the same building as whole foods. Basically perfect.",5
2721,"There was nothing bad about our recent trip to Montys,   Driving home from skiing decided to off the beaten path, tired of bad chain restaurants.   So glad we did.   Started off with Bloody Mary's while we waited for a table.  We had a group of 10 and it was a little cramped while waiting, but drink in hand-so who cares?!   I ordered the burger and fries,  excellent.   Melted cheddar in top.   Hubby ordered the meat loaf stack- he cleaned his plate.  Several of the others ordered Mac and cheese and milk shakes!   I had no idea they were so large,  you may want to consider sharing a milk shake, seriously enormous.   Friendly service,  excellent food!",5
2722,"Getting a massage at the Ritz-Carlton was an amazing and luxurious experience. I came to my massage very early to enjoy the facilities (mostly the pool and jacuzzi). There are waiting rooms where you can read a magazine, enjoy the fruit, and have some tea (it was so good that I ordered some later). The bathrooms have lockers and lots of toiletries. There are many products from Clarins that you can sample. For my massage, I ordered a 90-min deep tissue massage, plus an additional 15 minutes of the foot ritual. The massage therapist was excellent, and even showed me particular stretches for helping to remove muscle tension at the end. The deep tissue massage can be painful, and is meant to be more therapeutic, so try something else if you are aiming more for relaxation (i.e. hot stone massage).",5
2723,"I moved into this complex last year, and it's been an amazing experience. It's a small grouping of townhome apartments, and it's smack dab in the middle of the entire Arrowhead area. The front office folks are very nice, and service requests are all handled quickly. It's also nice to have a garage, although they are honestly a necessity as the main downside to this complex is a distinct lack of visitor parking. Putting my car in the garage frees up my driveway for one visitor, but the public parking beyond that is close to nonexistent.

I honestly have had no problems here. I needed a place to stay and save up some money towards a down payment on my own home for a year, and Bella Vista fit that bill very nicely. I would recommend it highly to anybody searching for an apartment.",5
2724,"Horrible experience, the staff was extremely rude, couldn't even ask for a pitcher of water without an eye roll. NEVER going back!!",1
2726,Another fabulous dinner. Great service. I don't even utilize the outstanding salad bar. I do love the potatoes au gratin and lobster bisque.,5
2727,I LOVE Veltre's! The pizza is always so good and we can't go there without getting some Italian dogs to take home. Never had a bad meal and I highly recommend them!,5
2728,"Love this lounge!! Great place to watch your favorite games and then turns into a great lounge at night with a DJ Thursday-Sunday! Live music on Tuesdays and they're always giving out two for one coupons on well drinks. Yes the prices are a little higher than usual, but it's also the Bellagio, a five star, Forbes rated hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. Nice place to visit if you don't want to do the nightclub option.",5
2729,"Yum!  Rita's was a really delicious treat on a hot summer day.  I got pineapple ice with vanilla soft serve (which is different than any other soft serve I've had - it's really fluffy!) while the husband tried birthday cake ice with chocolate soft serve.  The young man working the counter immediately offered samples when we walked in, which I took advantage of before making my flavor choice.  We will definitely be back to try more!",5
2730,"Food was.....fod. 'NEVER coming back because of the uneasy feeling that they may have RE-USED a cut  english muffin for my Eggs Benedict. I feel I ATE SOMEONE ELSE'S THROW-AWAY. I explained to the Chef that an english muffin shouldn't be split especially when my other benedeict had a whole english muffin. Disgusting! The Chef kept saying that they dont do that and that he stands at the line and watches the cooks cook all day. Umm, poor use of labor and salary, I feel. I'm in the hospitality industry and that isn't how that job position works.  Server, Emilia was nice and the manager, Fran was empathic. I wouldn't be typing this if the Chef would just say he would talk with his crew or look into it even if he felt that it wasn't recycled english muffin. No thanks.",1

2737,"This really hurts my heart to be writing a review like this because Pin Kaow WAS my favorite restaurant but unfortunately I don't think that we will be returning anymore.

We have been going to Pin Kaow every week religiously for the past 9 years. We were going there when it was just the one restaurant on North Rainbow Blvd.The service was always great and the food was even better, the kicker though, was the prices, they couldn't be beat. This is what truly set them apart from all the other Thai places.
Unfortunately, I feel like  they have become more ""corporate"" like these days.As time went on I watched the prices go up multiple times and watched the portions get smaller and smaller. They even got rid of their cute little uniforms that they had which was such a nice added touch to the experience.
But we still stood by them as we were always a loyal customer.

For the past year my co workers and I have been going to the one on Eastern every week on our lunch hour.
 
Last week as always, we went in and ordered our chicken fried rice and shrimp fried rice lunch special. 30 minutes later we got our food, at this time we placed an order for another shrimp fried rice lunch special to go. It took 45 minutes for us to receive the food. Keep in mind they only had 3 other tables in the restaurant filled at this time. 
We had to ask them TWICE about the to go order in which 30 minutes later the waitress comes up to the table to tell us that the order had been placed. EXCUSE ME?! 30 minutes and 2 times checking and the order was JUST placed? The only response that we get is a shrug of the shoulder with a smug sorry to go along with it, as if we did something wrong.
Needless to say, we were over 30 minutes late getting back to the office as we only have 1 hour for our lunch break.

TODAY, we decided to give them another shot as mistakes and bad days do happen. Well it just about felt like groundhog day because here we go again.

We place our order of Crab Rangoon, and 3 lunch specials with another order of the Chicken fried rice lunch special to go.
15 minutes later we were eating our Crab Rangoon with our soup that went with the lunch special that followed. The only problem was......our lunch specials never came.
45 minutes later and with our lunch break being over we got up to ask them what was going on with our food, as we were watching the other tables that had arrived 25 minutes after us enjoy their lunch. The lady at the front said that she would check and then she never reported back to us. 
10 minutes later we checked on it again and they simply just handed us the bill with no explanation and no food. We tell her to pack up our orders as there is no possible way for us to be able to sit and eat as we are already late. 

We get back to the office, keep in mind that we are now trying to have a bite here and there in between our patients and our food was not even sub par...... NOT AT ALL. It tasted like it had been sitting there for hours, my shrimp in the fried rice was dried out the pad thai had no flavor and the chicken fried rice was floating in grease. It was pretty much inedible. Needless to say we all ended up throwing our food out. 

My co worker then called the restaurant to complain and was basically given the cold shoulder. They again were acting as if WE did something wrong. We were told to bring the food back to the restaurant (because we all have time in the world to run around town bringing food back and fourth during our work day after already being late to work because they couldn't get their act together). 
We told them that we couldn't do that,  after hearing all the  himing and hawing and being put on hold multiple times she told us that when we came back they would give us 15% off of our next bill. REALLY?!? We wasted our hour long lunch, gas money and our money on food that we ended up throwing out and you are giving us attitude as you offer us 15%. 

REALLY? PLEASE!!! AIN'T NOBODY GOT TIME FOR THAT!!",1
2738,I stumbled upon this cute nail salon. Not only were their services at a reasonable price .  I got my  nails done by a woman named Loan. She's very good! Thank you Loan for cleaning up my broken and  cracked nails.,5

The salon itself was bright and welcoming . Fidel worked wonders with my hair, making sure I was satisfied with every step of the process.

2744,Overall probably our most favorite place to go to eat as a family. Everybody has their favorite entree and the service is always great. Knowing what to get and how to order it makes this restaurant A constant go to for us. The food is always the same tastes great good value good atmosphere.,5
2747,"Had a great experience on Saturday. Our server was very attentive and constantly checking in to make sure that our service and food were good. Everything was handled in a timely fashion (seating, drinks, food) and our server was very friendly. We will definitely come back again!",5
2748,"As a newer Yelper, this is only my second review and beyond deserved.  On our most recent trip to Las Vegas last weekend, my boyfriend and I ended up unexpectedly at Mastro's Ocean Club in Crystals inside City Center for the first time.  We go to Vegas quite a bit (about once every 2 months or so) and have passed by this place quite a few times.  

The interestingly constructed architecture of the main dining area has been quite the source of amusement to us in the past... it resembles something like the shell of a wooden submarine that has exit chutes above and below it to spit you out into Crystals when you are done with your meal (btw, this is a joke.  You do not get ejected from your seat.  It is only my strange sense of humor that comes up with this stuff).  My imaginative uses for the architecture aside, the design/layout is nice; it makes you feel as if the restaurant is floating in the middle of Crystals with a very open and airy feel.

As we were walking through Crystals on our way back to our hotel room at Aria from a long day of shopping, we decided to make an impromptu stop at the ejection submarine and see if there was any chance they would take us as walk-ins on a busy Friday night.  With it being such an upscale spot, I was sure we would either be turned away without a reservation or asked to wait for a ridiculous amount of time.  Au contraire!  They offered us immediate seating in the bar/lounge area or a few minute wait for the main dining room.  Since we felt a bit underdressed for the location, we opted for the bar/lounge area and were glad we did.  We had the perfect seat right next to the piano player and fiery red-headed chanteuse, who was pleasantly entertaining. 

We were promptly greeted by our amazing server, Sara.  The only reason I know her name is because I made sure to ask her for it when we were leaving as I knew I wanted to review this place.  Sara was so attentive, knowledgeable about menu, friendly, and always two steps ahead of us -  really as perfect as a server can get.  All of her recommendations were great as well.

I had the swordfish (I hadnt met my mercury quota for the month yet) and my boyfriend had the bone-in Ribeye.  We shared the most delicious side dish - the Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi.  My swordfish paired very well with gnocchi and it was the perfect combo of light and creamy.  However, my boyfriend's Ribeye wasnt anything stellar.  It wasnt as flavorful as a most quality Ribeyes should be.  It's on our do-not-order-again list.  This is an ""Ocean Club"" though so maybe that was his error for ordering one of the few non-seafood options.  Now,  for the absolute BEST part of the meal.... THE MOST HEAVENLY DESSERT EVER - Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake.  Even if the rest of the meal and service had been horrible, which it was far from, I would have given this place 5 stars just for this dessert!  I dreamt about this cake the rest of our stay in Vegas and cant wait to go back again on our next trip just to have it.  This creation alone makes Mastro's Ocean Club one of my top 5 all-time favorite restaurants.  I would happily get ejected from this sea-faring vessel any time! ;)

Sorry for the ridiculously long review, but I had so much to comment on and didnt know where to shorten it.",5
2749,"Ugh. Outside of getting our order wrong, their ""extra large"" pizza was not so extra large. In addition, it was gross. Not nearly enough sauce or cheese, and scant toppings. Wow....super disappointed. The wings were passable, but barely. Also, no carrots or celery. Amateur league, guys. Seriously...",1
2750,"I have had two encounters with Pandora and have heard about a few more. I usually do not give only one stars,however  after the 2nd encounter I feel that I should give honest feedback about my experience.  I will try not to go into too much detail. There was an issue about what information  I was given and when I tried to confirm  the information  I was told and I quote ""if I don't like it ,then don't come back. I was absolutely  appalled so I called  and got the owner. He tried to assure me that customer service was important. I said ok, I will  give it a second  chance.  This is where it gets worse. A friend called in to ask questions about cupcakes. The lady was so rude to her, over talked her and the had the audacity to announce she was the owner very smart Ackley  and basically  if she didn't care for what she said nonthing was going to be done. ""Don't buy from us,  it is the way it is"". Now I understand rules what I don't understand is rudeness I don't understand how you own a business and yet you have rude customer service that's two times that I have rude customer service have Pandora I will not go back to Pandora cupcakes and I know I only have one voice however my voice counts. They are not friendly people to deal with and obviously they don't care truly about customer service because their rudeness was unbelievable.  Fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me!",1
2752,"We came here with another couple to try our first 3 star michelin restaurant.  Food was great, presentation was tremendous, but the portions were small. 

We actually didn't get the full tasting menu because we had to catch a Cirque du Soleil Show.  If I were to go back, I'd do the tasting menu, so I wouldn't have to go to Panda Express to fill the belly afterward.

Bread platter was really tastey!",5
2753,"I took my 3 year old grandson & 1 year old granddaughter for an afternoon.  It was a great time.  The tall slide is fast and fun.  My  grandson was able to maneuver himself in the climbing nets and jumping areas.  The big draw was the climbing wall.  The gentleman working was more than happy to put the climbing belt on him and give him the basics of climbing.  My grandson loved it.  There is an area for little tykes like my 1 year old.  She had a good time in the baby play area that was more mellow.  There are arcade games and a concession area for lunch.  Everything seemed in tip top shape.  They offer kids foods like mac & cheese, lunchables, hot dogs, nachos, ice cream, juice, milk & more.  The staff was very attentive.  They were very happy and helpful.  We had a great time.  We will go again.",5
2754,"I'm not one to complain, but they have given me the worst pizza delivery I have ever experienced.  Pizza was delivered 25 minutes after what they estimated.  That I can deal with.  However, after opening the pizza box, it was wrong: it was missing ingredients and meat was on the whole pizza when we ordered it only on half because we have a vegetarian in the house.  We also ordered garlic knots that arrived much too undercooked to even eat, and marinara sauce was missing.  

I should have checked before the delivery driver left.  Anyway, I contacted them to request the correct pizza be delivered or for a refund.  I was told I wouldn't receive a refund unless the entire wrong pizza was returned first.  Too bad two pieces had already been eaten!  Thankfully, Eat24 stepped in and had the correct pizza delivered, but by that time we had lost our appetite and the terrible service left a bad taste in our mouths.  

Listen to the reviews on here to avoid going through what many here have.  Very disappointed in my experience.",1
2755,"My husband and I have been looking for a reliable used vehicle that will be eventually passed down to our teenage daughter. We found a Toyota Highlander at Lexus and my husband took it for a test drive. He had his eye on something else but after much debate, we decided to return and re-test the car out later that evening..close to closing time. When we walked in, we were greeted by Cliff, he wasn't the person who my husband seen earlier in the day but Cliff had already said to us how he wanted to reach that person and see if he wanted to come in to take care of us or if he wanted Cliff to tend to us. After a few phone calls Cliff found the vehicle and we took it for a ride. The car was in amazing shape and Cliff had me, my husband and my daughter cracking up the whole time. He's a character! Long story short what began as two weeks of stress, pushy sales men that made us feel like they were the mob, to salesmen who wouldn't return calls, we ended up finding the perfect sales staff and perfect car!
They have a wonderful group of gentlemen at Lexus of Henderson. 
I mean absolutely wonderful, old fashioned, stand up for a lady, open doors for a lady, please and thank you gentlemen who made us feel right at home. 

Even though we bought a used car, they treated us like we were buying a top of the line Lexus  
From Cliff, to the gentlemen with a European accent to Richard in  finance, they all stayed past closing to wait for us and just treated me and my family as if we were family! And that made up for the fact that we live all the way in NW vegas, 45 mins from this dealership. 
If highly recommend swinging by to experience how car buying should be! No pressure, just wonderful customer service. Thank you Lexus if Henderson for showing me that purchasing a car shouldn't have to be stressful",5

The family that runs the restaurant greets us with such enthusiasm each time we come. Be sure to ask the waitress for recommendations.  Let us recommend some dishes.  For appetizers, try Tom Kha Gai (#9) or Yum Woon Sen (#16).  The Pho Do Bien (#51) is a no brainier.  Totally addictive.  They have a dish nicknamed ""drunken noodle"" that is off the hook good.  Don't remember the number though.  The curry dishes are awesome.  Try them as-is.  This is an authentic Vietnamese restaurant so they turn up the heat.",5
2765,"Had to try Graze from a recommendation from a friend who was out on business as well previously. Three of us walked in on a Wednesday night and got a reservation right away even though the place had a good crowd. We tried some specialty drinks which were very good and also some wine. We shared the nachos to start which were very good. For entree's we had the burger, the chicken and waffles, and the macaroni and cheese with the pulled pork on top. We all thoroughly enjoyed the food, service, and atmosphere. I will be returning my next time in town.",5

Dr. Cheever is a big believer in the idea that kids should not be traumatized by the dentist.  He allows them to run around the office, play with the chairs to see how they work, and the uses good verbal and nonverbal techniques.  

Son had to have a tooth pulled and doesn't have any issues in returning.  Daughter had a cavity filled and again no issues.  Daughter sees the health district building (where they give vaccines) and turns around to run away.  Neither kids think that way about the dentist and I am forever grateful.",5

Luckily I stumbled upon predator's number and spoke to Lars and explained what I was looking for. He said he knew exactly what I needed and I could stop by at anytime to pick it up. Guess what? It was only $25! Not only was it literally a fraction of the price but once I arrived Lars had cut an extra piece for me (in case I messed up my DIY project), he also came out to my car and gave me a couple pointers on installing it. This is what small business and customer service are about.",5
2776,"I was excited for my first trip to Isabel's Amor.  The new restaurant looked sharp.  We sat on the patio on a beautiful Arizona day.  I was with friends and we all had one of their unique cocktails.  The drinks were classics with nice little twists to make them special.  We enjoyed them.  The food was very good.  I had the Carnitas.  I was impressed with the quality and preparation. I should mention the chips and salsa are addicting!  Perfect spot to meet friends for drinks/apps or take the family for dinner.  Go to this restaurant, you will enjoy your experience.",5

I love the owners! They are extremely accommodating and friendly. 

Highly recommend: Bibimbap and Pork Bone Soup. Make sure to try their glass noodle sides!

Taste: really authentic. No MSG or artificial sauces. 

This is definitely one of the restaurants I frequent on a weekly basis.",5
2781,"$4.98 three pound rotisserie chickens are a major enticement at Sam's Club. On 4/22/2018 I renewed my membership and drove 17 miles for the primary purpose of bringing one home to enjoy. When doors opened at 10AM, I headed straight for chicken. 100% empty shelves! Ovens behind the shelves indicated chickens might be available in 35 minutes. Then I went to Customer Service. Despite a very long line of customers, they had 1 clerk on duty. I drove home and tried to cancel membership by online chat, by email & by phone. After 16 minutes on the phone, I was told that Sam's could not refund to my credit card, which is never disclosed on Sam's website or anywhere else. It says ""we'll refund in full the actual amount you paid"" on Terms & Conditions page.  As a consumer advocate & journalist, I documented everything in writing and with photos.

This is my go-to place to watch a movie. 
I especially love the cozy atmosphere of the theatres and also the fact that they don't blare the sound so loud like the other monster theatres. If you're sound sensitive like me and you want to keep your hearing intact, you will sure enjoy your movie experience here.",5
2784,"This place has been a regular destination for us in Cleveland for over a decade now, and it continues to be a restaurant we recommend without hesitation.  A huge vegetarian, vegan, and specialty menu, decidedly friendly to those with specific culinary needs (i.e. no gluten, etc.), which succeeds in not isolating those folks who experience the onset of panic when ""vegetarian"" is mentioned.  Yes, meat does exist here, and yes, I'm sure it's tastily cooked and presented as well.

We pretty much only ever get the same meal when we come here, which is ridiculous due to the massive selection available.  The ""Ceebee"" is freaking delicious, however, and I drool when thinking about it: pita stuffed with falafel, hummus, bean sprouts, cheese, and some other wonderful things, all heated together.  I'm glad that there's only two portions included in the meal, as I could probably gorge myself sick on this stuff.

I'm a big fan of Tommy's hummus, as well, which one can purchase as its own plate in either the normal or ""spiked"" variety (which features everything from BBQ sauce to the moon, apparently).  I tend to get the normal hummus plate, sometimes with cheese, to split with friends, and we're rarely disappointed.  When I ate there recently, however, the hummus wasn't as up to par as it normally is - I suppose everyone has their off days.

Snag a booth to eat in if you can, as it enhances the overall aesthetic of the place - wood polished by the feet and rears of thousands, random plants everywhere, easy access to the bookstore next door, show and concert posters crammed onto the wall in the entry foyer.  Generally, Tommy's is clean, well-lit, small group/family-friendly, and satisfying to the stomach.  The servers are hit or miss, as the place tends to employ its share of hipster kids, who can either be friendly or awkwardly removed from normal social niceties.  We've rarely had an issue with that, however.

Recommended.",5
2785,"This is my dream diner: cozy, friendly, delicious. The staff is incredibly friendly and knew tons of the customers by name. Sometimes close-knit places like that can feel unwelcoming to outsiders, but they made me feel right at home, even offering me a fresh out-of-the-oven gingerbread cookie while I waited for my food. I had country poached eggs on jalapeno cornbread, which was fantastic. Cornbread was on the moist side but it worked with the dish overall. Good-sized portion but not outrageous. I'm definitely going back.",5

Cute outside seating, cozy rustic inside, and the customer service was top notch. Visited on a Sunday and it wasn't crazy busy but there were about 4 tables filled inside, while only 1 table, besides mine was taken outside. Ordered the iced Mojito Green Tea, and got too excited when I saw a gluten free peanut butter bar! Yesssss and it was OH SO DELICIOUS! Definitely the perfect spot for relaxing, getting work done, reading a book. This is not a place for a massive study group but stop in being 3 friends and order that peanut butter bar!

2791,Just got back from dinner. Nine of us went. It was Mexican night and two of us got the taco. It was shaped like a burrito and they were mainly filled with lettuce. One was with chicken and the other was with shrimp. Both were very bland. Two people got the chicken fajitas and there was hardly any chicken and also very bland. One crusted perch sandwich was ordered and the fillet was so small it could have been eaten in one bite. A taco sub was ordered and there was almost no beef on it.  Very disappointing. The only two items that were acceptable were the steak salad and the enchilada. Our service was great and everyone was very friendly. Probably will not be going back.,1

Being an avid espresso drinker I decided to check this place out when I was passing by the neighbourhood. When ordering I was taken by surprise that for a 'simple' espresso cup I had three options in terms of flavour. I can't remember which fancy one I chose but damn, that thing was good! 

I'll come back to try the others and some of their food too, at which point I'll provide an updated review.",5
2796,"I was really excited about the bagel factory opening in Oakland as I love bagels.  I purchased the Groupon back in July and was told that it would open August 1.  It didn't open until September, and, when it did, they didn't accept the Groupon, though they assured me it would be accepted soon.  I understood, and was happy enough to wait, as the food was ok, and the coffee excellent, but a few weeks later I got an e-mail from Groupon informing me that the Oakland location would ""no longer"" be accepting the Groupon.  No longer?  I visited several times, including the day before this e-mail, and was informed every time that it would be accepted in the near future!

Besides this awful customer service and false advertising, they recently revoked their policy granting free refills on for-here coffee, as found at all locations serving Coffee Tree Roasters coffee.  This, combined with their ridiculously high prices for ""real"" food will make this an infrequent stop for this Pittsburgher.",1

Suarez bakery is a cute little spot located right near BlackHawk hardware in Park Road Shopping. They have multiple cases of desserts ranging from large cakes to cookies to cupcakes.

On this particular occasion, I got the red velvet cupcake and the cheesecake that had little heart sprinkles on it. The cupcake was delish! The icing was super sweet, maybe a bit too sweet for me. The cheesecake was amazing. Typically, I am a one bite girl with desserts....as in, one bite, and I don't really need any more. However, I think I ate half of this small cheesecake! The crust was amazing!

Perfect Valentines Day sweets!",5

2802,"In 10 years, I think I have only written 2 or 3 reviews on Yelp.  A place has to either really, really bad or really, really good to make me want to write a review. 

Unfortunately, this place is horrible.  The meat was all the left over stuff that you might feed a dog, all fat and parts of the chicken I couldn't even recognize.  I could barely eat a couple of bites.  I walked out of the place and threw it in the trash just outside.  

This place is in a touristy area, so they probably get a lot of traffic, probably have to pay very high rent and need to keep their costs low, so they probably buy the cheapest ingredients.  No matter how hungry you are, please don't eat here",1

Was in town in June and stopped in based on the positive reviews. Unfortunately they did not live up to the actual food. 

The wonton noodle soup was bland, the broth was most likely water, and had a couple of noodles and a piece of cabbage. I had higher hopes for the Pad Thai and was met with equal disappointment. The best part about Thai cuisine is the flavor and heat that goes along with it, the Pad Thai missed on both. The chicken was so over cooked it was rubbery and there was no flavor to be had there.",1

I was excited to see the new place, and I tend to be hyper critical, and I have a great eye for a well run comedy club, I have been in many, some well run and some not, so here goes.

My first impression of The Days Hotel complex was Stellar! Squeaky clean, and an amazing combo of Rock and Roll and Southwestern d√©cor. The staff was friendly, kind, and helpful.

It was once I hit the doors of the new SUS that I knew something special was about to happen. Personal greetings from Howard and Lisa for all, not just me. They want you there, they want to entertain you.

What happened was a great line-up of very funny comedians was set and achieved entertaining a full house. The fact that Howard is booking such amazing talent in what is obviously a small room (120?seats) in such an intimate setting makes this place a cant miss.
 
Looking at the calendar there is no letting up, these are the same comedians being booked at the really big clubs in town and across the country. Take advantage of that because sometimes in small rooms magic happens as I think it did with Deitrich Shelton, Paul Johnson Howard and Lynne Koplitz last night. It was one of my very favorite shows ever.

Service was great and Food and beverage options are as good as the 5th Ave location at its best. Come hungry and early because The food looks amazing as did the margaritas.

2835,"tl;dr Inedible. Avoid at all costs. Zero stars.

The only thing authentically Middle Eastern about this place is the fact that their meat approximates the texture and appearance of ancient Egyptian mummies.

I ordered takeout from this establishment. A few simple meat over rice dishes. Chicken kabob, gyro, beef kebab. What they served barely registered as food. The gyro meat was like modeling clay left in the sun, and crunched when I tried to bite it. The beef had progressed past the jerky phase and into some uncharted territory of inedibility. The chicken was translucent and smelly, like...well, like chicken that has gone bad. It defies metaphor. The rice was...present...in its gloppy over-cooked glory. This was served with a plastic cup of ranch dressing and a plastic cup of the saddest little half-rotten, feculent excuse for a cucumber salad.

I called this establishment (I hesitate to call it a restaurant. That title is earned) to complain, and was met with a very unapologetic response. Allow me to directly quote: ""yeah, we were running low on meat today so yours was from much earlier in the day.""

Five stars to Wheel Deliver for getting us a full refund for this inedible insult to human decency.",1

Tonight I went into Dottie's after work just wanted to get literally one beer and gamble a bit. Walked in and just sat down, started to gamble about $20. Waited about 10 minutes and didn't see anyone. I'm a really patient person compared to other people so I just minded my own business and kept gambling. Another 10minutes go by and I see the bartender don't know her name but she's a white lady a bit older also, she's on the other side sitting down taking a smoke break which I definitely understand. So about 40+ minutes have gone by and she still hasn't come to me and I'm already pretty just over staying and losing my money without a drink. I would just go to another Dotty's but this one is super close to my house. I don't know if she was having a bad day or just didn't want to serve me for some odd reason so just got up and approached her to redeem my voucher for my money. Right when she was done with one customer she up and left me at the counter in awe. She just looked at me and said she has something to do and went to the back. Honestly I was so shocked I just laughed. Dotty's please come on do better.",1

His lines are great and somehow still works super fast to save you some pain. I found him online when looking for a specific style and I've been kickin it at his shop ever since.

2845,"I love the Mushroom Pie. It's so savory, the dough is perfect and they bake them perfectly bi also love the cheesecake.",5
2846,"I don't usually like burgers but the Shack Burger is real good. I personally think it's because they took the extra effort to fry the insides of the bun with butter. And the vanilla custard is heavenly, with creamy and smooth texture, not too sweet, not too much of vanilla essence taste. Surprisingly good for a fast food store. A quick meal under $10.",5
2847,Annoyingly large portions but the food has been surprisingly great every time! The atmosphere has a Disney/strip club feel and they have a photographer to take your photo.,5
2849,"I always have a great experience here. They have everything I use and there pricing is decent and usually in line with Costco. 

They have a couple of elderly people who do receipt checks at the exit and sometimes there pretty grumpy. One of them indirectly accused my wife of stealing a child's jacket that was ours.

She kept asking for the receipt for it and we explained to her that we brought the jacket in with us and that its my sons. She then said okay wheres the receipt for it. Again we told her there is no receipt because its ours. Can understand why she thought we had to pay for it. The jacket is in moderate condition. My kids are really hard on clothes and it definitely wouldn't pass for new.

Finally gave up and kept walking.",5
2850,If I could give less than one star I would. This place is filthy dirty. This is my second time there and not even soap in the restrooms. Spilled and dried hard coffee on the coffee tables. Debris on the floor.  Do not go here.,1
2851,Huevos rancheros and chocolate chip pancakes. The best! I order the same thing every time.,5
2852,"Kim was awesome! I've recently moved to the area and my hair needed some TLC. Kim did exactly what I was looking for and she had some awesome tips to keep my hair healthy! The price is great for what you pay and the products made my hair feel much healthier. I got highlights and a cut and some products for just under $200. I ended up getting shampoo & conditioner from the line that they carry, goldwell from Germany. Never heard of the product until now and so far i like it. Smells and feels great! Your first time at Elysium 5 is 10% off on services which is another added bonus. The ladies in the salon are welcoming and helpful. Definitely will recommend this place to others and will be back for my touch-ups etc! :)",5
2853,"I wish I could give this place zero stars. I'm completely appalled at how I was treated. I walked in with my headphones on so I didn't notice when this white woman walked up behind me. Nearly scared me half to death. She was about 5'6"", short haircut like a little boy and wore black pants and a black collared shirt. She follows me around the entire stop. She kept asking me questions about everything I looked at. It was very awkward and uncomfortable when I'm attempting to shop for unmentionables. I'd like to keep that private. And when I asked her to go away and stop following me because it was awkward she got mad and muttered under her breath. It honestly felt like she was racial profiling me. Little did she know I was prepared to drop over $100. When you treat your customers like crap and follow them around they won't come back and they will surely tell the world about your terrible service. If the owner sees this I suggest you fire her or explain good customer service skills because she's lacking.",1
2855,"Such an awesome place.  It's a cool hang out for friends and also great to bring the kids.  Love the ping pong, giant Jenga and corn hole!",5
2856,"Excellent pastries! Their cupcakes are moist, balanced in flavor, & perfectly complemented by the frostings. Not excessively sweet, either, just right. I really like the peanut butter chocolate, & the mango passion fruit cupcakes. Their brownies & scones are also very good. 
I always bring out of town visitors to this pastry shop, & every one of them has loved it. 
Only wish they had a espresso bar in there... That would be awesome!",5
2857,Avoid avoid avoid avoid avoid avoid avoid go to any other CIBC branch stay away from this place OK! Absolutely horrible service they do not want your business you are not a priority for them. Especially if you're a business owner in the area absolutely avoid this bank at all costs go to any other bank any other branch just avoid this one YOU ARE NOT A PRIORITY!!!!! your business is not a priority they don't care they don't care at all. at the end of the day they only care about their hourly wage and their salary. PS AVOID KALINKA? kanika? At all costs!!,1
2858,"Terrific staff with strong, neighborhood atmosphere. We often reserve the room in the back for meetings in the mornings. They have a wide variety of low cost items like bagels, oatmeal, muffins to balance a budget. Great selection of pizzas, sandwiches and salads at lunch.  We also stop by here for dessert and coffee with quiet conversation after having a more formal evening meal. Patio is a great to enjoy the weather when the evening is pleasant.

2864,Gave this spot a shot today for dinner/drinks.  Sat at the half empty bar for over 10 mins & got nothing but occasional blank stares from the 2 girls behind the counter.  We left disappointed and spent our $ elsewhere.,1
2865,"We wanted to go here last night. Since it was a Friday night we called ahead to see how long the wait was. Well, actually we TRIED to call ahead. Multiple time. They kept picking up the phone and just hanging up. We drove out there (while my fianc√©e was calling again to see how long the wait was) and they still kept hanging up on us. When we got there and told the manager what was happening his response was ""Well we're busy."" No apology whatsoever. Guess you're too busy for these customers because we will never be returning.",1
2867,"Fantastic food, great service, wonderful atmosphere and strong signature cocktails. We had the bouillabaisse, duo lamb, tuna tartare, Portuguese creme br√ªl√©e and for drinks ""the derby"". I would encourage everyone to visit Ferreira Cafe for a great dining experience.",5
2869,"Cheap, delicious food and great customer service. Definitely will be ordering from here again. I love it",5
2870,"To be fair, this is a BRUNCH REVIEW ONLY.

I'm a patient person most of the time.  But my oh my, Disgraceland, today you tested me.  Your coffee delivers a mouthful of grains, your dishes are undercooked and overpriced, your service is painfully slow, and in this girl's eyes, there's nothing redeeming about your brunch.  Hipster hangout be damned.

I'll give you a star for having board games on hand, though.",1
2871,"Went here for breakfast and would definitely recommend. Make sure you make reservations. Ordered the blueberry French toast; usually I don't order sweets over my savory for breaks fat but given it was recommended, I tried and was glad I did. I might have to say that it was by far one of the best French Toasts I've ever had! The blueberries were plentiful, the syrup was amazing, and thus the entire combo was amazing. Also ordered the eggs Benedict which was good. Great view of the bellagio fountains and the service was great. Truly a must eat place while in Vegas",5
2875,"Some people don't realize what it is like behind the scenes in the hospital. I see people complaining about the empty ED waiting room and how they still have to wait hours to be seen. You may be sitting there with your broken hand or with an upset stomach or itchy because of an allergen. But what you don't know is that behind doors physicians and nurses are in the middle of saving the lives of people who need priority care... people who will most likely die if not cared for first. 20 physicians and nurses could be working on that 2 year old who stopped breathing after being pulled out from underwater as she fights to live, or they could be caring for that family who were slammed into by a semi while hoping that the parents don't die so their children won't grow up as orphans. Some people may complain about how their physician is stuck up or how their nurse doesn't give them enough attention. Sure those behaviors are not acceptable, but sometimes you need to be empathetic. You are not the only patient the physician has to care for. He/she may have over 50 patients they're responsible for that day. That nurse may be busy resuscitating that critical patient whose condition is tanking fast. It is not easy being responsible for so many people's lives. My point is that Banner University Medical Center is a great hospital with amazing physicians and nurses who work hard to develop their skills and knowledge. The work that these health care providers and staff members do is all in the interest of providing excellent patient centered care. I would highly recommend this hospital to anyone deciding which Banner facility to go to.",5
2877,"I loved this show!!! I grew up in the 80's so i dressed up like Madonna and had Michael Jackson everything.

2880,"I love pure barre! I have been going for about 3 months now and I really have seen a change in my body. I was a little skeptical at first as I am an avid yogi but I have found that pure barre has actually IMPROVED my yoga practice! It really is a challenging work out that is low impact and high intensity with a focus on the core. As another person said earlier, it actually gets harder as you get better because you are doing the movements properly and you learn how to ""tuck"". It is a little pricey but the studio is constantly having specials which makes it totally worth it, look out for them. I would recommend it either to supplement your current exercise routine or just by itself but definitely try it out!",5
2882,"This place is just plain awesome. Good prices,  great service and great food. The portions are huge!!! That homestyle cooking that everyone loves. I wish I lived in Phoenix because this would be a regular stop. If you are in the area this is a must try.",5

They have everything you can think of and more!",5
2897,"This is a pretty uncomfortable review for me to write, because I really enjoy the winking lizard, the kids enjoy going there, and overall it's a really solid and decent place to grab a bite and a beer. However this night did nothing short of infuriate me and I'll tell you why. 

I arrived at the lizard with the kids while my wife is running about 10 minutes behind. Our server was very nice and relatively new by her own admission. I ordered a black and tan which everybody knows is Guinness mixed with another beer and that beer alternates regionally.  The beer came out in an imperial pint glass as Guinness should...but it was 2/3 full.  2/3!  I pointed this out to my relatively inexperienced to server, but she stated oh you have to give it time to settle and it will filll right back up. Now I've been drinking Guinness for quite some time, and it never did quite fill up. I ask the server to go and get the manager so he can correct the pour. The manager on duty did show up and proceeded to tell me that because it was a black and tan, they put it in an imperial glass although they do this so they do not have to wait for the head to settle. Now I am NOT saying the Customer is always right, but you do not serve a beer in a glass two thirds full.  And then proceeded to argue with a customer in front of his kids by telling him he is wrong and the restaurant is right and they're not going to change it.  

Naturally, this infuriated me and I asked the server to give me my bill as we're going to get out.  At this time the wife showed up and calmed me down...but now I can't enjoy a meal with an ahole know it  all ""manager"" who's only response to a complaint should have been ""I'll fix that right away sir"".

Piss off lizard.  There's plenty of other choices of places to eat in mentor.",1
2898,"This Korean chicken store is awesome!! I am Korean, and I think their chicken is the best one I have ever had! The chicken is very crispy and tender. I heard that they use vegetable oil not shortening, and also the chicken is made with fresh chicken. I am so impressed with their food.:)",5
2899,"We ordered pizza from La Grotta for the first time this past weekend. We were so impressed!
We got 2 smalls so we can sample more than one flavour: 1) sausage with olives and 2) roasted red peppers and feta. 
The crust was thin and the toppings were delicious. Not greasy in any way. (well the sausage abit).
My kids do not like chain pizza or frozen pizza but before I noticed they had eaten up half of what was on their plate!

Will always order pizza from them now on - support local!
I'll try a pasta next time too.",5
2900,"Hands down the best Indian cuisine in Las Vegas. I have done a few taste tests within the city but nothing has come close to my dining experience at Mt. Everest. It is not only the food that keeps me coming back but the service as well. It is a family run restaurant and every member is always hospitable, welcoming and attentive. I cannot recommend this restaurant enough.",5
2902,"I've been eating in so many middle Eastern cuisine's but this one so far is the worst I have been , the service is terrible it's not even logical to wait so much time to get your food ready like seriously? The food was on the lower level but not what I expected at all . Stay away from the shawarma it's horrible !!!!!",1
2904,"We never had a problem until they overcharged us and didn't give us a receipt. Based on the menu prices, we calculated (by adding tax etc) and it just didn't add up whatsover. We asked them again how much the shisha was and then they told us a different price from what was on the menu, which, if calculated with tax, still didn't add up. Simply a dishonest and quite sketchy way to run a business.",1
2906,"Went there last weekend with a friend for dinner. Got the fresh spring rolls and the Cambodian specialty of fried rice cakes under a pork mixture (sorry forget the name). Had to get pad Thai and Penang for entrees. Everything was great; fresh, hot, well seasoned, good quality. Cannot wait to go back.",5

He called Desert Locksmith and was quoted a 20 minute timeframe to arrive. The owner, Ran, arrived in only 10 minutes! He was very friendly, efficient, professional, and easy to work with. He had the lock replaced in a matter of minutes, and acted like it was no trouble at all. He saved the day and we are very grateful! I believe this company offers 24-hour service calls, so I highly recommend them the next time you need help and need it fast!",5

They'll tell you to test out your drink. If you don't like it, they'll fix it :D",5
2924,"The food is great! But the service is pretty bad. Me, my daughter, and my friend came in today sat there for 10 minutes without any help. I had to get up to get a menu and they still didn't acknowledge us. Finally I had enough and went up the waiter and asked if we were ever getting help because they sure ran up to the elderly couple that just came in. When she came up to take our food order she gave horrible attitude and rushed us. So I don't know if it's because we are women of color? I really hope that's not the case because then I will have a more formal complaint on the way. It needs to get addressed because that's extremely poor customer service.",1
2926,"I went to lunch with a coworker, after I just got off of work. She was going back, but we had an hour of downtime. We ordered our drinks, and received those quickly. Our Lady waitress asked if we needed more time, and we said yes, as it was our first time at Keegan's. Ten minutes later, a waiter walked up and said he would be serving our table instead. I asked for a refill then and we ordered our appetizer. We didn't see our waiter again until he brought out our appetizer. Still no refill. I had finished the appetizer, and we were waiting to order. I flagged our waiter down, and asked for a refill again. This time he went right to refill the drink. Once he returned we were able to order. I asked for no onions on my burger, with extra pickles. To my dismay, I received a burger with two pickle slices and plenty of onions. At this point we were a bit rushed with eating, because my co-worker's lunch hour was nearly up. I pulled the onions off and  didn't ask for more pickles. One drink, a pretzel burger and half appetizer totalled to $22.00. The fries were delicious, but the spinach artichoke dip came with broccoli and carrots, which didn't make sense to me. Plate fillers- I think. I also came with salsa, which was terrible. The pretzel burger was tainted by the onions, so it could have been better if done right. Overall experience felt cheap, when the bill was quite pricey. I would not recommend.",1
2927,The tacos AL Pastor  and de carnitas are awesome.  The enchiladas are good too. Their green salsa is tasty.  I liked the Horchata because it wasn't super sweet.  We will be back.,5
2929,"The MOST amazing fried chicken on earth!  Puts KFC to shame!

Just sooooo good!  Cooked in small batches, so it's always hot and fresh!

And the biscuits with butter and honey.... Awesome!

The Mac and cheese is soooo good too.... I'm home now, and I just realized that I forgot to buy some to take home......

Apple pie is also quite good! Lots of cinnamon!

You must try!

And this location is now huge, double in size... They took over the subway that was beside them!  Excellent!

And specials every day!  Staff are always friendly and helpful!",5

2937,"Decided on Angolino to host my fathers 65th birthday dinner, with family & friends.
I live in the area & read the reviews on all the social media outlets, Google & Yelp since they opened. They were all positive & rightfully so.

The food was amazing. Having lived & worked in Woodbridge for 10 years, Italian food & culture became a big part of my life (I'm of German/Irish/Canadian heritage) & it takes a lot to impress me when it comes to Italian food. My wife is a big foodie & a regular to fine dining. After the meal we both agreed that was really something special. Everyone in our party was impressed with the meal, including the most important person of the day, my father. 

The service was wonderful. Rozi & Tyson really know how to make you feel welcome &  made the experience a wonderful one, for my fathers birthday. Thank you to you both & all the staff at Angolino for making my fathers 65th such a wonderful experience. We will definitely be returning again. 

I think when Joe C says he eats out a lot, I believe him. But maybe he should stick to the fast food, clearly his 1 review of 1 star conveniently, either makes him a little jelous of Angolinos success, or he has the pallet of a child & isn't ready for fine dining. Either way, my wife & I have been to Angolino on several occasions now, and dinner was always fantastic!!

Posted pictures of the Beef Short Rib, Angolotti, & Tyson & Rozi were nice enough to join me & my father & my girlfriend for a photo (my mom was busy enjoying herself with our guest) also posted.",5
2938,"My 5 sisters and I shared three rooms here and had the worst experience. The hotel is remodeling and there was plastic sheeting everywhere, very reminiscent of The Shining. The carpets were filthy and black water ran off our feet when we showered. The shower in one of the rooms leaked into the room below and my sisters were told not to take any more shower until maintenance could take a look. This was in the morning when we were trying to make it to a 9:00 event and only one sister had showered. So she had to shower in my room, making us run late and miss our event! We got in late that night and found that my room hadn't even been cleaned. The night clerk brought us clean towels but stated that he couldn't help us with our request for a free night because of all the trouble. The next morning we were told that they could not give us a free night or even a discount because we had booked through Expedia. This was not true, we booked through hotels.com and paid the hotel directly when we got there. That morning my sisters were locked out of their room for about 1/2 an hour while maintenance tried to get the door open. They finally did but this delayed my sisters from leaving on their 12-hour car ride home. 

I am COMPLETELY DISGUSTED that our stay was so bungled and they would not do anything to make it right! Stay at your own risk because they sure as heck don't care about having return customers.",1
2939,"wow, worst Starbucks I've encountered. (and tbh, I've never really encountered a bad one let alone a terrible one).

Apparently this is a Starbucks but not actually a Starbucks so rewards and refllls don't follow regular procedure, nor is there any free wifi. 

But what was the worst about that was that they were rude about it (especially two of the tellers). And when the manager explained that all Starbucks do not give multiple refills, he directed me to the website, but since there's no free wifi, he said he could print it out for me. Said he would be back in 10 minutes, 25 minutes later, still never returned and the staff had no idea where he had disappeared to or if he was coming back. 

The website by the way says this ""Free refill(s) of hot or iced brewed coffee and tea. You must use your registered Starbucks Card to purchase a beverage and then present that same Starbucks Card for refills of hot or iced brewed coffee or tea during the same store visit at participating Starbucks stores."" http://www.starbucks.ca/card/rewards/rewards-program-ts-and-cs
Please note the (s) in refill(s). Would that not indicate multiple? Never had a problem at any other location as long as it's same store visit as indicated. (Manager here also said it was within a certain time frame only and required a receipt). 

Only the shorter girl with black hair in a pony tail had any proper customer service etiquette.",1

First, I spoke to a man on the phone and was told the car I wanted was there and for a good price, drove all the way down there, and got the excuse ""there must have been something wrong with my internet"" since the car I was told an hour before was there, was now not there and there was nothing they could do. Actually, they didn't even try to do anything to help, except recommend I actually go to another dealer! To top it off, I'm trying to get the situation resolved, the man had absolutely no interest or consideration for the deal or car he said he had, the manager didn't come to even introduce himself even after getting ready to leave twice. If you want to buy a Hyundai, go to ANY other dealership and save yourself the time... I wish I had seen a post like this before giving them the time of day...",1

2947,"Second time to this restaurant, had a rocky dine in first time, completely messed up the order, place had just opened so we thought we would give it another go BAD IDEA. Second try was a take out order, completely messed up the order, food cold and cheese in ENCHILADA STACK not melted, how do not melt Velveeta? I called to let them know the order was incorrect, just wants my credit card refunded, but GM stated ""just give my name next time your in and Ill make it right for you""- not coming back wanted my 16 dollars for 2 burritos incorrectly made- not earth shattering just good customer service after messing up. I have 30 years in the restaurant industry and taking care of your customer is paramount.
About 9 hours after eating here- projectile vomiting- loss day of work the next day.
Lets just say I will not be returning. I wish them all the luck with this track record they will need it.

2950,"My husband's family has been getting their keilbasa & smokies from Czuchraj for over 50 years.  He's been raving about it for years and I have to admit that the keilbasa that I've tried at their home was amazing.  The last time we visited Pittsburgh we made the special trip to Cleveland just to visit them and load up the car for 3 households.  AMAZING!  The beef jerky was awesome, but my favorite is the smoked goose liverwurst - on a piece of toasted bread (from the bakery that's in the corner of the market) *drool*",5

2955,"We live up the street from Chagrin Falls and we're in the village about 2-3 times a week, but somehow we never made it to FlipSide, until the other day. I never order burgers in restaurants, but during our visit, it felt wrong not to try the burgers. I went with the FlipSide Burger to truly get the real experience. My daughter ordered a plain cheeseburger and my husband had the Mikey burger.

This was the greatest cheeseburger I've ever eaten in my life. 

It was juicy, the flavors of the onions with the burger and the cheese and bacon were just phenomenal. It was such a joy to eat. I can't even put it into words that can do it justice. I was reeling from how delicious this was -- and while I'm no burger connoisseur, I would take a FlipSide burger over any other burger in town, including B Spot. (Sorry, Michael Symon!)

Beyond the amazing burgers, the milkshakes were awesome and the mini corndogs were tasty (we ate a lot of food). 

Lastly, the service was impeccable. We showed up on a busy lunch hour and we were surprised to get a table immediately. Our waitress, who was also the person who sat us, was incredibly accommodating even when we brought a newborn baby and a four-year-old with us. She was extremely friendly and super fast. The whole experience was fantastic all around.",5
2956,"I have been going to Jennifer as long as I've been in grad school (~4 yrs, depending on what kind of mood I'm in when you ask me). Jennifer has always been a consummate professional and (perhaps more importantly) a fantastic stylist. She always listens to what I have to say and will tell me what works for my hair type and face shape. She is meticulous and takes pride in her work and will not stop cutting until the style is right! If you go home and have difficulties styling or the hair isn't laying quite right she will cut it again (within 1 wk) or offer styling tips for those of us who tend to be hair-challenged. I always receive compliments from people I meet at stores or while running errands after I get a hair cut. Whenever I would like to update my style or if I just need some hair maintenance Jennifer is always great to work with (and fun!). Finally, I have been hesitant about purchasing hair styling products in the past, but I am always confident that Jennifer chooses the products she sells carefully, and goes out of her way to find things that are suitable for her client's individual hair needs. 

Jennifer's new salon is very cozy and whenever I go there I receive individual attention. Visiting is like going over to your best girl friend's house and it is very relaxing. I never feel rushed and I always leave Innu feeling refreshed and confident. 

I highly recommend Jennifer and Innu Hair Salon.",5
2958,Becky was so sweet. She had excellent customer service. I made a last minute reservation online but they were able to accommodate me. I even got an upgrade. I was in and out in 15 mins for both check out and return. Huge difference from the other location (Sahara). I will be using this location from now on.,5
2959,"We absolutely love this little hole in the wall taco shop. I've tried the carnitas, al pastor, chicken, and carne asada; the carne in my opinion is by far the best. Its got such a great flavor and the perfect crunchiness. 

The also supply you with plenty of limes, cucumbers, spicy carrots and onion garnish, as well as three different sauces you can add (green, red, and a customizable hot sauce; I.e. the more you stir it up the hotter it is). I definitely suggest adding them all, even the carrots and onions go great on or with the tacos. The tortillas are incredible as well, they're fried just right and super fresh. 

Now for the cons, the neighborhood is a little sketchy and parking can be difficult since theres only one row of parking between the businesses and 32nd St. Its definitely not fancy in any way, but the food is fresh and done well.",5
2960,Great ramen place!!! I recommend !,5
2961,"Crooks. Bunch of CROOKS.

1) You order a dish, but they don't even tell you that things like 'sweet potato fries' are an extra, and not part of a no-charge menu item

2) Drinks at the bar are charged at $3.50 for instance, but if you order at the table, it's only $3. WTF? 

I hate this place. I understand the appeal of the big screens, but it was not worth my money.

The food was also not that awesome. Sliders looked dry, the tacos were disgusting and they charged extra for everything without telling you that the pork was $3 extra, and so on..

I mean, if you are going to lie about the items, I COULD pay $3 for pork, but not if you sneak it in there without telling me it's an extra charge.

I also took the brisket sandwich and it was DRY AS HELL. Disgusting.

EFFING CROOKS. NEVER going back. This re-affirms my hate for sports bars.",1
2964,"Great burger! The queso burger was excellent and my wife claims that these are the BEST garlic fries she's ever had. I'm not a garlic fry expert but that is pretty high praise from her. The regular fries with ranch were very good. 

I do have to say that my son did not enjoy his grilled cheese from the kids menu. It was obviously a processed cheese. I ate some, it was actually pretty good, I think the kid is just spoiled since we normally cook with some high grade cheeses. Kids!

The environment is very nice, clean with good service. The restrooms were clean. 

All in all a very nice lunch. Thumbs up!",5
2965,"Gibbys is now closed, it opened up under new ownership on august 19th and is now know as The Hangar.",1
2966,"The attention to detail on all fronts is exceptional... Excellent service, food, coffee, cleanliness, ambiance, and overall experience. The first restaurant that inspired me to write a review in years!",5
2967,"This is my first Thai restaurant in Toronto but I think it's setting the bar really high for others to beat.

The Khao Soi is a yellow egg noodle in a creamy curry broth. It's very flavorful, rich in coconut and hot curry. It's well balanced. The coconut didn't over power the curry flavor. It had a small teaspoonful of hot red chili oil on top. Make sure you mix it well with the noodle and broth. It gives it the right amount of kick to the flavor. It's perfection.

The Sukho Thai Pad Thai is very authentic. It has a sweet base flavor from the tamarind sauce. It's not sour like the common ""Ketchup-ish"" Pad Thai you'd get elsewhere. Sprinkle the roasted peanut on top to round out all the flavor. Don't skip it unless you're allergic to peanut. We ordered chicken with it and we get generous amount of chunky tender chicken. The chicken is slightly just a tad less juicy than I'd like but it's by far the best chicken Pad Thai in GTA.

Oh the green curry! Creamy oh so creamy coconutty green curry! Need I say more? Surprisingly the coconut, bamboo shoot, bell pepper, and curry flavor are all well balanced. Individual flavor comes out progressively in my mouth and also burst out happily together.  Love it! If I have a XXL stomach, I'd have tried out all the curry.

I round out tonight with the Thai ice tea and cassava cake.

In my humble opinion, the chef put a lot of thought into the menu. The choir on the menu is limited but each dish is prepared and crafted with love and sincerity.

If I were to nitpick a little bit, they could improve a little bit at seating people and handling the line of people waiting for table. All the people picking up take-out, paying for take-out, waiting for table and paying for the dinner are all on the same line. This makes for quite a hectic dining experience for an otherwise perfecto dinner.",5
2969,WOW! Ordered a Veggie Bean Tofu Wrap this evening. I found a dead COCKROACH in the wrap! Luckily I was looking at the wrap between bites and didn't eat the roach. The restaurant offered to replace it but would you eat one after that?,1
2972,"I had to actually put my food down to write a review of this incredible place. I thought I had exhausted the selection of non-pizza takeout in the brentwood area when yelp brought this lovely little gem to my attention. set in a nondescript strip mall on route 51 just south of its intersection with Brownsville road, this place is easy to miss. (pause for a snack...okay let's do this.) The service was great. the people working there were so sweet and my food was on time.

For my entree I ordered the Tika Masala chicken. On the yelp ordering tool, there are 4 spicy levels: mild, medium, spicy and very spicy. I chose very spicy and put a note to make it as spicy as it gets because I can handle it. When they handed me my food it was accompanied by a small ramekin of red sauce. The gentleman told me this was for extra spice if I wanted, but that I should be careful because it's really spicy. the woman working the register agreed. ""it's hot"" she said. To be honest, at first I was skeptical of this. I have been handed many a ramekin of mystery red sauce at many a restaurant and told many a time that it was the spicy sauce to end all spicy sauces. I've been let down before. But folks, I say this to all my spicy food addicted friends: this is it. As soon as I got home I opened the ramekin of forbidden sauce and dipped my finger in it to try it because I'm a badass. it tasted like hot pepper extract. there is *no salt* in here. it's just the essence of the fires of hell distilled into perfection. Also, my food was pretty darn spicy to begin with. 

So it's obvious I'm a spicy food fanatic and this place hit the spot, but the quality of the food was also great. the Tika Masala was delicious and tasted homemade. It wasnt just spicy and nothing else, it had a great depth of flavor and noticeable notes of various spices that I embarrasingly can't identify. I could tell the chicken was fresh. The dish came with rice, but I ordered a side of Naan too. They obviously make this in-house as well. It was really good.

I also ordered a starter of the steamed vegetable mo mo and I love that as well. These are delicious plane or with the interesting spicy sauce they come with. I have been snacking on them while I write this review. You get 10 of them for 7.99, which brings me to my last thing:

Everest is really reasonably priced. I got all my food including my extra side of naan for under $20. Most entrees are about $10. I will definitely be back. get yourself there, you won't regret it!",5
2975,"We like to try local eateries. We often avoid chains to support our small business owners. The food here seems interesting, but falls short. Every thing was bland and lacking a wow factor. A kicker for us was a server dropped several plates and glasses. Accidents happen, but when the glass shatters into my 6 yr old girls' hair, shoes and lap, I expect a sincere apology. Not oops...a sweep up...never to be heard from again. Food...mediocre...service...huge fail. Never even asked if she was ok. Other guests were more concerned. We won't come back.",1
2976,"From the moment you walk in you know you are in for a dining experience. The ambiance is upscale chop house the feeling is family,the staff are extremely friendly. The menu is great offering wet aged beef as well as a good lineup of seafood. The sides are family style and delicious. I had the 22oz porterhouse it was so tender I could almost cut it with a fork. There are sauce toppings available for the steaks but why bother with perfection. Marcie our server was informative of the menu, friendly with excellent recommendations. The rest of the staff were also very attentive and efficient and most friendly. I felt I was being served by friends I've known a long time. My highest recommendations for Arrowhead Grill.",5
2978,Was not impressed with the pizza.the Dell was raw very undercooked it was just an OK sauce nothing to rave about.. I come from a long line of pizza makers and i know good pizza when I taste it.. this wasn't close to being good very disappointed,1
2979,"The male performers were beyond excellent. Sadly, the staff was NOT. The female employees were downright rude, obnoxious, and unprofessional!! Their discourteous, disrespectful behavior was bewilderingly shocking, especially considering the fact that we were a party of 16 women who had each paid $75++ to be there. I would recommend firing the female staff or taking your bridal parties elsewhere. It was a shockingly rude, hostile, disappointing experience, and frankly, an utter waste of money given the despicable manner in which we were treated by female staff. The male performers, in contrast, were beyond fabulous and I would give them 10 stars were it not for the abhorrent manner in which we were treated by the female staff.",1
2980,"This place does not even deserve to be in business.  Their employee Dillon kicked out a family because their little girl, who has autism was standing on the booth in her socks singing.   Extremely rude and discriminatory......skip it and go somewhere that does not discriminate.  If I could give LESS than 1 star I would.",1
2981,"Originally tried this studio out based on a trial offer for new students. Fell so in love with the instructors and the facility that I signed up for a membership before my trial period was even halfway over! BYAZ provides a great schedule consisting of a variety of classes, including hot yoga, HIIT, and pilates. The instructors are so welcoming and truly get to know everyone who visits the studio, no matter if they are a first timer or a 10 year-er. The locker rooms are extremely well-kept and they provide amenities for all of your post-practice needs (plastic bags, q-tips, lockers w/ locks, etc.) Highly recommend BYAZ (The Foundry AZ) for anyone looking to enhance their practice and truly gain a family of yogi's.",5
2982,I've been blessed to date chefs that's travel the world and also I live in VEGAS so I am blessed to eat food at some restaurants with the best chefs in the world .... Let me tell you this .... BEST WEDGE SALAD of my life and BEST CRAB CAKES EVER!!!!!  Sat at bar to watch cooks do their thing and Ken himself came and sat with us!!!! AMAZING!,5
2983,"I love Korean food so I try to go to a new place often. Now let me tell you that THIS IS MY FAVOURITE PLACE SO FAR!
we got the spicy red sauce with cheese in size large (white). A group of 3 people shared that and we had leftovers. It was the only thing we ordered.
It came with the best glass noodles I ever had, they were THICK! Which I found unusual but great. There was also more cheese served than other places. It was my first time finding potato  slices, dumplings, and cheese filled dokkbolki. The boneless chicken also made it easy to eat. My friend commented that a bowl of rice would go well with this dish to soak up extra sauce. In the future, I would order extra glass noodles and extra rice cakes!!! The spice level was also perfect. Not too spicy but just right!
Would highly recommend!!",5
2984,I had the #5 Lunch Special Pad Thai spicy level 3 (hot enough to burn my tongue but not to hot that I couldn't enjoy it). So delicious! I also had an Iced Thai Coffee that was good. Great prices & service.,5
2986,"Loved the food and the ambiance of this restaurant. From the outside it doesn't look like much, but the inside was really cozy and, although casual, the decor was appropriate for a nice sit down dinner. I base my ratings for Vietnamese cuisine according to their grilled chicken and rice or vermicelli. So I ordered the grilled chicken with rice and added an egg with an additional charge. My friend got the Pad Thai. The service was a bit slow and the food took a bit longer than other Viet restaurants I've been to, but considering the fully occupied restaurant, I understood. The server was friendly, nevertheless.
The portion sizes were good and the chicken was excellent...not too greasy (as I've experienced in the past). My dish was also served with a side of pho broth, which according to the server, was to be eaten with the rice. This was something that has never been served at other restaurants that I have been to. Although I still do prefer the flavour of the lemongrass grilled chicken from Pho mi 99 at Latimer, this chicken had a different seasoning which was good too for a change. 
The Pad Thai was also really enjoyed. By the time we were done with dinner the waiting line for a table had significantly increased, which goes to show it's popularity. I really enjoyed this place and will definitely return.",5
2989,"Visited from LA, and this place did not disappoint! Huge servings, wide choices, yummy food, warm staff. Yes it's located in a food court, but the food is sit-down restaurant quality. The chef/owner even checked on while we were eating. Would recommend this place!",5
2990,Used this company and the gentleman was quick and fast.  He was able to help with all my questions and recommend repairs.  Thanks,5
2992,"This place is a family owned adorable flash back to the 60s. The guy who helped us out (Chad) was the original 2 hippies' son. I was a bit reticent about the feta on the fish tacos, but they were phenomenal. The fresh Pico de Gallo and cabbage add a nice texture and lightness to the fried fish. The fish was crisp and fresh tasting (not fishy tasting). The tacos come with a side of fries that were lightly dusted with some sort of salty Chile pepper. Fries were similarly freshly prepared. Chad also let us bring in our dog on a 115 degree day. He was incredibly accommodating and jolly. My partner got the baby blue burger. The burger had tasty mushroom, crispy bacon, and the Patty was cooked just right. Overall a must stop in Phoenix Arizona!",5
2993,Excellent food. I had the crab & citrus salad. My plate could of been bigger. The portion was perfect but the lettuce leaves were huge and i could barely cut it without it falling all over the table. Coffee was great. I would definitely go back and try more items.,5
2994,"The coffee is by far better than The Common and Brockton Haunt. Plus they have amazing breakfast sandwiches, 3-cheese paninis and lunch croissant sandwiches with prosciutto and other deliciousness inside. After 7pm Tuesday through Saturday they serve awesome beer, great cocktails, and delicious bourbon/whiskey. Last but not least, the staff are excellent and very good at what they do.",5
2996,"""The cannoli Tasted like Satan came in my mouth and it was amazing !! "" food was soooo good better than firehouse , Capriotti's ! Definitely recommend this place !!",5
2998,5 out of 5 star hands down. You definitely want to give your business to this smoke shop owner. Him and his son are just absolutely amazing. Great customer service. I look forward to the days where I get to go to Smoke and Vape! Lots of variety and popular products! One stop shop!,5
2999,"Tomorrow I'll be going to SW Medical again, just to have my new cane cut down to size.  I have been so happy with this business, which I have patronized since I first began needing mobility assistance 10 years ago following a hip replacement.  The service is outstanding & the products are of high quality & fairly priced.  (The best part for me?  I live less than a mile away - LOL)  I would happily recommend SW Medical to family & friends with confidence.  One added benefit is the opportunity to support a local community enterprise!",5
3000,"Worst hotel experience of my life. We had to sign a waiver, saying we wouldn't complain about noise. The hotel booked 100s of teenagers from Ontario on a booze and drugs binge fest. The hotel reeked of weed the whole time, slow, broken, spat upon elevators. No effort to herd the children when their suitcases took up the entire lobby floor. Noise at all hours of the night.

Oh, and my door was left open all day by cleaning staff!!! Several attempts to procure real plates and cutlery for my room left unanswered. Finally ended up with plastic and paper -- and a cold dinner. 

Stay clear.",1

3006,"Maddie did a fantastic job grooming our Aussie. I thought shaving him would help with shedding, but she took the time to explain other options (sensing my hesitation) and cut his hair short and sweet. It's our first time grooming and we'll certainly be back to see her. Max looks super good!",5
3008,I have never done yoga before but consider myself relatively fit (for 50!) Izzy was a great instructor and let us all move at our own pace. I was surprised at what I could accomplish with her guidance. Most importantly I felt amazing the rest of the day and can't wait for my next session. Great studio and great team!,5
3010,"Came in after church and got lucky to get a bar seat. The restaurant was very busy, but the service was still great. I got a latte and the quiche of the day. Fabulous! My only complaint was that they were out of fresh squeezed juice, but the quiche was so good it made up for it!!!",5
3011,"When I found this place, I immediately assumed it was going to be too expensive - it's so neat, hip and clean - had to be out of reach, right?  But no - they are hip, neat, clean, plus you get NICE PEOPLE, great selection of products for your four legged furries, and REASONABLY PRICED items too.   They are also incredibly knowledgable about pet food - please don't tell me you are still buying IAMS at the grocery store - ask them why you shouldn't.    Your pets deserve good healthy quality food, and this is definitely the place to get it.   Even better, sometimes there are rescue pets available for adoption.   It's nice to buy your pet's food from a place that loves pets and cares about the animal welfare community.   Go!  Now!",5
3013,This place is amazing. They take the time to work with you on the design that suits you best. Zach is an awesome graphic designer. I was very pleased with this store. I will definitely be coming back for more t shirts!,5
3015,"Dan is awesome and extremely knowledgeable about anything plumbing related.  We actually had drain issues with our sewer (on the driveway) and Dan came out, used a camera to inspect it, and gave us such helpful information about what needs to be done next.   His price is extremely reasonable, and very helpful for those on a tight budget.   He is professional, polite, friendly, and again, very knowledgeable about what he does.  I highly recommend 1st Choice Plumbing for anyone who needs a reputable, trustworthy company!",5
3018,"While visiting the Strip District a few weeks ago, I stopped in for lunch at Gaucho on a whim. It turned out to be the best decision I made that day. It's a small place (it can hold 10-12 people max), and it's easy to miss if you're walking by.

The first thing you notice when you walk in is the aroma from the grill; your mouth is already watering before you sit down. I ordered the carne sandwich with ribeye, which comes topped with grilled peppers & onions and chimmichurri sauce. The meat was well seasoned and cooked perfectly - juicy and tender, with a really nice char. I washed it down with a cold Mexican Coke. It's not the cheapest sandwich you'll find, ringing in at $12, but it's more than worth it. I came in hungry and left full.

Besides the food itself, what really made my visit great was the excellent service. The owner of the place was super friendly and very patient, explaining the various items on the menu. They also did all the little things that take customer service from just good to exceptional. For example, one customer walked in and placed a $150 order to go. Gaucho gives a 10% discount if you call ahead with your takeout order (pro tip), but they went ahead gave him the discount anyway and helped him walk his  order out to his car in the snowy conditions. That is how you do customer service.",5
3019,"This place is cool and different. Everything is situated inside freight containers, stores and restaurants.  I like the fact they recycled materials to make something new.",5
3022,"Always a favorite for us! We recently ordered our wedding cake and they were SO helpful with ideas and suggestions! We were looking for something simple yet elegant and fun and Freed's delivered beautifully as usual! The cake was topped with beautiful fresh and bright gerber daisies and the cake itself was perfectly sweet, light, and moist! We can wait to order a smaller one next year to celebrate our 1st anniversary!",5
3023,"I have been consistenly buying in bulk their carrier and essential oils, butters, and waxes. And as other reviewers have mentioned, their labels are misleading and there are no clear expiration dates for products that have a lot number and the ones that don't. How do they keep an inventory of their old and new products if some don't even have a lot number? We were told some of the oils I purchased have a shelf life of 2 years and when I reached out to another rep they said it will expire in less than 6 months! We were also told they cannot provide expiration dates because their suppliers don't provide this information...We even reached out to the management and they never followed up like they promised. Went by the name Karen. Way too much digging and still more confusion and frustration. 

If you are a skincare and cosmetic company looking to find a good hassel-free vendor, this company should not be on your list unless you want to work with something you don't even know when it will go bad/rancid for your customers.",1
3024,"We recently had to take our family SUV in for some work. We came across APR and could not have been more happy! So its not about the good work, yet the integrity that blew me away. They replaced shocks and struts. As we were driving we found a new sound and had to bring the truck back. Mike at APR offered us his personal vehicle as he knew we have to have transportation with the kids. They found the sound, fixed it for free and tossed in a complimentary oil change for our time. 

Tell me where that happens? We highly recommend the team over at APR in Gilbert. Call and ask for Mike! They are off of Guadalupe and McQueen.

3025,Off the chart great breakfast place. Meat lovers omelet was superb and cooked just right. The ciabatta toast was awesome and toasted perfectly. The potatoes were honestly the best breakfast potatoes I've had in the city .I loved the spices and texture of them. Coffee was really good as well. Everyone working there was very attentive and super friendly. Would definitely go back again. The specials listed all sounded great. Will go back to try the place for lunch somerime.,5
3027,First time here & extremely friendly. First timers get a 30% off their tab.  Very polite and professional. My nails turned out great,5
3028,Tip: would definitely recommend getting tickets online prior to going. They tend to sell out on the weekends and it's worth going online and buying and ensuring a seat than making the trip there and dealing with the line.,5
3029,"It has been quite some time since I have written a one star review, but I was so inclined on this particular occasion that I ended up using Google street view to find and add this business to Yelp. 

I'll keep it short and sweet, as almost everyone knows what Subway is about. We arrived at this location quite starved but were really put off by the state of affairs. First of all, our first 3 choices of subs were simply not available. Once we settled for cold cuts, we were told that we didn't really have much choice as far as the bread or toppings either. I always find it a funny business model to run a restaurant with half the menu items missing. What really got ticked off was how we saw a chicken breast sandwich made without the chicken being warmed up. It's true that the meat is cooked, but there's no way that's safe. There were other unorthodox tidbits but I think this will suffice. 

Overall, walk a little further north to the 24hr McD right up the street. It will seem like fine cuisine in comparison.",1
3031,"Our first time to Itsy Bitsy and it was a fabulous experience! 
Ambiance was equally as hip and appealing as their other properties (Park and Commonwealth) 

Greeted by a friendly hostess followed by great service by our server Alexa. 
Alexa was extremely knowledgable of all specialty drinks/beers and immediately recommended sake bombs which was a great time! 

We ordered the potstickers, garlic chile edamame, skewers and corn for appetizers and tonkatsu ramen for our entree. 
The cookies and cream mochi was the perfect way to end our dinner! 


Great atmosphere, staff and food! 
We will be back soon :)",5

So we pick a color and when i sit back down she said she was going home. So we go to pink box to get donuts with are 1year old and come back this lady is now doing someones feet. She looks at me and said. ""Oh you come back"". long story short she said some shit and now they dont have time to do my nails.

Jaimie Cogburn and his entire staff were professional, courteous, and very knowledgeable about the short-sale process. Not only did Cogburn answer all of our questions in a timely manner, but they went above and beyond to explain each step of the process in a way that was easy to understand. 
 
Not only were they knowledgeable but Cogburn's customer service was great! We were regularly updated of what was going on and never pushed aside for other ""more important"" clients or cases. We felt that Cogburn always made it a priority to keep us involved and informed throughout the process and ensure the transaction was completed in a timely manner.",5

I really craved Vietnamese, and didn't want to go to my usual spot because I didn't want to drive all that way... When lo and behold... The Submarine...  All I read on the signage was Vietnamese Pho, and Vermicelli...WINNER!!!  Didn't know what to expect, and it blew me away.  This is my first review, but I had to write one because its so lovingly made, by a Mom and Pop shop.  I ordered quite a bit of food and bubble tea, and everything was so Fresh and seriously well done.  Now, it did take a while for my large order, but the owner did say it would take longer.  I have to say well worth the wait, AND she gave me a hug after she packaged my meal... Oh, the SUBS are Perfect, with a hint of spice, caramelized onions, savoury cilantro.  The Bun Vermecelli was excellent as I ordered 1 of each meat for my Family to try and they all were super tasty!  Such a great find, and so close to my home...WOW!!!",5

Everything was very good. We didn't leave a bite. For lunch we had the family style serving. We had lasagna, salmon, chicken parmigiana, and vodka pasta. The salmon was very good along with the lasagna. The chicken parmigiana was also very good. Chicken was fried smothered in cheese. Even though everyone was satisfied with the meal our waiter talked us into dessert. We had a tray of canolli's, molten chocolate cake, gelato, and other desserts. Great lunch experience.",5

3053,"I am writing this review just a few minutes after checking in. Upon check in we were informed that that we needed a credit card which I understood. What I found strange was that not only  did they need to charge your card for the room even if you were planning on paying cash but they also needed to charge the card for an additional $200. When I explained that this seemed unusual to me Jit Tanna the General Manager implied that I wasn't used to staying in hotels as nice as his. He went on to say that the rooms are worth $100,000. And they needed to secure the room. I explained to him that I understood the need to secure the, but usually having a credit card on file would suffice. He said this was the policy everywhere. I also told him that when I made the reservation nowhere did it say that there would be a $200 hold on the card. To this he replied that they didn't have to inform you of the $200 hold at the time you make a reservation. My response was its not ok for a business to be deceitful and to have hidden fees or charges. Jit Tanna insisted that it wasn't hidden, I said how could it not be hidden when you just admitted that you don't have to tell you about needing to charge a $200 security deposit up front. This conversation took place at 2:30 am so we wound up paying so we wouldn't be trying  to find a room at such a late hour. As we got off of the elevator we saw bare walls. Bare like no paint or wallpaper. There were joint compound patches all over. I don't think you can claim something is worth$100,000 if it isn't complete.  And as for the $100,000 room, it left a lot to desired: like square footage! I will never stay here again and I would suggest that you wouldn't either!!!!!",1
3054,We've been using Mike for a little under a year now.  My dogs love him.  They are very difficult Salukis.  Both are aggressive with other dogs and a very dominant breed.  He has made them less aggressive with other animals which I never knew was possible.  So not only does he walk them he also trains them.  Both me and my wife have noticed a huge behavioural difference in the younger of the two dogs.  Being hunting dogs Salukis require a lot of exercise.  Sometimes he will come back and they will both be very tired for the rest of the day.  when we ask what he did with them he informs us he went for a jog with both of them.  Love Mikes service and will continue to use him for as long as he's willing to walk our two babies.,5
3057,"I recently moved to Az from Ca. I was happy to learn that there was Cosmo prof here because I loved shopping there at the local store in San Bernardino Ca. I have visited the Indian school location about a half dozen times since ive been here, ive been here for 9 months now, and everytime I went was to purchase clipper blades, I thought whats going on and how often should i have to replace them?? I only do about 10 men cuts a month so last week i went there to get replacement blades and while i was in line i noticed inside the unopened package the blades were oily and were full of hair, i brought it to the employees attention and she told me to put it to the side and get another, i think i know why my blades are dulling so quickly. I wont be back to that location. I think they are refurbishing used blades and charging for new.. In fact I will not go to a Cosmo Prof again, will be looking for another pro store",1
3058,"Our recent wedding at Inspirador was better than we could have ever hoped!  The venue is beautiful and modern, and accommodates everything from your ceremony, to cocktail hour to reception.  Andrea was our consultant and she could not have been more friendly, helpful, patient and professional...we felt we were working with a real friend.  They take care of all the details for you from little to big, leaving the bridal couple as stress-free as possible the week of the wedding.  Their in-house catering is fantastic...delicious food; and their recommended vendors are all top notch!  We had an amazing experience and wedding thanks to Andrea and the staff at Inspirador.  Every staff person the day of our wedding we encountered was beyond friendly and professional and did just a fantastic job!!  We would highly recommend them to anyone wanting that same great experience on their special day!",5
3059,"If you're a hot dog fanatic like I am, you should definitely try this place! Bulgogi on a hot dog? YEAH!",5
3060,"Extremely happy with the service I get over here, this is my second time here and Enrique helped me out both times, and both times he did a fantastic job. Enrique is very personable and funny, he takes his time to make sure his job is done with perfection. 
I recommend making an appointment when coming in. Don't just walk in and expect to be seated right away. I noticed that every barber here values their work so coming in on a rush, well your better off going to great clips( not to offend great clips, but getting a fresh fade takes time and talent) well I believe I've found my spot so try it for yourselves",5
3061,"I LOVE The Vig!!!  I think I have been here probably 50+ times and have yet to be disappointed. My go-to is the french dip or mac and cheese and a jack and coke. Classic.  The patio is my absolute favorite! Corn hole+a beautifully lit tree+a random cat that always hangs around=my heaven.  

Crazy bonus? I met my boyfriend of 2 1/2 years here on my 23rd birthday!

Update: I married my boyfriend that I met for
the very first time at the Vig! #thanksvig",5
3062,Shitty service from the shitty bartender Tomas.. so I  told the manager we will never be back.,1
3063,"Awesome awesome burgers. We found this little gem while visiting the area. The lady at the cashier was extremely helpful with all the questions we asked. We wanted to order everything in the menu.  The combinations are quite interesting but you can also make your own, which I did.  Burgers took about 10-15 min to be brought to our table but worth the wait. They were delicious and we wanted to go for more.",5
3064,"That's some good chicken! Tasty dippin' sauce and love the sweet tea, too.We stop here every time we go through Vegas and never been disappointed. Wish we had Cane's closer to home.",5
3065,"I needed to find a special place to board my two dogs for a week... I have never boarded them before, always hiring a pet sitter to stay overnight at my house but due to my house sale closing while on vacation that wasn't an option this time... 

 One of my dogs is rather high needs, has severe separation anxiety and will go into seizures when stressed or kenneled so to say I was extremely stressed about this is an epic understatement! 

 We stopped by a few days before I had to leave. Both dogs seemed happy and the staff was confident they would do well in boarding. 

 Drop off day came and it was like taking my kids to kindergarten all over again! :/

 Fast forward a week... I go to pick them up and my high needs dog blows out all happy... and races over to visit with another pair or dogs waiting to come in to doggy daycare.. Torn between being insulted that he didn't care about my arrival and relieved he wasn't stressed out!",5
3075,"Thank you Fabio and Jared for setting up your food truck / pizza oven in our 'hood last night...

Your pizzas were delicious and provided the perfect fuel for both the kids and adults to trick-or-treat for hours!

We thought your prices were moderate at $8 - $9 per pizza... we shared a Margherita, an American, and one with spicy sausage that isn't listed on the website.  I'm bummed I didn't take pictures!

I hear that Fabio also makes appearances at Old Town and Ahwatukee Farmers Markets on occasion and in addition to pizza, they sell fresh bread, cookies and pastries... if those things are made with as much passion as the pizza, then they are definitely worth a shot.

Chef Fabio is available for hire for special events and will bring his mobile wood-fired oven to you (as he did for our Halloween block party last night).  If you hire him, please send me an invitation to join ;)",5
3077,"Delightfully tasty. I was incredibly surprised by this restaurant. It blends in with with the myriad number of other Korean restaurants in the area, and doesn't look special at first glance. 

Decided to give it a try as I was recommended by a friend. Couldn't have been happier to discover this place. Buk Chang Dong has opened my eyes to Korean food and soon tofu. Their dishes are exceptionally delicious, every bite bursting with taste. 

The food can be nice and spicy if you ask, but unlike many other restaurants, spice here mean actual flavour and not just heat they throw in to make it spicy. 

Service is awesome. Super friendly, and fast! Prices are also incredible 

I'd recommend the Bulgogi beef plate #9 and the Kimchi Soon tofu  #3 I think. I wouldn't recommend the Bibimbap, not because it's not tasty, but because the other soon tofu dishes are less mainstream and incredibly satisfying. 

Must try.",5
3078,"I ordered the large plate. Comes with two meats and two large sides along with cornbread. I need a nap now. Chicken was seasoned very well. Also had jerk  chicken, jerk chicken rice, cabbage. I would mention the dessert which is Oreo cake, but I'm too full to eat it at this present time.   definitely worth stopping by if you are in the charlotte area.",5
3079,Great quick healthier meal than a pub and much much better quality. Helpful servers. Can't wait to come back!,5
3080,"Good neighborhood bar/restaurant. Bar for obvious reasons but plenty of seating away from the bar if you wanted to take the kids. Locally owned, great staff good basic menu including apps, burgers, pizza, sandwiches, wraps, etc etc. Tuesday is wing night (.50) good happy hour deals daily. No complaints.",5
3082,"I brought in a couple of watches that just needed some links taken out of them and just general upkeep. 
These guys were professional, quick and reasonably priced. They clearly know what they are doing. The shop is small but it's clean and comfortable. I had no problem waiting the 45 minutes that I did while they finished up.",5
3086,"One of my favourite spots for happy hour in downtown Toronto. Great selection of beers from Belgium, Germany, etc. And their food is pretty good! I would recommend the Cordon Bleu Schnitzel for a meal, or the fries for a snack. Its got a cozy yet impressive atmosphere (think higher-end pubs), so its great for the downtown crowd. It gets pretty lively too as more people finish work and head over. Similar spots (same chain, I believe) are Town Crier, Prenup Pub, and Village Idiot Pub (this last one is just beside Sin and Redemption). Cheers!",5
3087,"If they don't try so hard to up sale you on stuff you didn't go ther for it would be a better experience I just wanted my truck washed, 
For The amount of people around they are pretty slow",1
3088,These guys are great. I had a huge leak in my yard and they came out super quick. They did a great job and were very courteous. He cleaned up everything he touched and was very professional. I would recommend them to anyone. Thanks again for the great work.,5

3091,"GREAT BURGERS  ! I had the chick-un burger with tomato and corn soup and it was the best veggie chicken burger I've ever had.  The soup was alright, it literally just tasted like tomato and corn lol. Server was nice, place is small and cozy, food was fast.",5
3093,"When I bought my older home, it needed a great deal of updating as everything was still original. Tackling remodeling projects can be incredibly trying. Our garage and laundry room was among the ""ugly"" areas that needed some help and we were really hoping it was another project we weren't going to have to try to take on ourselves. We wanted a complete overhaul but after pricing some competitors were beginning to think we might have to settle on our ""wish list.""

We contacted Space Solutions to explore our options and were immediately put in touch with the salesman for our area. He promptly returned our call and came to provide us with a free in home estimate. Paul was our salesman and he was incredibly helpful and professional. He took all of our wish list items and found a way to deliver them, and then some, at a great price. The pricing was so competitive that we ended up with twice the cabinets in the garage that we had hoped for, a work bench that my hubby loves, an added pegboard for more organization of items we were going to need more regularly, great upper cabinets for our laundry room, and we were able to have our garage floor coated, too! 

After clearing out our garage, the garage floor was done one day and that immediately made things look so much better. Our cabinet installation was started within a day or two so that the garage floor was fully dried. Our cabinet installers, were amazing and we were surprised how quickly they worked to complete our project. They made it look so easy, probably because they really are pros at what they do.

We love our garage and laundry room now, they look like something out of a magazine and are the envy of our culdesac... so much that our neighbors decided to have some work done too. :) My hubby loves his ""man cave"". We haven't had any issues with the work that was performed. Next up, contacting them for closets inside our home, we can't wait!",5
3094,"First time going to LA fitness they are very welcoming. Especially Sam the trainer he did not only show me how to work out, but he explained everything thoroughly and gave me the confidence that I could actually reach my goals and made me feel comfortable at all times. I still feel the burn after! I totally recommend Sam!",5
3095,"I got my nails done today. The girl who did it was sweet but, but but my nail polish has already started chipping off, they look untidy and now I need to get this paint off my nails. Not worth the time I spent..! I wouldn't trust Groupon reviews but the yelp reviews next time onwards!",1
3097,"Rice pudding Home made is to die for. Family owned and run. Very friendly staff. They used to offer a salmon version of the greek salad wrap. So so so so so good, but not sure if they still offer it with salmon.",5
3098,"Horrible. It takes them 55min to make 4 sandwiches
(a sad excuse for manager ""calls it""  25 minutes and than offers you a free coffee). Food is mostly blend and tasteless.
Grilled cheese they have as their ""image"" is absolutely horrendous.
Management is incapable of managing the restaurant (they do not realize that you can not run an after midnight restaurant on a skeleton crew, especially on a weekend night)
Fran's food is just as bad, but at least you get it in half the time.",1
3099,Definally the worst experience. Our reservation for prom got cancelled at the last minute without any notification until we called the driver. Funny that we had double checked several times to make sure everything was all set. No followed up no apologies no compensation.,1
3100,Hands down one of the best burger/sports bar places in the area! Food is always great! The staff is so personable and friendly... I have tried about 1/2 there burger menu. That doesn't include the other options I've tried like some of their bowls and today I tried the gyro which was absolutely perfect! I've had to deal with two different bartenders there Josh and Eli are awesome and always ready to give recommendations for newcomers checking out the menu for the first time... If your looking for a great place to bring the family during the week or weekend fun or just a place to enjoy a cocktail or two with good music and a great environment come check out this place! I will come back again and again!,5
3103,"I have been to Dr. Dickens for many many years (since 2004). I have always been VERY happy with the service I've received here. They are friendly, they care about the animals and are compassionate. They've always honored my UPC discount and have been generous in doing so. Their prices ARE very reasonable- believe me, I've called and compared prices with other vets, and have always come here.  I have 4 dogs (an eskie poo and yorkies) and 2 cats. They remind you via mail when it's time for shots and check ups. They are thorough and professional!",5
3104,"Jason is the only garage door professional I will ever need. JDT Garage Door Service stands for fast, reliable, knowledgeable, affordable service. I have used their services for many years, on many different garage doors, and I always refer my friends, family and clients to JDT Garage Door Service.",5
3106,"My new favorite spot!   The interior is cool and open.  The waiting staff top notch.

They have a TON of beers.... many of them local and several that they brew themselves.
Their cucumber beer is our new refreshing summer favorite.  So yummy.

And unlike that other way popular beer hangout place on indian school rd.... this place has top notch food.  We have tried three of their pizzas and they are to die for. Sooooo tasty! ! !

We had passed by this place many times.  The building has Zero curb appeal.... but once inside you will love it.   Maybe this is why it isn't overcrowded like that other place with the not so great food.  So hopefully it will stay a little bit of a secret.",5
3107,"Jim came out to my house today. He is honest and knowledgeable and didn't try and oversell me on anything unlike some other companies in the area. I plan on only using Focus from now on for my plumbing needs. Just say ""no"" to any other company!",5
3110,"I am not kidding when I tell you that they would not let me pay my bill in person.  The account is in my husbands name and because I didn't have his ID, they would not let me make a payment. I had a copy of the statement but evidently I needed to have statement page with a barcode on it.  The manager was useless. I called the card number on the statement and they took the payment with NO ID.  So I can make a payment over the phone with no ID but I can't make a payment IN PERSON with my own ID.  Epic incompetence",1
3113,"I haven't been to the MAC store at the forum shops but I can recommend Jacque Ganigan, who did my makeup for my cousin's wedding earlier this month. She is a whiz with the makeup and has great tips. Her specialties are contouring and eyes.",5

3117,"Went in for a consultation with Jenna was very pleased with the time and attention given to my questions and concerns about my hair.  I was blown away by the service I received on my badly damaged hair.  After a cut, color and protein treatment my hair feels soft and alive again. 
Jenna is definitely two thumbs up in my book and yes I will return !!",5
3118,"Great spot. Get the Lamb & Beef Gyro. I had it twice in one day and it was great both times. It's a tad on the pricy side, but you're also on the strip, so it's not higher than anything else, plus, it's worth it. In exchange for that price tag you get great service, a clean place, and fresh tasting food. I'll be returning as I work nearby.",5
3119,I was getting some meat at this store n my 6 year old points out a little bug. I move the bag of chips n there it was a ROACH ALIVE N KICKING! ! Never will set foot in this place again. My real rating is 0 stars!!!!,1
3127,"If you've never eaten In-N-Out... Yes it's as good as people say. I'm from the east coast and I've had dreams about it when I'm away from it. I prefer my burger straight up but get the fries animal style. The fries aren't my ABSOLUTE fav, but you will not find a better burger from a drive thru window in the entire country. Trust me, I've tried.",5

Delicious. Don't let the empty building around it discourage you.",5
3129,"A city landmark!!! I love love love the CN tower! I've lived in the the GTA for 20 years and always enjoy going to the CN tower, especially when family and friends come to visit. The have added many touristy additions throughout the years such as movies, interactive experiences, etc. 

A tip: go up to see the views an hour or so before sunset that way you see the day time, sunset and night time views.",5

3134,"I am 50 years old.  I grew up eating Rito's fresh baked Italian bread.  I grew up in West Park (Cleveland) and my grandmother lived in Parma Hts.  She would come down West 130th street a couple times a week and always get a load of their bread (from the original West 130th street store).  NOBODY makes bread like Rito's!!!  Soooo soft when it is fresh baked, and add some Country Crock butter....   MMMMM   She would also order a sheet pizza every Christmas.   I am not one for cold pizza.  I like it right out of the oven, but Rito's pizza is AWESOME cold!!  Taste has not changed after all these years.  Sadly, Gram is gone, but I can eat Rito's bread and pizza and it takes me back to my childhood.",5
3135,Best neighborhood Boba! This is the one my whole family goes to all year long.  Cant complain about the drinks they're all really good....only thing is the old lady behind the counter that got mad when i asked her to replace the tea that spilled when the cup cracked.  She was NOT happy. LOL.,5
3136,"I go to BOMBA at least once a month and have never had a bad experience. I  usually sit at the bar where staff is always welcoming. Natalie is an asset to Bomba!
If you are a mojito enthusiast, Bomba is the place. All speciality mojitos are a combination of a fruit or vegetable and an herb. Pours are pretty generous. 
I love the guacamole that comes with three varieties of chips. Spicey black bean dip is a must.  
My favorite tacos are shrimp and also the fried avocado.
I would also recommend their rice bowls!",5

That being said, my latest cut was not even by her, and it turned out fantastic. I literally drive 20 minutes to come here just because I enjoy it so much. I would always recommend to get an appointment for Christine 'cause she is my favorite, but honestly everyone there is fantastic at what they do.

The whole experience with Safelite was great.  The people on the phone were nice despite being very busy.  The guy that replaced my windshield was polite and knowledgeable.  They came to my work and replaced it which was very convenient.  The window looks much better than the old one.  They do great work!",5

3157,5 stars for the food but I should never have to wait for the bartender to finish her personal and very angry yelling phone call to get service.,5

3164,"Because of Yelp I decided to try this salon out and wow am I glad! The owner and her assistant are the only ones who work here. They can handle multiple clients at the same time. When I was there last week there were three of us being served. It's clean, professional, friendly, and AWESOME results. Finding a salon is so hard. I moved across the country a year ago and have had some bad experiences, but this is my hairstylist for now on. She cut and colored my hair. It was a reasonable amount of time and I could not of asked for better. Support this small business. You will be glad you did!",5
3167,"Had to give these guys five stars. Three families all decided to take our hungry kids to a Christmas event at the Irish Cultural Center in the same night that the Electric Light Parade took place. Guess what? Kids are not excited about hand-held meat pie. So we called ahead to let Pizza People know we were coming with a group of 10, with 5 kids under 11. They took our order by phone, and when we got there the table, with drinks, was ready. The food showed up within 5 minutes! The server checked on us regularly and got us out as soon as we were ready, which anyone dining with little kids knows is a priority. This was all while the Pizza People staff was preping and serving a party of over 100  who had been in the parade (Side note: the party all showed up in Christmas gear and it made the night even more special) . 
The adults even got to try some new beers and waaaay better than average pizza! The Testosteronni and Date Me are both winners, and the kiddos polished off 3 pepperoni pizzas. Pizza People saved our night. 
If you're thinking about pizza I'd skip Bianco and head over to Pizza People.",5
3168,I have lived in this complex for the last several years.......previous owners never really handled maintenance problems other then do a temporary patchup.  Since mark taylor purchased property it has hugely improved and getting better each day due to staff.  The management staff...jillian always go the extra mile.  Chris and maintenance staff always do there job in a timely manner even though there are tenants who don't know how to show respect of others in community.  Staff is diligent in dealing with problem tenants.   I highly recommend living here...its my home.  Could be yours.,5

Leave room for the mango sticky rice for dessert its yummy.",5
3172,"Timeframe for this visit was in mid April 2018. We'd been staying nearby, having our RV repaired, & I'd been craving pizza for a while, so stopped in at the Surprise location. I'd read some of the other ratings, but we'd had good experiences before with Barro's & opted to try this one. It was about 8:30pm when we walked in. I can honestly say the best part of our visit was the almost depleted salad bar. Food allergies aside, what was left (lettuce, cheese, sunflower seeds, olives) was perfect for me. Hubby & I ordered a half & half pizza -- half meat, half chicken with a garlic white sauce. My half white was OK, but he crust of hubby's half meat was burnt on the outside. No one was cleaning tables as the few patrons left, so all around us was a mess, including floors. They ran out of coke syrup & ice as we were refilling our beverages, which was the last straw. We left with stomach upsets. I sincerely hope things have improved for the better, but suffice it to say we'll never go back there again. You just can't forget a visit like that one.",1
3174,"Being gluten intolerant, I have found it hard to eat out. Thankfully, Pita Jungle is not only tasty, but the customer service rocks! I came here with a friend around 2pm, looking to split their chicken and hummus plate. Although the pita bread is to die for, I opted for extra veggies. No up-charge, and I was even given extra veggies to go with my left over hummus. Great good, great customer service, and gluten-free friendly is my kind of place.",5
3178,"High heat good quality steaks, great service and a wonderful atmosphere. We have been customers of one AZ Mastro's or another for the last 17 years. There is an overall feeling when you eat at a Mastro's: relaxing, taken care of, satiated. Delicious.",5
3179,"My relatively new iPhone wouldn't  come on, even though, it had never been dropped or soaked.  Researched where to take it and decided on UBreakIFix on Stephanie.  The tech immediately took the phone and was back in less than 10 minutes, saying that he had removed and replaced the battery.  He explained that sometimes there are glitches in the software.  When I asked what I owed, the answer was ""Nothing"".  This place will get all my tech repair business from now on.  Extremely satisfied.

3180,"I was originally sold by the reviews on here and decided it was worth the drive from Surprise. Scottsdale has a ton of choices and this one place caught my eye. I have come to the Carlotti center  5 times or so now and have enjoyed each experience as well as look forward to it. The office is nice, the people are friendly and services are effective. They answer any questions and are very personable. I've been enjoying my results from the ipl treatments I have received and my skin is much more even toned. I've had many of the freckles I had removed.I think freckles are cute ,but the change sure has been nice and has boosted my confidence.I will be back for more in the future .Many thanks to the Carlotti's!",5

3185,"Peppers gets a five-star review for what it is: - a great neighbourhood bar.
The owner is always on duty to make sure that everything is running smoothly and he is always friendly and caring.
It is much favoured by local Portuguese especially from the Azores. The sports on the TV screens reflect this flavour also.
The food is wholesome, basic, and inexpensive.
 There are only two generic beers on tap.
It often has good, free, live entertainment on Thursdays.
It has a fantastic open patio which is in full afternoon and evening sunlight.",5

Later on I bought my xds what I love about coming here is that these people are knowledgeable and do not pressure you into purchasing anything they help you find exactly what your looking for great place to look around with out pressure and they have great deals. Also they have  raffle tickets for a free gun. How can you beat that? And for the negative comments about limited stocked items, prices on ammo , and over priced weapons is wrong! Keep in mind that it's a business and everyone has to make a profit but this place has reasonable prices for NEW not used. I'm definitely going back for my next purchase.",5

The Saimin had no flavor. Just noodles and a Weak broth. I feel like I could've made a pack of ramen noodles and it would've been better than this. Not to mention the signs that say that you can only get one refill and that you can ONLY get rice and Mac win combo meals. I should have taken that as an omen that this place is not somewhere I want to be. Never again. Do yourself a favor and go to Aloha Kitchen. This L&L is gross.",1
3198,"My fianc√© have lived in Pittsburgh for about a year and a half and this was by far the worst food and service we've had living here. 

We had high hopes for the fresh oysters. When they arrived they were served in little plastic Dixie cup shooters and were flavorless and gelatinous.

My fianc√© did like her fish sandwhich but when she told the server she gave her regular Pepsi instead of diet our server rolled her eyes and stormed off.

I do not recommend this restaurant. Please support good food and service in Pittsburgh elsewhere.",1
3199,"It's a party in here! Arriving at 6pm because our first choice had a line out the door, we were seated promptly upon arrival. Tables were full with several birthday parties, but we were seated at the bar, which was nice since it was much easier to hear each other over the yelling (from many, many sake bombs) and loud music. 

Started the evening with drinks. The beer mojito peaked my interest most and I thought it was okay. They may have muddled the mint a little too much since it gave a bitter aftertaste, but otherwise, a nice little concoction there. My friend got the Nama Grapefruit Sour. It's intriguing that you get to juice your own grapefruit, but at least you know it's fresh juice and you're free to moderate how much juice to add. 

For food, we got a few things to share: Zuke Maguro (special menu item), Unagi Bibimbap, Tebasaki, Salmon Tataki and Hojicha Pudding. Most of the dishes were on the sweeter side, but most likely modified to match the Canadian palate. Patrons of this establishment were mixed, but definitely the party type. Music was bumping, many birthdays were celebrated and they do sake bombs in buckets. Yeah...buckets! Lot of yelling, words of encouragement and cheering was involved, but quite a lively atmosphere.

As we finished up, Kinka drew quite the crowd with a full house inside and on the patio deck. I suggest making a reservation if you can and if you want to party it up, the sake bombs are such a show!",5
3200,"I have been doing business with my man Michael close for years, the only reason I keep coming back to CarMax is because of this guy, i have nothing but respect for him, he has the empathy, patience and consistency that no one has, he is very knowledgeable in this business inside out, always keep it professional but makes process super easy and friendly, so for those of you are looking for a car make sure you go see my man Michael close at sahara CarMax! He is the best!",5
3201,Love this place! Sushi is good and also the poke bowls. They have a variety of different foods for everyone. They have 6 different organic teas that are yummy. Definitely recommend.,5
3203,"This is probably one of my favourite Cantonese restaurants in Toronto. The dim sum is much better than what you get in downtown Toronto or down the street (Perfect Chinese Restaurant). Given that it's not as cheap of the Perfect Chinese Restaurant, the taste and freshest is miles better here. During the weekday, dinner service is a bit empty but the seafood is always fresh. The restaurant is clean and really spacious with high ceilings and a relatively modern interior.

As for mall, Dragon Centre, it's definitely changed from being one of the busiest Chinese malls in Scarborough during its high time when it was one of the first Chinese malls to being pretty run down and back to getting its charm again. The area is being in the process of being developed to a office complex - so I'd recommend stopping soon before things start rolling with development. 

It's a family run place, which I like because it means the owner is pretty hands on (you won't miss him) looking after the food. 

Some of my favourite dishes are the Hong Kong style Lobster, the roast chicken with sticky rice, and the mango sticky balls with whipped cream and fruit stuffing.",5
3205,"Mike was professional, direct and honest about our home's position in the market (we considered it a ""unique"" property), and persistent in getting it sold. We especially appreciated his weekly updates and constant attention to assessing our options and making adjustments to keep the listing active and getting attention. Working with Michelle was also a pleasure. She made sure we were kept informed and handled all of the details seamlessly. We recommend them highly!",5
3207,"This was our third visit.  The absolute BEST sushi in town.  Tonight was our first opportunity with Happy Hour.   Great value pointed out by Jade, our wonderful server.  We tasted grilled squid, miso black cod ( the definition of Unctuous) and the edamame for the kids.  Fabulous.  Then had the Blind Phoenix for hubby ( I am allergic to tuna) and he loved it.  We asked for tagaroshi on the side and Jade totally got it.  Brendan did a great job running the food.  Our 17 year old son loved the ramen and our 9 year old daughter ate the chicken with ramen noodles. She loved it.

We had salmon and cream cheese and many other roles.  The spider was my favorite.

Josh, the manager spoke to us and appreciated our comments.  A great experience!",5
3208,Awesome breakfast. Everything was good. Contemporary layout but still welcoming. The chicken and waffles are huge!!,5
3209,"My hopes were high entering the restaurant, and I was so happy that the restaurant exceeded my expectations!  The pecan chicken is to die for!  I will be coming back again and again!",5
3211,"Almost $2 for a double cheeseburger???  Really???  I just turned 53, and I've eaten McDonald's since I was 14.  Your food ain't all that.  A coworker was going by for lunch. I gave him $3 to get two double cheeseburgers. The receipt said, with tax, $1.83, for one.  Damn, I'll do 7eleven first. Two bucks gets me a kick ass chicken sandwich.  You need to lower your prices and improve quality of your food.  I'll stay away until then.  Way too many places to eat and spend my money at.",1
3212,The staff is always great with my little fur babies and I appreciate the follow up phone calls. Thank you for all your help with my pets!,5
3215,This place is fantastic! Vicki is such a sweet waitress and the food was amazing and cheap.,5
3218,"It is located in the casino. The drinks are decent, the service is great, and the pizza is grand. They often have drink specials and their is always a game on the screens around the bar. I have only tried the pizza. I keep saying I will try other things on the menu but the pizza gets me everytime.",5
3219,"I heard good word about this place so I decided to try it myself. Needless to say I was extremely pleased by Banjara; the flavour and quality of their food, the friendly service,  the unique seating arrangment....it had it all! It's also not too out of the way as it is located  within a 5 min walk from Christie subway station.

I sat in their full windowed seating area wherw I was given a complimentary basket of chip/cracker things (I have no idea what they're called,  but I attached a picture and can assure you they were veeerryyy tasty!). I went with the chicken tikka masala, my brother and dad ordered the chicken vindaloo and the vutter chicken platter respectively. We also ordered a side of garlic rice and plain naan.

Everything was delicious! Average sized portions, and even a little cheaper in price than standard Indian restaurants charge. Nothing was too spicy, or chewy; zero negativity!  The plain naan was perfect for all the sauce included in tue main meat diah. Although the platter certainly offered more variety, I would recommend that if you know what main dish you enjoy (like chicken tikka masala in my case), have an order of that and get either a side of rice or naan to conpliment the main dish. 

Only thing I wasn't crazy about was their rice pudding (included in the platter), I simply found it very sweet, but I can see how others may enjoy it :) 

I will most certainly return to Banjara, and if you're ever craving Indian cuisine,  this is the place to come!",5
3220,Whoa. This place is too expensive for what you get. $55= a rip off. There is only so much a person can eat for that much. The food is also mediocre.,1
3221,"I would highly recommend them.  Installed exactly what I wanted in a professional manner.  The price was very fair compared to others, and the work was done professionally.  I watched the whole installation, and was impressed.",5
3222,I like coming to this location because their crew is always friendly and their service is fantastic! They are fast and get the sandwich made to your every specification and no special request is beneath this crew!,5
3223,Daniel J has been nothing but awesome. He has always been friendly and has always done an excellent job on my hair. He is very informative and has great recomendations as well as always consulting with me upon every visit. I love my hair everytime I leave here. Daniel J is one of the best!!,5
3226,I've gone to Paul twice so far and even though he is quiet he does the job perfectly. I have LOVED my nails each time he has done them.,5
3227,"Super rude employees. Please don't go here. Whenever I visited, I feel like I'm begging for their foods. Everything here from food to service is below the standard. I wish I could give 0 star.",1
3229,"My mother was admitted to the new hospital wing at RV for awhile this springtime, and I was so impressed in the care and attention she got at this new facility.  She was taken into non emergency and we didn't wait very long until she was finally moved to an area which was private, and it only took her one day to get her admitted into her own room.  

While in emergency however, you are enclosed in a curtained area and even though you had some sort of privacy, you are able to hear the conversations of the hospital staff.  This was quite a humorous thing for me, as private things were disclosed in staff dialogue and my mother and I could hear everything very loud and clear.  Staff would enter my mother's area perform their professional duties, leave and continue their conversations on the so and so relationship of this doctor with this nurse, what happened the weekend before etc.  I couldn't help but feel like I was in the cast of Grey's Anatomy.

So let me get to the rooms at RV, wow her room was fantastic, it was a huge private room with huge windows overlooking the Rocky Mountains.  The nurses, attendants and the doctors there were friendly, attentive and extremely caring; my mother had the best care and was so well taken care of. A team of specialists then spoke with me personally at another meeting and we all discussed the best possible options for my mother in terms of the future steps that needed to happen to ensure her safety and well being.

5 stars Rocky View!",5
3230,"oh my god! is all i can say !! First of all the most important part... THE FOOD IS INCREDIBLE!! Its a beautiful place, they treated us like family! The portabello mushroom fries &  the macaroni and cheese was ahhmazzzing !! and of course the steak... I'll never go anywhere else !!",5
3231,"Best I have found in NW Las Vegas!  i was spoiled with San Fernando Valley sushi, and have been so disappointed with local faire.  Umami has great atmosphere, excellent quality and the sushi presentation is top notch! We will be back very soon!",5
3232,"Pretty disappointed in this Pizza Hut location. First, I should have just picked it up, considering it is two blocks away from my house, and there must have been a huge delivery charge due to the fact that one stuffed crust pizza with 1 1/2 toppings and one small order of wings was $28... Anyway, we asked for the pizza to be uncut and par baked so that we could bake it to our liking once it arrived an hour and a half later, but they couldn't even do that for us because it came almost fully baked and cut (now how are we supposed to put it in the oven?). Also, they failed to give us our blue cheese dressing for our wings. Also this is Monday at 11am when they opened, so I'm not sure how it took that long to prepare ESPECIALLY since they weren't even supposed to cook it all the way. Shitty.",1
3234,"I should have read some of the bad reviews first, before going to that place for lunch. The service was ok, although the waitress forgot to bring out the soup that came with our meal. She rectified that later when our main dishes were already out. My husband ordered mongolian beef, which was good. I ordered sweet and sour chicken, what I got was Kung-Paoish chicken. We also ordered a roll since it was half off. Sakana makes the same roll way better. My chicken tasted ok, however 4 hours later I had food poisoning. It definitely was my chicken that I had for lunch, since I had not eaten anything else. I will not return and strongly advise against going to this place.",1
3235,"Saturday morning we got a late start but came up this way on a recommendation from love. This spot is located in a very fun area in the strip district where there's old warehouses, fun shops and open air markets. So as a fan of all three- I was in heaven. We came up this way and at first struggled with parking and a decent traffic flow, but managed to snag a spot and do some walking. Upon walking in we were greeted and explained how things work- order up front and scoop a table. Decor is very barn style and colorful with different chairs, looks of wood etc. 

They serve breakfast all day, which is a huge plus for me personally. I could eat breakfast all year. However, from looking at the menu they all have salads and sandwiches and plenty to choose from. Not to mention homemade scones, cookies, and pastries up front as well. Man man man.

We ordered some breakfast and coffee and tea respectively- and took our seat and hung out. Planning your day over coffee while waiting for breakfast is low key my favorite activity on a Saturday so this hit the spot. 

Food was INCREDIBLE. I went with the omelette with bacon cheese and spinach. It was quite possibly the largest, thiccest, fluffiest omelette I have had. Also- was served with home fries which I didn't see on menu. Another added plus. Home fries had a nice flavor and kick to them, and condiments are available on the table. 

Coffee was good as well- though I would've liked to have more options on dressing it besides just room temp half and half. 

Great spot. I love it and you and I will be back.",5
3236,"Fantastic service, Chef Juno is a character! 

We tried the omakase (deal for $35), the squid was incredibly tender and buttery, the bluefin tuna was also soft and flavorful. The seared mackerel was also my favorite, smoky flavor, seared salmon was soft and melt in your mouth.

We also ordered scallop nigiri which was one of my favorites, buttery and soft. We ordered seared salmon and seared tuna, both fantastic.

The omg roll was a fiery show and also tasty-- great for my dad who wanted something cooked.",5
3237,"I usually don't write reviews despite having gone to quite a few restaurants, but I've had a consistently good experience here. For a $10 meal, the quality, quantity, service, and setting can't get much better. 

I've tried the noodles with bone soup, the beef soup, the peanut (dandan) soup, and the szechuan soup and they don't cheat to make it taste good with fat and salt. The portion size is outrageous and the meat quality is quite good too. Don't get turned off by their new menu design, which will remind you more of poor quality all you can eat hotpots in Chinatown. It seems the Chinese way is to showcase as much variety as possible but in this case the variety is all good so far. I would give it a 4.5 stars as the appetizers are a bit underwhelming in comparison and there is no liquor license, but otherwise this is a pretty authentic Chinese noodle soup experience if you get tired of the ramen and pho around town. No comment on the rice, pancake, or fish options yet... 

After settling your bill, there is an additional option to spin a prize wheel and we've won 5/5 times, one of which was a free meal where they handed back the full $10 in cash... just ridiculous. I'll definitely be coming back and am writing this review as I fear they don't get enough customers and won't be open for very long. 

It used to be called Noodle Face but is called Fish noodle now, however it is essentially  the same restaurant I believe... having read the other reviews perhaps it's changed owners again so could be worth a second try for those who had bad experiences before.",5
3238,"Such a great concept, I love the campy atmosphere. The cocktails are so yummy I will be back to try them all! I recommend trying the firefly cocktail and the camp burger with jalape√±os and bacon!",5
3239,"All three guys who work there are great.they know their and what they are talking about. Easy to say that about any other shop,but they actually know what they are doing . The employees are experienced,by many years. Very friendly people, and very helpful. I can't stress enough about how well they know their stuff. All in all, i would recommend Vapestarinc to everyone i know  thx guy's",5
3241,Lots of variety for a $8.95 lunch buffet! The Samosa was delicious and the buffet included garlic naan and mango lassi. Carrot Halwa and Gulab jamun were good too. There were other desserts too but I didn't try them. Perhaps next time!,5
3242,"Hailan Q has done my nails twice at BBL and I have been very impressed both times.  She is now my go to nail gal!  Her work is meticulous and she doe beautiful 3d art.  All her products are top notch and she is a perfectionist which shows in the end product.  Cleanliness is without question.

The shop itself is clean and bright and everyone I've met working there is very friendly and professional.  I'm very tempted to give a try on the lash extensions next!

Also of note, the shop is located inside/beside the hairsalon Cutting Room Floor.  I have not had my hair done there but you can hear the gals in the shop and they always sound like they are having fun with their customers.  Too bad I'm not in the market for a new stylist.",5
3244,"There wasn't a thing we didn't like about our 5 nights here.  

The hotel has a nice vibe, is ultra clean and the rooms are modern yet elegant.  I loved the spacious shower.  

Beds are VERY comfortable, the amenities are great and we enjoyed the rooftop restaurant too.

Breakfast was included for us, and was very good.  Plenty of great choices, and well prepared.  The manager brought us over a couple of Americano coffees one morning, and they were superb.  

Great location, close to a lot of things, and a very helpful concierge service to help book nearby restaurants and other sights.  Thank you Julien for your help.

With around 70 nights a year on the road, this hotel was in the top ... 3.  Maybe even the best.  Well worth a visit.  You won't be disappointed.",5
3245,Best pizza and pasta in middleton west side of Madison extremely great service everytime the pizza or past is made of  great fresh ingredients convenient reasonable fresh good food good service prompt there is nothing better than novanta take out alcohol and good love ur shit,5
3246,"Macs has the best house ground hamburgers.  I like mine with lettuce and tomato, Heinz 57 and French fried potato.  There is also a varied selection of both local and nationwide craft beer.  I personally like the Huevos Rancheros, a Bloody Mary and NFL or College football on the weekends.  FYI.... The are open for breakfast for the early games.  All in all a good ole regular neighborhood eatery!",5

3249,"My wife and I both were first time customers to Val Vista Vision. Before going in I knew that I had monovision and a astigmastism. I knew that I could only get glasses, my wife though was told that she was a good candidate for contact lenses. Val Vista Vision charges $135 non-refundable fee. That fee went towards finding the correct contact, training and fitting for her. Her 1st pair (of contacts) my wife could not see distance or in low light level. She went in to see Dr. Stacie Eskew again and was told she had monovision. Dr. Eskew should have recognized this in the 1st exam. My wife went in several times to try different contacts and was told there no more options (she could not see distance in any of them) and she had to wear glasses. She asked since none of the contacts worked, to have partial of the $135 to go towards glasses and was told by contact lens specialist that they would not do that. We were disappointed, thinking Val Vista Vision would have better customer service than this. We will not return as customers or recommend them.",1
3251,"Travis treated us like royalty from the start to the end of our family dinner for four. He made terrific recommendations and even let us sample some of the sides so we could make just the right choice with our meals. The brisket was delectable, the steak tender and tasty, the ribs were moist and meaty. We simply loved the cornbread and the Q rolls. Travis kept our drinks freshened, but never hovered or made us feel uncomfortable as we enjoyed our meal and family celebration. We are already planning our next visit and plan to ask for Travis by name.",5
3254,"I absolutely love this place. Having the option for Chinese and sushi on the same menu saves me so much hassle when I have guests who don't do sushi when I'm craving it. Their lo mein dishes somehow magically double in size when you open the container and their crab rangoon is the best I've had. Other favorites are the hot and sour soup and they have a really great ginger dressing for their salads which is hard to find. The star for me is the sashimi, though. Thick cuts of incredibly fresh fish cut with expertise is reason enough to keep coming back, especially given their lunch specials. The staff is fantastic and always remembers me. I highly recommend it.",5
3255,Wow me and my hubby just tried the philly cheese steak and Icant believe all this time ive never order it ...ITS A MUST TRY,5
3256,"I went to get my car serviced and was asked by a worker if I had been helped and I told him no.  He then asked what I was there for and I told him I had an appointment at ten, he asked who it was with and I said I didn't know, but he didn't ask me my name or what it was for but said he would check on it and just walked away. After waiting ten minutes and staring at the workers just talking in front of me a worker from the inside came out and saw me staring at them and asked if I had been assisted, I advised I had not and had been waiting.  He was quite helpful but the others workers that were just standing around were making me quite angry.  My car was then taken and I provided my phone number for them to call me when the car was ready, I went to go get a bite to eat and by now two hours had passed and I hadn't received a call. I went back to the dealership and waited for about another 30 min for a call and by then I was becoming quite upset so I went up to the cashier and asked how much longer my car was going to be. She asked for my name and when she pulled my paper work she asked if I was waiting this whole time and I said yes.  She gave me my paper work and I asked how long my car had been ready, she then called the guy who was working on my account and he said he called when he was done and the number was not in service. I got a little upset and said my phone is right here and it is in service, I asked what number he dialed because the number that was on my paper work was correct and he said that he called the # that the guy wrote down when he took the car.  It was a digit off and it wasn't my fault it was the guy who took the car and he should have called my number that was in the system. THE CAR HAD BEEN READY FOR TWO HOURS, THIS WAS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAD EVER EXPERIANCED AT A DEALERSHIP AND IT WAS MY FIRST TIME THERE.  What a way to make an impression!!",1
3258,Amazing service and value. Work was done cleanly and efficiently. TVs mounted perfectly. Also appreciated them making a media shelf in my garage to store electronics out of the way to free up floor space. Even had help moving an old Ikea media center. I will be using them again when I get new televisions and electronics!,5
3260,"The only ""bill"" I received was a notice from the debt collection agency.....almost a year after the service. My bill was $40.....$40!!! I would've paid it right away when I got the bill, if I got the bill but nope, never came. When I called Chandler Radiology they tell me they can't speak to me about it because it's been sent to collections. I told them I never even received a bill and again he tells me I need to call collections. Luckily for me, collections tells me it won't be put on my credit report until 30 days following the notice to collect. Then they say there's a fee to pay online or over the phone by credit card. Ok, any other way to pay? Nope. $42.50 later i'm hoping it doesn't go on my report and annoyed with this ridiculous billing department at Chandler Radiology.",1
3261,"Dr. Roach, his team, and his practice are all exceptional!!! From the minute you walk in, you know you're in the best hands. Not only are the vet and his team incredibly warm and friendly and the fees super reasonable - and the services provided white glove in their delivery and care - but West Russell is also the best place to board an animal. 

Regarding boarding - the dog runs are clean, big and welcoming! (They have several options re: size and with or without watch-at-home cameras.) Our Whippet has stayed here several times for long weekends and she always seems happy and rested when we pick her up. Plus, her tail wags as she runs in to the place every time we come to drop her off. Stop by, take a tour, meet the team - you'll know this is the best vet practice possible!",5
3262,"We came here earlier this month for my wife's birthday dinner. We've eaten here a couple of times before so not a first time experience. 

I just want to say the prime rib is amazing! Along side with a loaded baked potato also amazing! They even gave us free cheesecake!

A nice place to have a good dinner with great service. I will be back for sure:)",5
3263,"One star is being kind! Not only was I dissatisfied with the effort that was put in to clean my home,  (Barely dusted, lightly mopped, grime was still on stove, disgusting grime left under my toilets, etc. etc.) when I complained I got a manager calling me back and telling me that even though I paid the $110 for the full size and square footage of my house that they were not required to clean one whole bedroom and one whole bathroom. It was completely ignored and not even touched. They never even entered the room or bathroom. $110 was the service fee and I tipped  $30 (obviously before I saw what a crappy job they did) and they still cannot come out and clean this part of the house that they missed. Instead she argued with me that it wasn't included in the square footage of my house. Even though with the same service it was always cleaned it before. The reason why I pay a hefty  service fee is to clean all of my bedrooms and bathrooms. The manager then argued with me the reason as to why they didn't clean very well is because they were here for their full allotted three hours. Who knows what they were doing those three hours but they definitely were not cleaning the whole time.. A cleaning job should not go by time as  it will just let them be lazy and work less since they know they have to leave in three hours anyways. it should go by how well the house is cleaned. Steer clear of this service.  They suck. Not only are the maids lazy, but the management is not what it should be. Very unprofessional to argue with the customer.Extremely, extremely dissatisfied!!! Oh! I forgot the yard service that is provided with the fee was just as bad. The guy came out and blew around a few leaves actually making more of a mess. Left weeds and was in and out in five minutes. So ridiculous.",1
3266,Amazing! Same  day delivery. And beautiful choices and arrangements.  No problems on line.  Very quick professional and didn't put me on hold like other places did.,5
3267,"I love this place! I'm lucky a friend introduced this sushi restaurant to me, I don't go to any other sushi restaurants anymore. The staff is always very nice and very helpful. They're rolls are creative and wonderful, my new favorite is the Light & Crunchy Tofu Roll. I highly recommend this place and will be back time and again.",5

3271,"They did a very good job on my forerunner. We spent the weekend camping up on the Mogollon Rim and the truck was covered in mud and dirt inside and out.

 I got the VIP for $19.99 which would cover the inside and out plus tire and dash dressing. I was was any ly surprised when I got it back and they had done a stellar job getting and the entire truck was clean. They even did the inside of the door jams. 

It wasn't quick. I think they spent 40 minutes total on it but it looks great.",5
3275,Great service and my meal was perfectly cooked. Highly recommend checking this great Portuguese restaurant.,5
3276,"We had reservations for 5:00 PM on Friday night before seeing Celine Dion.  We were seated promptly and everything flowed smoothly.  

The four of us shared an order of stone crab claws as an appetizer, the ladies has Alaskan king  crab claws as entrees, brother-in-law had steak and I had the grilled seafood platter with shrimp, scallops and lobster tail.  

Everything, as expected, was excellent.  Service wss on point and out server was extremely helpful with dinner choices.

Highly recommended!",5
3277,"Mary is kind, thorough, and professional. Highly recommended!",5
3278,"Giving it a one star until I've actually been seated, and get to experience this place. I went for a friend's birthday, and we waited an hour and a half, and never got seated or served. We didn't even get asked if we wanted to wait inside and order drinks. 
I understand it was bottomless mimosas Sunday, and it was busy, but I don't understand why they couldn't seat a table of 8 in around 45 minutes. We checked again at an hour and a half, and there were 8 tables in front of us still waiting. 
I saw several tables being used by people who were just drinking. I don't understand why they couldn't prioritize clients who were willing to spend on eating and drinking. 
Anyways, not worth the wait. Go across the street to Salty Senorita's, save the time and get better service (without the eye rolls from the hostesses). 

Also, I'm disappointed this is a Giants bar. I would have returned to watch games here but not anymore. Oh well.",1
3279,"This is a wonderful coffee place. The owners are welcoming and good-hearted. The flavored coffee changes daily, so check out the flavor. The food is reasonable and made from scratch. I had taken my daughter for a tea-party. So cute! She received hot chocolate, healthy snacks, and a little gift. We like to sit out on the little patio. It is peaceful, and it was built by the owners. The hours are 7-3pm, Monday- Friday.",5

3282,"I don't think Vegas hotels get much better for this price point. Our room had a beautiful view of the Strip. But going to the Wynn and staying in your room is like going to Disneyland and staying in the parking lot!

Love it :) Love it :) Love it :) Love it :)",5
3283,"Awesome wonderful and fun! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for something 'different' to do near las Vegas. Even though we were the 'old peeps', we had a great time , lots of laughs. Wonderful ( and helpful) guides. Saw wild sheep, bald eagle, lizards and the elusive roadrunner, huge fish, Hot springs too! Thanks for a fun time!",5
3284,"Honestly, I might go broke if I lived within the general vicinity of this mecca of grocery stores.... This is the creme de le creme of Fry's, hands down the best single grocery store in all of Metro Phoenix.

~What To Do~
Way too much. First you can shop for pretty much any specific grocery need you can think of. They have a Coldstone inside....yes, Coldstone. They have a coffee shop, a car rental counter, a valet.... they also have a cigar/wine bar which specializes in wine flights...and a top flight sushi station. *gasps for breath*

~The Good~
Oh, there is so much good. This place is stocked to the gills with extras that we can only dream of at other locations. Their specialty bread area, with artisan breads is surprising. The wine bar looks nice, although I haven't personally tried it myself. Its hard to explain this spot, other than it is a Fry's on steroids. The food is a bit nicer, and each aisle or section has different higher end items that you just don't see elsewhere. This is Fry's answer to Whole Foods and Sprouts, yet at a Costco size level. You simply must go... like Nike, Just Do It.

~The Bad~
WELL..... If you need a scooter, your battery might run out trying to see everything (I'm sorry about that God, that was my bad). If you loathe walking, in other words, then do not go here... All joking aside, the only negative I see is the location. It serious just plays directly to its clientele, upper class Scottsdalians (or w/e you call them, haha). People like myself in Central Phoenix and he surrounding cities are left in the dust, and its completely out of the question thinking about driving to shop here. Ha ha, no way. That's my biggest issue, just simply the fact that they placed this so far away from the other cities... meh..

~The Down Low~
Despite the location issue, this place is too great to lose even a half a star. There is too much good stuff.  5 stars for the typical good service, large selection, additional never-before-seen amenities, and the comparability of service to that of higher-end grocery chains. This place steps its game way up. Scottsdale, you are lucky!!!!!!!!",5
3285,"I must say I was born & raised in Scottsdale & I have not had better tacos than Wadda street tacos!!!! So addicting!!!!!!! The staff is incredibly friendly every time I'm there but & the owner Miguel is such a gentleman & definitely knows what hes doing when it comes to his Tacos!!!! Love the carne esada on some corn tortilla throw some cheese on that bitch top it off with lime, pico, cabbage, guacamole, & more cheese then boom- orgasm in your mouth!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5
3286,"We got to visit this restaurant while we were in Montreal. The location was easy to find, and luckily we were able to find parking as well. It's located on a small street, which doesn't have much parking near by. The restaurant does require reservations for large groups. We had about 6 people with us as we walked in, not knowing about reservations we asked to be seated. The manager had told us he would have to see if we can be seated. At this point we were a little disappointed. But he came back with good news and seated us at a table. The menus were designed in a old fashion, which made the restaurant unique. The food was delicious and had just the right amount of spice. As a person from a Indian background, I was pleased with the food. The restaurant was clean and well maintained. I will definitely be going back when I'm in Montreal!",5
3291,"This is seriously THE WORST experience I have ever had at a spa...

I bought the travelzoo deal, which includes a facial, a massage and a smoothie.

Upon my arrival, I was greeted by one of the receptionist.. I was notified that I will need to take out the smoothie as they will be closing once my massage is done. I wish I was notified that when I made the appointment so I can come in earlier to use the facilities.

I was brought to the women lockers room and there was literally 15 people in a tiny room. The receptionist look through every single locker and realize they were all empty. So she ran out to get me new towels and bath robes.. The impression I got is that they are not ready for my arrival at all.

Moving onto the massage and facial- it was decent but the lady barely speaks English. After I finished the treatments, she tried to sell me their facial products. I didn't even know what was applied to my face at that point -_- zero interest in buying their products.

Overall, nothing comparable to any 5* hotels spa that I have been to. I felt even more stressed out after my treatment lol.

Don't go!!!!!",1
3292,"Mimi is shit over charged. For a crappy service , hair cut and colour. Do not know want kind of salon they are running but it honestly sucks. I had to go buy extensions on how short this lady cut my hair. Do not come here it's literally by far the worse hair salon ever! You will regret going there. Everything about that salon and service is wrong. You all need to go back to hair school!!!!",1
3293,"Actual rating 4.5. Venue and cocktails bump up the rating.

For a Saturday evening the No1DP and I wanted to do a ""dinner and show"" date Vegas style. For us, this meant either fine dining or upscale casual with a named chef. He already booked the show way in advance and left me in charge of planning dinner. As the show we were going to was a fun show in New York-New York, I didn't want to go anywhere too extravagant. 

VENUE
1) Chef Rick Moonen is well known for his seafood restaurant ""rm seafood"" in the lower level. This is his take on comfort food in large and small plates made to be shared.
2) Restaurant is decorated in Victorian period steampunk-style. Prominent features are that the women are dressed in bustiers, which the No1DP noted to be different for each waitress. This was confirmed, letting the waitress express herself while conforming to dress code. Furniture pieces were appropriate to the time. Sofa was comfy.
3) A cocktail program managed by the talented Eric Smith, who kinda looks like the current Doctor with glasses.

SERVICE: Staff took care of us. Waiters attended to us, bussers served our food and I had a little chat with Eric himself. 

DRINKS: Cocktail menu is served on an iPad. No1DP noticed that you can e-mail your orders. I hope he used this feature for the wines as I am having a total brain fart for not remembering the exact wines we had. I tend to do this for restaurants with notable cocktail menus as I tend to pay attention to the cocktails more :/

No1DP got the Smoked Whiskey and Cola ($15). The whiskey is smoked to order with cherrywood chips. The cola is a housemade concoction with various spices as to not make the coke too sweet and enhance the smokiness of the whiskey. No1DP never had anything like this before and enjoyed his drink.

I got the Mario Took the Wrong Pipe ($14). I actually had a talk with Eric about this particular drink. Caipirinhas are one of my most favorite cocktails and I was impressed on his method of using cacha√ßa - mixing it with cura√ßao, egg whites and extra virgin olive oil to make the drink a lot more smooth than the caipirinha and still have that burst of citrus each sip. Finally cacha√ßa is used in a cocktail other than a caipirinha!

For our dishes No1DP got an oaked Chardonnay and I got a Cabernet. Wine parings were sufficient, the tannins went well with our quite savory dishes. 

FOOD
Rx Fish Tacos in Taro Root Shells ($12): The kampachi is done as a ceviche and the ""taco"" shell is delicate enough that the taco could fall apart mid-bite and the fish flavors and textures can shine through.

Lamb Osso Bucco Greek Style ($28): I've had veal osso bucco in the traditional Italian style and I like this interpretation better. The lamb is braised so that the meat is tender and falls off the bone. The meat is covered in its own juices and the orzo soaks these juices nicely. There were two pieces of lamb cut perfectly for sharing. 

Lobster Bolognaise ($38): Pasta was perciatelli. Lobster and pasta were also prepared to be shared. I could still taste the lobster even with the bolognaise sauce. No1DP notes that the pasta was just a tad too chewy.

Moonen Tater Tots ($9): Big tater tots that were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Potatoes were not greasy. Decent, but might pick another side next time.

Cookies & Milk ($9): Made to order chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies. Milk poured nicely as it had a higher cream content. Outside was crisp so cookie didn't fall apart but center was moist and chewy. Cookies were rich yet lost some of its richness and moistness the next day.

The No1DP and I had such a great time that we ended up being a little late to our show. We noticed that the restaurant was empty for a Saturday night and hope that this restaurant will still exist the following year. The cocktails bridge the gap between the comfort food and the Victorian steampunk theme; while the cocktails can survive without the restaurant, the restaurant cannot survive without the cocktails. If the restaurant does close I hope that Eric's cocktails can survive in some other form.",5
3295,AWESOME Pediatric Dentist!  I worked with Dr. V side by side for two years and would certainly trust him taking care of my children!,5
3296,"Yum Status!

I just moved to the area so I thought I would check this place out. I was greeted by a lady that explained the whole ordering process since it way my first time and she was very nice and helpful.

But skip to the food...
OMG YUM!!! I was a huge fan of Taco El Gordo and when they shut down the location on the strip I was very sad. BUT, this place to me, is better! It's more fresh and the home made tortillas are delicious. 

Expect me to be a regular. Best tacos EVER!!!",5
3299,"I've held off on this review for quite a while, but after strike 3 here I felt compelled to finally write my review. I'm sure this might be hit or miss, but at least this experience has repeated itself.

The concept of the build your burger and of course the Hubert endorsement is a reason that fills the seat, but my love for the Burger Bar unfortunately stops there.

I have gone on 3 separate occasions and the first 2 I have had issues with the burger and recently it was now my wife who had the ""Irish Luck"" with Lunch.

The first two times I had the build your burger and both times they had come out raw vs. the medium that was requested. I normally am not a complainer when I eat, but for something like that getting sick is not my forte.

Recently I went and this time it was my wife's burger that was red and dripping blood which was inexcusable. She ordered sliders and she even said it best ""how can you undercook a small patty""?

Beyond those experiences, I feel the overall flavor of the burger itself is just not there. I was looking for a little kick or at least something that doesn't leave me looking for a soda or a ""dolled up"" milk shake. I'm now on the hunt for a new burger establishment to satisfy my requests.",1
3300,"We have purchased a pool,spa and surround, and a Big Green egg from Renaissance Pools and have had a great experience with each purchase.  We have been extremely happy with both the service and products in each case.  We would gladly recommend them to anyone.",5

3305,"I had high hopes for Congee Phoenix as it was close to where I live and the interior actually was modern-ish sorta like Asian Legend. Congee was actually decent and service was ok-ish but upon taking some leftovers home, we found a huge blue elastic band at the bottom of the congee, as well as a long piece of hair. EW!!

We suspect it was a hair band or something, needless to say, we'll continue to make the trek to Market Village for Congee.",1

-Sandwiches
-Almond croissant

3307,Renu was awesome! I saw her reviews on Yelp and made the decision to see her for eyebrow threading. I've gone several times to the mall for eyebrow threading and it was just okay but also painful  Renu is very gentle....almost painless. She truly listened to what i wanted and gave me suggestions. She will be the only one I see for eyebrow threading.,5
3308,"A few months ago my son and I went to this location and enjoyed a marvelous experience with great food, and a brilliantly wonderful waitress that I left a 50% tip.  Believe me, she was amazing!  This time we were so excited as it would be our second visit and let me tell you, I left the waitress a 0% tip.  This is something I never did before.  After we put our order in we noticed people coming in after us, getting their food, paying, and leaving.  I kept looking for our waitress while trying to keep my son entertained, but she forgot we were even there.  Then she came and told us that the kitchen was backed up.  Yes, she lied.  If she had been honest and said she forgot to place the order I would have understood as we all make mistakes.  She chose to lie, when we had eyes to see others eating.  Then we waited even longer.  Like, really long considering I got a very simple salad, and my son got the fajitas.  Nothing that should take so long.  Well, it was my son's first experience with fajitas, and I explained to him how they come out sizzling in the pan, and the smell is incredible.  Luckily, the table next to us, which came in 30 minutes after we placed our order had also ordered the fajitas and my son was able to experience that excitement vicariously.  It would still be 45 minutes before his showed up.  No sizzle, no smell, and a bit on the cooled off side.  My salad was soggy from sitting around so long, and drizzled in queso fresco, which I asked to be left off because I'm vegan.  Oh, and thanks for the burnt flatbread, that just made it all so much better.  And I'm talking about the bottom and edges being charcoal black and disintegrated.  Trying to get her back again after she threw our plates in front of us and ran off was ridiculous.  There was no point because she was done.  So she forgot to place our order, forgot to pick it up when it came out, ignored us until another worker (twice) sent her to our table, lied to us, didn't offer a dessert or a drink refill for myself.  Thankfully she did refill my son's lemonade while looking me in the eye and lying about the kitchen staff.  The vast contrast of service we received during those two visits was off the charts.  Therefore, lady, your tip is backed up.  Look for it in the mail.",1
3311,"Beautiful. Clean. & Steller VIEW of Vegas.

I was very impressed with the staff & room.  Quick service to getting a room at last minute.  

 ALTHOUGH they give you a complimentary bottle of wine with your stay, but no bottle opener in the room.  We had to call down and have them bring one up and then had to pay 5.00 for it, to have it be a piece of crap but i understand the whole reason behind it.

the bed and bedding was uber soft and cozy which made for a good nights sleep, flat screens, mini bar, HUGE bathroom with spa tub & shower. 

they have plenty of shopping, gambling, dining & shows here.

i may or may not stay here again, to many other choices of course but it's not a place i would turn down.",5

3314,"Do not go to this place. I felt uncomfortable when I walked in and they refuse to do my nails because I have psoriasis instead of educating their staff on psoriasis the manager fought with me via text and would not refund my money. Yes and I already paid for it. I felt like I was in a nightmare and I couldn't get out of it I have never seen such poor customer service in my entire life. Please do yourself a favor and stay away from this unprofessional unsavory and discriminative environment.

Also I was told if I didn't like it call Groupon and get my money back their hours are terrible for Groupon customers to get manicures and pedicures which is not on the Groupon coupon if I had known they only took customers between 12 and 3 I would have never bought the Groupon. I heard numerous times call Groupon and get your money back if they're that unhappy with Groupon they need to quit advertising with Groupon. I am just amazed at how terrible the owner of this company is and they have been reported to Groupon.",1
3315,"Absolutely love this place. Pizza is always fresh and just like New York. I live far away so I am only able to come in around once every couple months, but the owner still seems to remember me every time I am in there and greets me by name! All the guys are super friendly. Would recommend this place to anyone that wants some real New York pizza.",5

3324,"Was meaning to check out this ramen shop in my neighborhood because we usually go downtown for our noodle fix. Looking at the photos and reading some great reviews, I was very excited (and obviously had high expectations); however, Touhenboku disappointed me. 

We ordered gyoza as an appetizer; I would skip these. When they came to the table, they looked delicious. After one bite, all I could taste was water; the meat filling was quite bland as well. They're frozen and just microwaved so the texture was rubbery. As my main, I ordered the ramen + donburi set. The garlic flavored ramen with 'thick' noodles was 'meh' for me; the menu raved about the strong garlic flavor and how it's a Touhenboku classic. I'm a huge fan of garlic and found my ramen to be underwhelming. For the donburi, I ordered the chicken karaage bowl. It was bland tasting fried chicken drenched with mayonnaise over plain rice. All in all, the one word that describes the food here - b l a n d.

We went for a late-ish Saturday lunch at around one o'clock. The restaurant was not too packed; there were maybe 2 or 3 other patrons so the staff:patron ratio was definitely in our favor. Anyway, the service was terrible. It was quite slow to begin with. Once finished our meals, we waited for our server to return because I wanted to order the mille feuille. I said 'excuse me' to one server; she saw me and just walked off. 'That's rude,' I thought, but I gave this person the benefit of the doubt. Another server passed by my table and again I said 'excuse me'. He saw me as our eyes met, but he too just walked off. Finally, another server came by after about an additional 10 minutes of waiting. In this time, we managed to stack all our plates and place them on the side of the table. The restaurant is quite small so it's not like we were hidden in a corner.

The food was 'meh' and the service was so bad that I don't think there's a reason for me to return.",1
3326,"131 Main is my favorite place to eat lunch when I'm in the Cornelius/Lake Norman area. I'm down there about once a month, so I go to 131 every change I get. I stick to their salads for the most part, and they are huge. The ""top chopped"" salad is fantastic. Their cobb salad with chicken is also very good. I had the shrimp and grits once and it tasted like it came straight out of the low country of South Carolina.  For dessert, the banana cream pie is simply outstanding! 

The service is as exceptional as the food. The servers seem to be highly trained and professional. I've never had any issues. Anything that needs to be fixed about the meal is addressed quickly. There is no doubt that this place is pricy, but in my view the service and the food are worth the money.",5
3328,"The only way I can get better food is if I fly to Atlanta and drive two hours to my mom's house. Not kidding. The breakfast options are limitless--and I've tried SO MANY. Their waffles and pancakes are light and fluffy, eggs always perfect and OMG at that gravy. It's almost exactly like my mom's gravy. I strayed from my normal breakfast orders today and got a burger and HOLY COW it was delicious too! And with a fried egg on top? Don't even get me started on the crepes. They are just perfection. Perfect amount of fruit inside, delightfully cooked. Guys, whoever makes your food is an incredible talent.

We take groups of 6-8 and everyone is always very impressed. Never had a complaint except when they brought the wrong dish to one person once. You will need reservations on weekends. Wait staff seems overly busy at times. I have seen Ben Roethlisberger eating here with large groups (family?). They have guys park your car because their lot is small and there is not much on the street. You won't go wrong with anything you order at this place. You can bring your own wine but they have a corkage fee.,5
3364,I had a shelac manicure here today. The older gentleman that started on my nails filed them to a point even though I repeatedly asked him to round them off. They are literally pointed at the tip like cat claws. Then he handed me off to another younger man that was wearing a mask and kept coughing directly at me. This man did not say a word to me. I asked him several questions and he did not speak to me. I know he spoke English because i heard him talking to others. I asked him to round the tips and he didn't. The shelac is already peeling off and the gel usually lasts me two weeks or more. I was not pleased with this manicure. I'm going to have to cut may nails and start over due to the pointed claws.,1

I had never seen Dr. Sams before, and I couldn't find any reviews, but his practice is close to my job. First of all, his practice is more like a shack on Ellsworth Ave. I had driven and walked by it many times, and I never would have guessed it was a business unless I saw there was a faded sign on it. When I got inside, it was dark, and Dr. Sams was standing behind the front desk window. I told him I had an appointment at 1, and since I was a new patient, I figured I had forms to fill out, so I got there about 15 minutes early. He began mumbling and what I gathered was that there was a problem and he couldn't see me. He also said he tried to call me, but I didn't have any missed calls or messages. He then said that his air conditioning wasn't working, and that was the problem. He (sort of) asked if we could reschedule, but wasn't very direct. I politely declined. Maybe he's a great dentist, but he's certainly very inconsiderate of his patient's time and his office lacks a friendly atmosphere.",1
3373,"First off let me start with I am a picky B!t@h!!  So, to let Kahea do my eyebrows was a HUGE step for me. I have been agonizing over getting them done for YEARS!!  I saw Kahea's work and LOVED it so I took the plunge!!  
I couldn't be HAPPIER!!

First her room is super adorable clean and organized.
We then went over paperwork. Which all of it is emailed to you which is perfect. It is nice to refer back for care and maintenance. Also less trees where used. 

 She took her time to consults with me and go over what I wanted and also what is best for my face shape. Then she drew in some eyebrows marked where they were to be lined up and we went through this process for at least a good 30-40 minutes. To make sure this is the shape I wanted. Tip: when the are drawn on much bigger looking than I though but when all said and done PERFECTION!!  

Next we did numbing cream and she went at it. It was a very strange sensation it's like a tattoo but not. I don't know how to describe it. I know I'm lame. But hey after about an hour of her Perfection. Yes BEAUTIFUL BROWS!! I'm so happy that I did it. They are healing beautifully!!

Thank you thank you Kahea I appreciate your time and professionalism!!",5
3374,"I was in town during the Holidays season so I went to get gel manicure and spa pedicure at The Nail Room. Kim, the nail tech gave me an amazing foot massage and my polish lasted for almost 3 weeks. I enjoy the friendly and nice service from everyone there and love the convenient location! I also feel safe and clean because they sanitize and spray everything after each client. I will definitely come back here again next time when I am in town and you should check out this place too!",5
3375,"Great service.  A little hard to find, but top notch customer support.  And unlike other places, fast and knowledgeable staff.  Highly recommend.",5
3378,"Long overdue review.  

This place would get 3 stars without serving anything.  A rather dark corner of my neighborhood has been transformed into a bright gathering place by the energy of this friendly, energetic young couple.  It's a testament to their efforts that I see crowds gather at an ice cream shop in the cold, grey depth of the Cleveland winter.

The actual product pushes Mason's over the top.  ""Grocery store grade"" ice creams beat you over the head with sweetness and flavorings.  Even some premium brands are rather intense.  THIS is the place to go if you want a true flavor experience.  After savoring pints of the Rising Star coffee and salted caramel, the thing that stands out most is the subtlety.  This is a premium product that caresses the taste buds with enticing, subtle hints of the featured ingredients on top of a solid base that is not cloyingly sweet.

Not cheap, but the ice cream equivalent of a meal prepared by a master chef.",5
3380,I started going to Body Tech just over a year ago. I love the personal attention and customized nutritional counseling that I get from these guys. What they do here is unique. The Bod Pod provides so much (accurate) information about your body composition it allows nutrition and fitness experts to truly customize a program- no gimmicks or quick fixes here. I work out with my trainer 3 days a week and have seen some pretty amazing changes in my physical ability. My husband and I just finished a 4 day hike on the Inca Trail! I would highly recommend checking out all these guys have to offer.,5

3388,"This place is amazing!! The atmosphere is very calm and relaxing, the staff is very sweet and helpful! The green tea is ammmaaazinnng. The food is so yummy!!! I got the mango green tea, the veggie sandwich, and garlic fries! Definitely going to come here so much more!!!!",5
3391,"My boyfriend and I decided on this location and restaurant because he'd never been there before and CLAIMS he doesn't like Italian food. Pah! So I picked this place to change his mind. My mom and I had lunch here a month before and it was delicious then. 

Not so much this time.

It was Valentine's day so we expected a wait, we aren't unreasonable. An hour and a half passed and people were seated that came in after us before the hostess noticed we had been there a while. Somehow we were overlooked,  but whatever. I'm starving and happy to be sat!! We were seated in a booth by the bar and didn't have a waitress proper. We had the super busy bartender who had little enough time to make drinks much less remember we needed drinks or silverware or ya know, any attention at all.  Again, can't blame her, it's valentine's day, crazy busy, they likely had callouts or something.

30 minutes later our order gets put in. 30 minutes later our appetizer comes out. Red flag should have been when I heard them 86 the mozzarella app we got. She brought out the appetizer, and just didn't mention how there was no mozz. I guess she figured we were new and didn't know any better. It was just this ricotta ish cheese and no mozz. Okay so the app was meh, main entrees yay! (An hour after putting the order in - dying of hunger lol) 

He ordered a pork dish and I had lobster ravioli. His would've been great BUT it was barely warm and tasted like it died in the window. 

My ravioli (5, don't order this if you're hungry), weren't even turned upright, which yknow whatever but what disappointed me is that it looked like they had dumped it off the tray they microwaved it in. And it tasted SO MICROWAVED. Mine wasn't hot either but I scarfed it down anyway. 

Definitely the worst meal and biggest waste of time I can say I've spent at a restaurant in a long time.",1
3392,This place is great! It's got great beer and bourbon selection. The food is terrific and our service was awesome as well. We will make sure to come back and visit,5
3393,"I had the same experience as Addison P.  I went here for restaurant week and the crab soup was bland, the shrimp were questionable, the Mac and cheese was bland, and my filet mignon was like a McDonald's burger. The asparagus were tasty as was the bread they served prior to the appetizer. My cheesecake dessert was good but it looked like something from the freezer from the grocery store and not something made in house. I was so excited to try this place after seeing the beautiful photos of food on their website but the food I was served look nothing like the photo of the same dish on the website. Won't be coming back even with all the coupons they gave me with my bill.",1
3394,We came in for a football game and decided we would stay here.I will never stay at a motel 6 again.,1
3395,"This is right across the street from my house and is my go to breakfast place now. I also live close to Hash House, Hash House a Go Go, and Babystakcs. Biscuits is my preferred place for the following reasons

-no wait- it is really large with lots of seating and I have never had to wait for a seat- waiting is for suckers
-good food to price ration- a breakfast is like 10 dollars and is more food than I can eat in one setting. Meals come with eggs, potatoes, and pancakes in addition to your main entree item. Its a solid deal


Everything I have gotten has been good, but here are a few favorites
-Brisket Benedict - this is a special that is only available sometime but if it is snatch it up
-Corned beef hash- made in house, is really good
-Country fried steak- one of my all time favorites and its good here- excellent gravy
-Southwest scramble- chorizo, avocado, salsa, served with tortillas- whats not to love 

Also, they have pretty good biscuits that come with an awesome seemingly fancy preserves that is great. Even if I don't get biscuits with my meal cause I want pancakes I usually order a side of biscuits.",5
3396,"Ok everyone knows the bread at this place is the shiznit.  I know it, and its the reason why I keep coming back.  However...

Today I met up with my sister for lunch here and I should have taken the way the employee treated us when I ordered our food, as a sign to get the fuck outta there.  She was giving us a dirty look, but I ignored it because shit, we all have bad days and thats what I thought she had.

We find a seat, get our drinks, and...wait.  10 minutes...20 minutes...30 minutes.  All of you mother fuckers who've been here know, they dont take 30 minutes to get you your food...maybe 5 minutes at most.  So anyway, a sandwich maker walked out and asked us if we got our food yet and I was like, yeah.  Obviously since we still have the number on our table.  She immediately brings us two slices of cake on the house.  Ok, thats nice, but I want my fucking food and Im on my lunch break, hello!  

We get our food and my sandwich wasnt what I ordered.  She said, ok I'll go make the right sandwich but you can keep this one.  I told her, I dont care at this point I just want to eat.  While we eat, we notice we didnt get our sides.  On top of that we didnt get utensils and they always give that to you when they bring the food.  

So my sandwich was brought out finally by the manager on duty Im assuming since he wore a different shirt.  I asked him, is there a reason why it took 30 minutes to get our food?  He looked shocked and went, Im assuming, to find out.  He never came back to our table to tell me.  

At this point Im like, I need to get back to work.  So I went to the register and asked the employee for a refund for the stupid sides we didnt get.  She was like, you didnt get your sides??  Whaat??  Im thinking, calm down bitch, just give me the fucking refund so I can get the fuck outta here.  She said the manager has to approve it.  Perfect =).  He gets there, asks me what the problem is.  Im looking at him like, are you fucking crazy?  I asked you earlier why it took 30 minutes to get our food and you went and hid!  So I told him I need a refund for the two sides we didnt get.  

He gives me the refund and some rice crispy treats and said sorry.  His excuse was, we've had a bad day its just been crazy.  Really dude?  Is that really your pathetic excuse for an answer?  I dont give a fuck if youre busy, what kind of system do you have where you forget to bring food to a table, especially when we have been sitting there with a number, visible to all the employees who are bringing food to everyone else.  
 
Ugh anyway, yeah, first time Ive ever experienced haters at this place, AND here in bootsy ass Charlotte.  It was obvious the workers didnt like us right when we walked in.  Yeah, we arent black or white like the majority of the people in this city, but daaamn, we arent animals!!  Backward ass city.  

And whats sad is the doormat of a manager couldnt do anything about it.  He didnt have the balls to go find out why it took 30 minutes to bring our food and come tell me.  Respect asshole, show some.

Love the bread, disappointed in the staff.",1

3400,"Bette Midler still has it. She did her shtick, cracked a few jokes, and sang all of her good songs. I really enjoyed the showgirls - from the dancing to the costumes - really made the show. I do have to say that the mermaid routine in the middle was a little ""huh?"" but again the costumes were divine. 

It is definitely an adult show and it was amusing watching the reactions of some of the older guys sitting around us. The show was an hour and a half with no intermission. 

We were in the 1st Mezzanine and the seats were good. The Coliseum is an excellent venue - very large, nice big stage, plush seats. They even have a bar so you can bring a drink in (note that the prices are way above your typical Vegas price).",5
3401,"They were efficient overall, friendly, competent and nice followup. They explained our air conditioning issue, came by earlier than initially scheduled because they were able to squeeze us in a day earlier, and then fixed the issue. No nonsense, on time. The only confusion on my part is that the scheduler said it was $40 for the initial visit to give an estimate but then charged $45. I didn't mention it but that was the only discrepancy. Had to refill our refrigerant due to a leak. I will definitely give them a call if I need them again.",5
3403,"Went to Songbird on a whim and absolutely loved it. My sister and I parked in the lot to the right when looking at the shop but I think there's parking in the back. It's a very cozy, hip, and quaint little coffee and tea shop. My sister ordered the Prickly Pear herbal tea and I ordered the mocha. Everything is made to order, which I appreciate but you do pay for it. For the two 16 ounce iced drinks, it was about $13. 

The tea was brewed to this beautiful color and flavor. It was a refreshing delight. 

The mocha was not your average chocolate coffee flavor. It had this smooth and medium thickness to it. I am not a huge coffee drinker but this mocha takes the gold. 

When I go to coffee shops, I order mochas because it's a specialty drink and how will I know if I have had the best if I don't try them all whenever I can. I appreciated the lady who works there too. She had long braids and was so nice and friendly. She was very personable and enjoyed talking about food. It was kind of hipster for my taste, but the drinks made up for it. I will definitely come back here.",5

The black dye that she put in my hair lasted longer than any other dye job I've had. I went to her in May, it is now August & my blowout is just barely beginning to wear off.

3425,"My husband and I came here after we eloped back in November. I'm not sure if it was the high of just getting married (and the bottle of champagne we had before), but this place was PERFECT.
We tried to eat at the steakhouse at The Cosmopolitan, but it was PACKED and the music was so loud we couldn't hear each other talk. 
So we went over to Paris and we didn't have to wait long. The service was awful. Pretentious (though not shocking) and stuck up. We wanted to sit by the window, but they said it was reserved. There were four empty table by the window, none of which filled up the whole time we were dining.

Nonetheless, we didn't let it kill the mood. We ordered a delicious bottle of pinot noir (I forget which) and ordered the blue cheese souffle. It was AWESOME. So light, yet incredibly flavorful at the same time. 

Dinner: I had the NY Steak with cranberry/bone marrow sauce on top. Seriously the best steak I've ever eaten in my life. It may have been the best meal I've ever had in my life. It was juicy and flavorful, perfectly cooked. My husband had a filet mignon with foie gras w/truffle oil. He raved about his meal too (I thought mine was better though).

All in all, the service got a dismal tip (my husband wrote a note on the receipt) but the meal was amazing and memorable!",5

3428,"I have never given 5 * rating, but Mora is amazing. We had reservations for 8:15, we were seated by 8:18 . Our server Kat was one of the best servers we have ever had, she timed everything we ordered just perfectly, she made sure our drinks were never empty and explained a of the food. As we had read other reviews saying not to miss the bread board we started there. Kat suggested we try the polenta and I'm so glad she did. It was the best I've ever had. Next we tried the fritters and the margarita Pizza. Pizza crust, sauce and cheese were yummy. The fritters were out of this world. Next came the roasted beets, chicken and the gnudi pasta. Omg the gnudi should not be missed. Finally we listened to Chris who told us we had to try the raspberry sundae. I'm forever grateful to him this was beyond wonderful. My husband thought coconut cake was great but then he tried mine and he was blown away. Ask for Kat if you can she will not disappoint.",5
3431,"I've ordered from them before,  and I have never been disappointed. And this time they knocked it out of the park. Such a good breakfast, egg whites with tomato, spinach, cheese, and a side of toast and potatoes with an orange juice.  They deliver Breakfast poeple. Yumm.",5
3432,You really gotto try here!,5

The location is tucked away, but easy enough to find (thank you GPS). When I walked in, my first thought was ""tranquil"". The waiting area smelled nice, was comfortable, and decorated like a spa should be. 
The facial was phenomenal! Products felt and smelled great! Jeanette is amazing--very relaxed, friendly, makes you feel welcome, and is VERY good at her job. Really didn't want to leave... 
Thanks to Groupon, what a great find! Will definitely be going back!!",5
3435,"I have been here since the 1st week they opened... I've  had a few different itmes on thier menu and have yet to be disappointed.  I have to say the orange chicken has been better than china a go go and panda express.  Its so much more flavorful and the chickwn chunks are meatier, less breading. The won ton soup has plenty of won tons.  Kung pao chicken is super delicious.  Thier chicken curry is definitely one of my faves. Chicken chow mein is way more yummier also. Salt and pepper pork chops were a bit hit ! I hope it stays here ,its close to home.  The owner is always super nice and the employees too .",5
3437,"Pastel colours, lots of old people, the suburbs.

Have you accidentally wandered into a retirement home? No, you've just set foot inside The Little Chef.

Located inside a strip mall, The Little Chef personifies what a neighborhood family restaurant should be.

Plenty of seating of both the table and booth variety. The space is open and airy, you'll never feel crammed in beside the folks next to you.

In terms of food, The Little Chef is a comfort food lover's dream. Soups, sandwiches, meat pies (eat in or take home frozen) multiple types of burgers, pastas and even the odd more adventurous item like a Thai stir fry or lamb.

This isn't to say any of the food is bland. Far from it.

The day we stopped by for lunch I had the ""threesome"", a spinach salad, tuna melt and tart of the day while the lady had a large soup of the day (potato leek) and a fish burger with salad.

The soup arrived in a large bowl and we both enjoyed the chunks of vegetables floating in the hearty broth.

Our mains arrived and the tuna melt was served on an english muffin with sharp cheddar melted over the tuna/scallion/celery filling. So far as tuna melts go, this was in my top 5. The spinach salad had fresh spinach, hard boiled eggs and a zippy vinaigrette. 

The fish burger was a halibut patty which was crisp and lightly breaded. Some home made tartar sauce on the side was a nice touch.

The tart of the day was banana cream and it was creamy and rich. But not cloyingly super-sweet, which is too often the downfall of desserts like this. 

I've never seen an empty room at The Little Chef regardless of time of day. There's always a table with young children, families of multiple generations or seniors who have been married longer than I've been alive out for a nice meal.

This is definitely one of the ""safer"" choices you could pick for dining in Calgary. However, if you're faced with a group of differing ages and pallets, The Little Chef will provide something for everyone.",5
3438,"Shared the combo for two. So much food and it was all great. The shish kabob ordered medium rare was probably the standout. Topped with tzatziki it was phenomenal. $25 and it easily fed my wife and I with leftovers. Server was very nice and attentive. 

Atmosphere is super interesting. The building seemed to be a diner before, which I feel like made the whole experience more authentic. You can tell it was a small business working with what they could find and focusing on a good product.

They also have a deal for a gyro or other sandwich with a side and drink for about $8. If it is anything like the food we had it is definitely worth stopping in on your lunch break for that deal.",5

So, this was my second visit.  I went with about 8 others.  And one of my friends, asked them to grill the crab!  So I followed suit!  OMG!  If they ain't grilled, I don't want it!  Lordie, lordie lordie!  They slapped some butter on it, while it was on the grill, then some seasonings!  OMG!  This was the best freakin crab I've ever had in my life!  So since this was my second time, all I wanted was the Salad wedge and some pansit.    I think we had at least 5 glasses of wine, and they would have kept it coming, and we would have kept drinking it, but we had to go to  our next spot.

We've been thinking to stay at another hotel, but I'm glad we've stayed at Wynn. Check their website for more info regarding their rooms. we stayed at the Parlor Suite (Wynn Tower). Check their website, those rooms are gorgeous.

Will do a separate review on their AMAZING restaurant (I'm in love with one of them even though I've been to a few).",5
3467,"Dorrenda is the best! We had a graduation party, Dorrenda came over and set up all the food, managed the bar, and cleaned the kitchen! The food was excellent! Everyone raved about the food and Dorrenda couldn't have been more personable. We will definitely be using Dorrenda again!",5
3469,"Marko was awesome! I was super impressed by his professionalism and friendliness. I had a lot of questions about switching my auto insurance agency, all of which he answered. He even got me a quote the same day, which saved me a TON of money as my insurance price was about to increase. He was incredibly prompt with his responses and made everything easy to understand, which was a relief as I am not very knowledgeable about insurance. Could not ask for better service. I will definitely recommend him to my friends and family!",5
3470,I'm so glad that I have a chopt closer to me now. So I went over today and the new store is beautiful. I love the decor of this location. The quality of the food was consistent with the others.  I ordered something new and I didn't enjoy it as much as my usual but that's a personal choice. I had no complaints simply love this place.,5
3471,"I had been wanting to go to Haberdish since I first moved to Charlotte! I had read such great reviews and wanted to try things out for myself! I got the chicken tenders which were huge, so I could only eat 2! I also got the small size of the charred okra which was probably my favorite part of the meal. You have to get the bacon jam on top! I also ordered the Mac and cheese with the spicy chicken skins on top! The Macaroni was very good but the chicken skins definitely bring some heat to the dish so be aware of that! The small size of the sides is definitely enough to feed 2-3 people depending on how hungry you are and the tenders are big so 2 were plenty! I also got a biscuit to go with the meal and it came with their sweet tea butter which was fantastic. I would highly recommend this place and I can't wait to go back! Next time I want to go for brunch! I follow them on Instagram which makes my mouth water every time they post a picture!",5
3472,"I have been taking my 2013 zx6r to Preston at TurnSocket since I bought the bike and they do an amazing job!!!  From changing the exhaust to doing routine chain maintenance, they provide excellent service at an amazing price.",5
3474,"First time here and it's so loud you have to yell across the table if you want to talk also you can't hear the waitress and they can't hear you very poor atmosphere, probably will not come back I don't like that I have to yell just to talk at dinner. Very disappointed for my first time here.",1
3476,"Saw this place on the internet via facebook so we ventured out of our area and found.. Loved it.  It is the experience that makes this place so fun.. I had a custom creation.. I was the first person to put the flavors & add ins together.. I chose the Chocolate cream , peanut butter & potato chips add ins.. To watch them take liquid cream and pour it onto a cold surface.. Then mix in my 2 add ins, the peanut butter& potato chips, they chopped and mixed and then smoothed it thinly out and then rolled it into these cute rolls.. Then they placed the rolled ice cream in a cup and topped mine with extra potato chips.. My husband had the Donut & coffee creation.. Very fun experience..",5
3477,"We have ordered on under eats and have had the same issues over and over with dim sum king. All we want is some extra hot sauce for our $50-60 food order. That's it!!! They NEVER give it even though we put it in the special request box. Called and complained after the 3rd time not getting the requested hot sauce and they said that the cook guys don't look at the special request boxes - ok??..... anyhow boss guy said to call after ordering from Uber eats and let them know directly of any special request. Ok will do. A bit inconvenient, but whatever (we really like their hot sauce). Long story short, just got my order and you guessed it- NO EXTRA HOT SAUCE (just half of the smallest sauce containers out there- they couldn't even fill the 1 hot sauce container 3/4) and this is WITH the reminder call. Anyhow, we're ready to call it quits with restaurants who do not respect their frequent and loyal customers. Truth be told, we only like this place because of the shrimp/chives pucks. Everything else is not as tasty as Rol SAN. 

They apologized and gave us a credit on our next order.",1
3481,"I have been to see Amy for a pedicure a few times now, and just had to write a review after I saw her yesterday.  Overall, I love the experience- the pedicure is a little more, being at a spa, but to me is totally worth the spa experience...  and the brownies!

It's a full hour, and I always see Amy b/c I just like her so much!  She is very friendly and so sweet, and does a great job.  She makes me feel totally pampered and my nails look great when I'm done.  I look forward to it every time!",5
3482,These people promote you to buy into their timeshare if you attend a 90 min presentation they promised 100.00 in chips. Well my fianc√© and I never got the 100.00 chips and we were stuck in this presentation from 12am to 330pm and then told that they wasn't giving us the $100 chip. They bamboozled us and when we got to the room the bathroom had mold in the tub. I WOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT recommend this hotel to anyone.,1
3483,"Now Chris G. wrote a review for the FOOD at the Cabana at The Wynn... I am afraid not, but I guess thats what some people look for when they're in Vegas... not me.

I am not going to lie. I had a lot of resistance at first from my cousin when she heard that you coud not only GAMBLE at the Cabana pool at  The Wynn, but that girls also had the option of being TOPLESS. Ok not so bad. For starters, not EVERY girl is topless, and its topless in the sense of a European resort vaction NOT spring break.

(I will admit there was one tiny girl with triple D's and thong... but its Vegas and all in fun).

The best part too, no kids. Who doesnt love getting splashed right?

The environemnt is super chill and everyone's so friendly. I love how they have a dj and play cool music, but at the same time is more of your alternative to the crazy ""spring break"" esque scene at Tao Beach and Rehab.

I will definitely go back to The Wynn and one of my my stops will definitely be the pool!",5
3485,"Love this place; it's always a great experience. Ordered fish tacos and some bubbly the last time I visited for a celebratory lunch. Highly recommend sitting on the outside patio facing the water- especially during sunset. Fantastic views. Yummy food. And solid drink menu. Unfortunately, I don't remember what ros√© or champagne I ordered; however, it was tasty. I've had mixed drinks there too, and they always manage to go down nicely & fairly quickly #perusual I def recommend this place to those who haven't experienced this beautiful venue.",5
3486,"As far as chain hotels go, this one is great. It's a signature property from Starwood.  They redid the old Sahara.  They are currently turning one of their towers into a separate property; the W.  Easy check in for me.  Platinum elite.  Got some drink vouchers.  Got the resort fees knocked off.  Monkey bar is great. The signature drink is awesome.  Drank for free there with all the vouchers they gave myself and my colleague (he's lifetime platinum). We hit the casino for some beers and watched World Series game 7.  Ended up at Unami for a burger later.  The diner in the SLS is nice too.  They need to offer the full menu throughout the day.  My room was great. Got an upgrade.  Nice spa too. Plenty of cardio machines.  I will be back.",5
3487,"Holy Villa! 

Tucked away amongst the boulders (harhar), I stayed in a 3br/3bath villa a few weeks back (complete with a full kitchen, 2 living rooms, dining room, back patio with full grill, laundry room with a washer/dryer and 2 car garage - just to name a few of the amenities) and lord god almighty - this resort has hands down been one of the best Waldorf Astoria Collections I've had the priviledge of staying in. 

All the rooms were emaculate, the SW decor was indescribably detailed in every single corner of each bedroom/living room/sitting room/kitchen and overall, the grounds were simply breathtaking; so quiet and peaceful.

My experience at the Golden Door Spa was also tranquil and pure bliss. 

My one small miniscule gripe is the ""no street lamp"" law. There are hogs and coyotes out there!!! Show me the lights!!! 

Wait, one more gripe. The in-room dining service could use some work. Calling for breakfast at 8am had a 1+ hour wait everyday that I was there (6 days, 5 nights) and the dinner in-room menu was MEHHHH. You're better off trekking over to the restaurant in the lodge instead.",5
3488,Great food and reasonable pricing. Extremely friendly staff. Highly recommend this place.,5
3490,"Shanice is the absolute best! She's so sweet, understand and genuine. The lashes she did on me was amazing! She recently saved me from an eyelash extensions nightmare from another salon (armis salon and spa -- do not ever go there). She worked me into her schedule and helped save my natural lashes from the lady who completely botched them. Shanice's price are very competitive. You can defiantly tell she loves her job.",5
3493,"Pretty good food, horrible service. We reserved early for 130, they tried to make us wait till 330. So as we were dining, no refills on water were picking up. The waitress named Vanessa treated us like shit. She served us a dessert that had wax paper from the baking still inside. When we informed her of the situation she was very passive aggressive and took the plate and then had us pay gratuity! Which gratuity is only supposed to be those paying  with a group of 6 people or higher and they're having us pay more than usual. Wanna feel like you're unwanted here the moment you get there? That's the place to be.",1
3494,"XS is located at the Wynn, which currently still has free parking, and it is one of the most elegant Night Clubs in Vegas. The DJ is between an inside dance floor and an outside pool area -- truly making it the best of both worlds. I recently came back to XS recently and I noticed many improvements so I decided it was time to update my review. 

A special shout out to my promoter Edward (ig: modern_edd) who put me on the guest list for Friday night with Diplo. Since we were all girls, we were able to get quite an express entrance, entering before most of the people who bought general admission tickets. 

We entered from the pool area and the view was stunning. There was lights across the top from the sides leading to the central bar area that even has casino tables now. There was also the addition of seating areas for the girls to sit around on. Security was also more relaxed because before they would yell at you to get up and move if you are sitting around a non table-service area. This definitely makes XS a more friendly place for the ladies to come, dance and rest a bit cause high heels are painful. My friend and I were lucky to come in while it was not too busy yet so we took plenty of pictures with the bar area, pool and lights in the background. It was beautiful.

While hanging by the bar area we received some drinks. My friend had the Long Beach ($20) which is a Long Island with a splash of cranberry juice instead of a splash of coke cause pink drinks are better looking than brown drinks and I had an Adios ($20) my go-to blue drink that is also lovely in pictures. 

After some light chit chat we finished out drinks and entered the main dance floor inside. My rule is to go deep enough into the dance floor that you are not near the entrance. If you stay by the entrance, all of the people trying to go in and out will push through you. My girl and I found a great spot and it was all positive vibes and fist bumps from there. 

Once it got hot and stuffy inside, we went back outside for some fresh air. I love having the option to go in and out as I please and I truly feel like that is one of the best things about XS that has it maintaining its' reputation as one of the top clubs in Vegas even as other clubs like Marquee and Tao has slipped the test of time. Don't get me wrong... Omnia is still my favorite... but XS has a secure spot for 2nd :)",5
3496,"OMG. Hands down the BEST New York style pizza in the valley! I drive down from North Scottsdale just to get a slice from time to time. It tastes even more amazing after a night at the Maya. Wow, just wow. My mouth is salivating as I am writing this review!!!!! The sauce is garlicky (which I LOVE!) and it folds perfectly in your mouth. A little on the greasy side (your stomach may be mad at you later), but I don't care. Tastes so good going down it's worth it. Thanks Joe's for fulfilling my NY pizza cravings!",5
3498,"Ordered for pickup. Fast, quakity ,great food no issues. Excellent customer service! Highly recommend the tomato soup, steak and cheddar panini, and crumbly blue cheese salad.",5
3500,"This is it. If you're looking for a new dental clinic or wanting to switch to a new one, Archer Dental is the final answer to your search.
I've always been AFRAID to go to the dentists and thus all my cleanings in the past years have huge gap between each one. What's worse is that every single time was a painful process. So the year is coming to an end and I've been paying for my benefits so I thought not to waste any money and get it done. Archer Dental was able to fit me in right away and was very friendly over the phone to explain all the details about their pricing and going over with me of what my insurance would and would not cover. 
On the appointment day, the hygienist was very thorough on explaining each step of the way during the exam as well as the cleaning process. She offered a warm lavender pillow to go behind my neck and another pillow goes around the neck that shaped like a ""U"" to make sure that I was all comfortable. Most importantly, she offered me num gels before she started the cleaning since I had zero pain tolerance and it's been a long while since I had my last one done. The whole time she'd made sure that I was okay and she continued to make convo so that I was distracted from the cleaning. On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the most painful), I would say in my experience with Archer Dental, it's 3. Of course at some point it was quite painful, but for the most part, it's nothing. This wonderful experience is almost like a gift from santa and I am looking forward to my next appointment already.
I give this dental clinic a 10 out of 10 rating! The whole environment is very friendly and welcoming. Look no more, give this one a try and you won't regret!!

ps. this is my first yelp review, it's a great experience not to share.",5
3501,"I went for dinner on a birthday weekend. Wasn't too busy but they had a 75% capacity. Andi, the server was spectacular...she was patient, funny, kind, and had an amazing personality....even if the food hadn't been fantastic, she would have made the meal Awesome...btw the prime rib.... scrumptious...

I'll definitely go back and ask for Andi !!!!",5
3502,Excellent pulled BBQ sandwich.  Nice atmosphere.  The gumbo is great for this area.  Staff was attentive and courteous.,5
3504,"Tried this place after seeing it on Yelp. Head towards the back of the casino and go up the escalator to Toby Keith's bar to find it. Tried the green grape ice cream with strawberries, raspberries and mango. Delicious! Guy taking the orders was hilarious and had tons of energy. Possibly the owner? Recommended for anyone wanting something sweet without a bunch of sugar.",5
3505,"I love this place! We finally returned after waiting for the spring training visitors to leave, and while there was still a wait it was a short 15 minute wait time for the 2 of us. 
The hostesses do a great job and always have it together. They're always courteous, and just like everyone else there they work hard.
We sat inside as it was first available, which was more than fine. The inside was full, however it wasn't extremely loud like some places get. We always get our food right away and always without mistakes. 
I got the Santa fe scrammle which is always good. The serving size says two eggs but it's a huge portion! I like Butter's giving you the choice of fruit, grits, or hash browns, while still giving you the  next choice of pancakes or toast. (when you get an omelette or scrambler) I also added zucchini and peppers to my dish and it was only a $0.25 up charge for each. 

My bf got the two eggs, with fruit and bacon as a protein. he also got a short stack of blueberry pancakes. The pieces of bacon are a good size,eggs were scrambled perfectly, and he loves the pancakes every time. 
The prices are very reasonable and the servers and bus staff are very attentive. 

Thank you Butter's staff so much for letting me wake up and know I have a place for breakfast I can go that won't disappoint.",5
3507,"I had never heard of this place before although I've spent time in Garrison Woods (just south of Marda Loop), most notably across the street at the Starbucks, but I met a few friends for dinner here (one of them chose this place).

We had resos for 4:45 and we were the only people there. By the time we left at 6:30, it was almost full. So I would recommend calling ahead to reserve for sure..

What I really liked about the place was our waitress was very personable. She went through the chef's special, was easy to talk to (didn't feel like she was trying to be nice) and she was dressed very formally. I don't go to a restaurant to look at the waitresses so it was nice that she wasn't showing a lot of leg or cleavage.

She was very prompt in bringing out our drinks, the bread and taking our orders. She knew the menu really well, as we had questions about some of the entrees and she was able to answer them easily.

The food itself was delicious (I ordered the seafood pasta) which was a large portion, but it was ok since I was really hungry :)

Our waitress (notice I'm not saying her name - she never introduced herself to me and I neglected to ask) was great throughout the meal, topping up our drinks and seeing if we needed anything. She wasn't overbearing though, so just the right amount.

I would highly recommend going here if you live anywhere close to Garrison Woods. I highly enjoyed the food :)",5
3508,"These guys are the best movers, hands down! They are pros at packing and super fast. They can pack and move ANYTHING! I was amazed at how quickly they wrapped our furniture and loaded it into and off of the truck. I highly recommend their service. Call Kevin for a quote. He won't try to sell you anything you don't want and gives you tips on how to save money, if you're interested. They may cost a few dollars more than the competition, but we'll worth it!",5
3512,"Best patio?!? lgNo!! Over priced, small portions (which match the tiny space review...)No pkg...nothing tasty bout that...ps nice clock lol",1
3513,This place is awesome .  Although the place looks older the food is great and the employees are friendly. The lunch specials run around $5.00 and that was with a soda! I will post some pictures during my next visit.  If your looking for some good Chinese and are in the area stop in.,5
3514,"Went there for my Dad's birthday because they are supposed to be the ""Birthday"" place to eat....?   We were there at 6 pm on a Thursday and were pretty much the only diners in the place.  Waited at least 40 minutes for the 4 of us to get our food.    
Food was ok, but wtf, did they have to kill the cow to make it????!   I can see why the place was dead as far as business.  I've heard the owner is moving on....   Maybe will be better then, as of now, would not go back....",1
3515,"We had a wonderful dinner on the beautiful patio. The service was perfect! We know our server was extremely busy but despite how many tables he had, he answered every menu question we had and was very accurate on the wine descriptions, all while making us feel that we were his only table and main focus. I love the menu and had a hard time decided between the many selections. We decided on the Tuna, Sea Bass and Pasta special. All were excellent dishes but my favorite was the Tuna. Seared perfectly rare, it was a great choice for a hot summer evening.",5
3516,"This was one of my favorite meals during our week-long Vegas trip. 
We stayed in the Jockey Club, which is connected to the Cosmopolitan, so the majority of our meals took place in there because they have a lot of decent restaurants. 
I had this place bookmarked in the weeks leading up to the trip, but I didn't really pay attention to where exactly it was on the strip. I also hadn't planned well for the weather, and brought mostly black dresses. 
Well, this place is located in the Venetian. If you don't know how far the Venetian is from the Cosmopolitan, just imagine how long the strip is, then imagine walking about half of the strip, just for lunch, with one person in your party wearing a black dress and the other wearing a dress suit and pants. This is during summer, when the high reaches nearly 110 degrees during the day. Yes, my boyfriend loves me very much to be dealing with this sort of thing.
We finally arrived and noticed the interesting decor, which was not traditional at all. We knew this was a fusion restaurant, but we were starting to worry that the food wouldn't be as good as advertised.
Luckily, our worries were put to rest after receiving the appetizer we ordered, which were gyoza with kombucha paste filling. They were tangy, and if dipped into the sauce, salty. Very delightful...I would recommend to every customer.
Next the manager came over and talked with us for a bit before recommending the sea bass skewers with Peruvian corn. We hesitated a bit, because we wanted sushi for lunch on account of our plans for a buffet at dinner, but he insisted that it was a plate that shouldn't be overlooked, so we got it.
Soon after, he returned with complimentary ceviche tacos, as a gift for buying so much food (we also got a special roll each and a roll to share)! Quite a lot of food for a meal we wanted to be light.
The tacos were decent, I'd say 3/5 stars. Interesting to try, but I wouldn't say I'd order them if I return. The skewers, however, were 5/5. The corn was huge and chewy, while the skewers were well-flavored and -cooked, and unbelievably tender. I am immensely grateful that the manager suggested these, as it was one of the most unique dishes I've ever had. I would recommend these to any customer, as well.
I didn't try my boyfriend's roll, because I don't like shrimp in my sushi, but my roll was pretty good. I wanted their Samba roll, but settled for the Maine lobster roll. It may be difficult to believe, but I thought there was a little too much lobster on the roll (don't hurt me)!
We split a basic salmon avocado roll, which was average. 
It ended up being a lot of food in general, but a lot more than we expected to get. 
If you love food, especially sushi, and you love trying new things, do not come here expecting a light meal. You will eat a lot and leave pleasantly full, but be unable to eat your next meal!",5
3517,"Recently bought a laptop from this store... also bought a setup package to $100.  Total spend just under $1000.00  

Setup was lousy... took the laptop home and it was not working... wifi issue... I have a number of other electronics that use wi-fi in the house that had no issues, just this brand new laptop.  Took the laptop back to the store... the geeksquad looked at it said... it is your internet connection at home... you need to go home an reboot... so off I go back home reboot... and laptop wi-fi continues to drop (not work)... again next day took back to the store and was told we redo the setup... another day later, took the lap top hold and again.... worked better but not to the specifications as provided by the manufacturer... took the laptop back to the store... they replaced ... took the new laptop back home and ... laptop does not even connect via Ethernet and wi-if definitely does not connect... again took the laptop back...was offered to get another brand... yet there was no other brand that would be equivalent to what I was looking for... asked for full refund... was told no refund on the service which they were now telling me was $149.00.

Refused and argued for over 2 hours eventually the store clerk realized that I should not be charge $149.99 after I had to take pen to paper... they wanted to over charged me...

In reality they service they provided was not worth the $100 or $149.  I should have been provided full refund but was told they do not refund labour.   DO NOT SHOP HERE ... they will get you.

They kept trying thorought the last 2 weeks to sell me the extended warranty... so they knew there was problems with the laptop yet continued to sell to customers.... not reputable...

Buyer be ware... Future shop... not a company you can trust nor should you spend your money... I lost $100 but they have now gained a reputation that shows them as being sharks.....",1
3518,This location is horrible.. the management is very rude.. I ordered a chili cheese dog and i was very disappointed. I felt cheated. I received a penny sized amount of chili on my hot dog and no cheese when they even charged me extra for cheese!!! I showed it to the manager who seemed to be a lady of Mexican decent... she didn't even care. She basically said too bad and wouldn't refund my money... not even replace it with the correct item I ordered!!!! Horrible customer service! The only good thing about it was the restrooms were surprisingly pretty clean... maybe they make their employees complete a training course in cleaning restrooms instead of how to make a damn hot dog!! I will NEVER return to this location. Don't be cheating your customers!! I asked for a side a of jalape√±os and they only gave me four AND charged me extra!!!,1

But after meeting the friendly staff and served promptly, our experience started turning around. My wife ordered the frosted flakes encrusted French toast (AMAZING!!!). I ordered the burrito with chicken fried steak, eggs, cheese, potatoes, & smothered with gravy. It was delicious ... Definitely will return back and refer to friends and family.",5
3525,"I've been to this salon 3 times. My first experience was great. I had Victoria who gave me a wash, a trim and offered to blow dry my hair straight. Total came out to $15. My second time was with Carmecita, who specializes in curly hair which I have. She was so sweet. She also gave my hair a wash, a trim, but no drying. Total was $40 which did catch me off guard. Third time is the reason I will not be going back. I had Cyndi. She gave me a trim,blow dried my hair straight and used a straighter..which I don't get why. Victoria didn't need one. Anyways no wash was included because I had already washed my hair. The total came out to $60. Which is ridiculous. I didn't have any special work done. I've always asked for the same thing. How does it go from $15-$60??? I feel prices need to be discussed ahead of time because it's just absolutely ridiculous. Moving on. I have my hair trimmed into a V versus straight across. Cyndi completely gave me something else. Which is shown in the pics. This was just plain horrible. When we were done I didn't notice it because obviously I can only see so much from my viewpoint but once I got home my family instantly noticed it. And I had an event that day. I was so upset. I hate getting a trim in general because I like my hair long. So because Cyndi messed up I had to get it cut TWICE. My hair is so short now and I hate it. All thanks to Cyndi who should've just flat out said she had no experience in doing a V cut. I then proceeded to call Kara,the shop owner. She apologized and said she'd be able to fix it Wednesday(this happened on Saturday). You must be crazy if you think I'm gonna walk around with choppy hair for 4 days! Client satisfaction is definitely not a priority at this salon. I was refunded but a refund can't fix how short my hair is now. For the sake of your hair, don't go here. 




Update: Words are being thrown left and right here.  Cyndi never said those words. Why would I go back to her to redo my hair? I'd run the risk of leaving with a bob. Point being. Pictures speak for themselves",1

3534,"Waited 30 minutes to sit after being told it would be 10 minutes for a full gel set. Waited an HOUR after being sat, in which time a tech was going to help me but then realized I wanted something she couldn't do...so the waiting continued. Started to consider just doing them myself at home, but FINALLY got waited on. How this place has such a high rating I will never know. Was accused of not telling the girl at the front what I wanted although I MADE sure to considering this isn't my first visit to a salon. The nails are crooked, with thick gel, uneven, feels like the dremel burned my natural nails and the tips have gaps between them and my real nails. I was then charged more than advertised! Even the polish is uneven. Now I wish I would have left and followed my instincts to do them myself.",1
3535,"Modern, well designed, and loved it.

It reminded me a lot of Marlins Stadium in Miami, due to the modern vibe it has.  And it is much better than American Airlines Arena in Miami, which is great.

Can't wait to go to another concert and for our hockey team...yeah, need to learn the rules.",5
3536,Good place to get manicures. My visit there i had a short wait to get help. My manicurist was quick and precise in getting rid of the excess skin around my nails.,5
3539,If you really care about your pets. Love them more than anything then this is where you come when their health is on the ropes. The staff here is second to none. The Cedar Sinai of pet hospitals in Las Vegas. You need a primary referral first as this place is for medical procedures far and beyond a tick bite. My dog had spinal surgery done here and they fixed him up good. $7k later. Rehab and all ready for another 50k miles. Saying thanks and a 5er yelp review does no justice for these guys. Keep up the good work.,5
3540,I came to get a pedicure and specifically asked if they could cut any of my ingrown toe nails because they were hurting me and they didn't whatsoever cut them. Cutting ingrown toe nails out the correct way is what they learn in training and she totally had no idea what she was doing. When she cut my toe nails they were all crooked and the worker was being super rough. Pedicures are one of the most simplest jobs to do at nail salons and this was the first time i've ever been unsatisfied with getting a pedicure. I will never get a pedicure here again.,1
3541,"Zero Rate! Waste of money, they rush their work. Don't come here! Im so Disappointed with their work done",1
3542,"If you're shopping for a veterinarian, please read this. If I could give zero stars I would. This doctor has been in practice for 43yrs. You would think as such, he would be passionate about helping animals. And maybe he does love our pets however, his approach to veterinary medicine is severely outdated. This DVM did not give my pet pain meds after he removed a portion of a tumor. I received absolutely no post operative instructions when I picked my pet up. There was no follow up call the next day after my pets surgical procedure. Upon requesting the biopsy results a week later, the doctor had the receptionist tell me my pet had cancer. I was informed he was too busy with surgery that day to give me his results himself. When asked what type of tumor it was, the receptionist advised me he didn't know and that the doctor doesn't normally tell owners what type of tumor.  I recently left the veterinary industry after working in it over a decade.  This doctor has clearly ""checked out"" after his 43yrs. 
I imagine his positive reviews are due to his low prices. His prices are low for a reason. Do not let that fool you. I hope that in your search for a veterinarian you read this and steer clear of this practice. Make sure that when your pet goes under anesthesia you find out that the doctor is going to follow best practices including administering IV fluids and pain medications. Make sure no corners are going to be cut. Good luck in your search...there are many great veterinarians out there. Do not decide on cost alone. Ask questions!",1
3543,"In for the weekend, found on yelp. Great vibe, good music, great service. The food was awesome. Simple menue, easy to read lots of good choices to choose from. Good presentation and the food tasted better than it looked! Would recommend to anyone.",5
3544,"After living in San Diego for a few years, I was in desperate need of an authentic TJ Style taco, and I have found it here! They serve traditional street style tacos with all your typical toppings. If they man working there tells you a salsa is hot, take his recommendation and don't pour it all over your taco, because chances are, it's really freaking hot!
I recommend beef tongue if they have it, but if not, chicken is my second choice. 

No other Pittsburgh taco place compares to Las Palmas for me! 

The tacos are $2.50 and 2 will fill me up. (Cash Only for tacos, cards inside the store)",5
3546,Mt Everest is my go to place for Indian. I've only been here during lunch for the buffet. It's $11.99. I absolutely love the chili chicken! Curry chicken and Tikka Masala are very good also. The buffet has about 8-10 dishes along with fruit and salad. They bring buttered Naan to your table. The decor isn't much to look at but that really doesn't matter to me. I LOVE this place and if they ever closed down I would be heartbroken!,5
3549,Best BBQ I've had so far. Great hospitality chef Tim and chef Will. Got the 5 meat special with 3 sides . Good for 2-3 people,5
3550,Jain came to perform my pest control service as I was working from home today.  Since I am not usually home I asked him to do the inside as well.  Juan was pleasant and polite and did a fine job.  Hats off to Aptive and Juan.  Thank you!,5
3553,"Great Job!  
I was looking for a new tree service.  After reading all the great reviews about Treewise, I gave them a call.  I was very impressed with Howard.  He has a great deal of knowledge regarding the trees and foliage in our yard.  He also has  great customer service!  They came out and did a wonderful job taking care of all the needs of the yard. 
After just a couple of weeks of having them work, we went out of the country for  vacation.  A monsoon hit and did some major damage to several trees in our yard.  I called Howard to see if they would go to the house and take care of it.  He was there within one day. Took pictures of all the damage and took care of everything!  Howard and his team did an amazing job cleaning up the yard.  I would definitely refer him to my family and friends!",5
3556,Hubby and I were in search of something good in the area and yelped nearby restaurants.  Sushi Queen came up and had great reviews.  We thought to give it a try - we ordered takeout.  My hubby picked up the food and shared that the ladies working (owners) were very pleasant to chat with during his wait.  The order time was fair - 15 minutes because we had a last minute sushi order.  The food is yummy - we ordered hibachi.  The food was hot and not overcooked.  The meats were tender - hubby ordered  - steak hibachi and commented that it was tender.  We are excited they at so near as we normally travel to Charlotte for hibachi.  Now we have a place near home.  I highly recommend!,5
3558,"We had great service!!! And our food was totally awesome, we wish we had come here before!!",5
3560,"This place redefines the meaning of ""small"". I watched and marveled as they were constructing my ""small"" chicken shawarma meal. It was packed to the brim and that was before any of the generously portioned chicken was placed on top. It wouldn't matter as much if the taste wasn't up to par but that's not the case here. The flavours all worked together without anything being too distinct and distracting. It's a far walk from my workplace but it's a walk that I'll look forward to making again very soon.",5
3563,I took my entire family to this restaurant for the first time and as soon as we walked in a fat and lazy hostes girl made us to wait for a table for about 10 minutes the restaurant was pretty empty then we finally got a table and waited about 15 minutes for a glad of water and menus with a bad actitud I almost took my family to another restaurant but I didn't want to drive another 20 minutes so we ordered food took about 40 minutes to get it oh by the way the restaurant was empty but 3 tables that is embarrassing so anyway never coming back to this place.,1
3564,"Great food and desserts as always. Had thai chicken wrap and avocado egg rolls to start. For dinner my family had garlic pasta with shrimp, bang bang chicken/shrimp and chicken bellagio. All very good and huge portions, so leftovers for lunch tmw. For dessert Carmel cheese cake and tiramisu. Great meal :-)",5

3567,"Perfect Home Products (PHP) guttered the front of my two-story home in Club Aliante' ... super fair price ... quality product ... outstanding workmanship ... installation was super fast and efficient.  Office staff was always very friendly and their communication with me was outstanding.  Our home was recently repainted and had stone veneer added to multiple areas.  PHP gladly returned and re-bent and reinstalled two (2) downspouts which were removed during the painting and veneer installation.  Overall, we couldn't be happier with the service we've consistently received from PHP.",5
3568,Love this place....service style and fare all top notch....toronto needs more of this.,5
3569,Great customer service . I never empty my drink. They  always refill my drink. They always check back at us to make sure we are ok. Food is excellent. My favorite is fried whole red snapper. Dipping sauce is delicious.  Fried ice cream is good too. They put peanut in. The only problem is so hard to find parking because they always busy.,5
3571,"I felt really ripped off. I paid almost 5$ for a taco that would have filled up my cat, but certainly not myself. It was not even the size of my hand and there was one mini tiny piece of fish in it. It didn't even taste that good either.  Definite skip their prices are outrageous. I prefer Chipotle for big burritos :)",1
3572,"Actual barber shop. Does razor shaves for head and face. Great value! Nice lounge. Local guy: ask for Larry. Speaks Spanish and English. Cold drinks available and a Starbucks next door.

EDIT: They have smocks with windows so you can use your phone while getting a haircut. Genius!",5
3576,"My friend took me here for the all you can eat for $18.95  lunch. I picked  a few things like salmon sushi, pieces were just the right size and they started me out with 8 pieces. It just kept coming!!! I would have spent over. $100 in LA for what I ate.!!!  The fish was real fresh and tasty!! I'm less concerned  about value then quality. That being said, best sushi I ever had.",5
3577,"Wonderful Sushi, good prices. Their other meals are excellent as well. Been going there since it opened in late 1997. Have celebrated numerous birthdays, anniversaries, etc. there and have the Polaroids on the wall to prove it.",5
3578,"Straight disgusting. Dirty, flies, super slow, the super small dining room was filthy. How hard is it to keep half a dozen tables wiped off.",1
3579,"Finally, REAL CROISSANTS!

For a long time I had given up finding authentic french, light & flaky, buttery delicious croissants in Charlotte supermarkets. They all offered up nothing but insults. Harris Teeter in particular should NOT be allowed to refer to that depressing roll of dough as a croissant. I feel the same about their ""italian"" bread, but anyway.....

Someone who shared my pain directed me to Fresh Market. Once I found it, I realized why I'd never come across it before. It is terribly hidden from the road in a quiet little shopping area behind the woods and near some residential complex. The pastry section is spectacular! Behold, real FRENCH croissants!

They are delicious, and I venture there twice a month to buy them in boxes of 4 to put in the freezer for breakfasts. They even have real rugelach..traditionally prepared!

THANK YOU Fresh Market :)",5
3581,"My wife and I checked out a lot of options for dinner and we're extremely happy with our choice of Libertine Social. It was fairly empty which was nice as it allowed the extremely attentive staff to pay even more attention to me and my lovely lady. I ordered a Manhattan and it was done just right. My wife ordered one of the specialty cocktails that comes in a bottle. It was delish (according to her). We decided to order a few small plates and boy did we choose wisely.

We started with the Hamachi Cones, which were out of this world. Spicy, tasty and unique. Next was the warm crab dip that had large chunks of crab meat and tasty bread that served as the vessel. We then moved on to the brussel sprouts and Choucrette. It was incredible. My wife didn't love the Choucrette but well, she was wrong. :) 

With tax and tip and two drinks and four small plates the total was $130. As for the staff, everyone was incredible. I would definitely recommend this place for a great place for a date.",5
3583,"This is a horrible location for mailing, copying, and other printing services. The clerks and the owner have been rude, snide, arrogant, and provide horrendous customer service. This is the third time I've personally received or seen them provide terrible service.  I won't go back again. The counter now contains a myriad of signs filled with misspellings and grammatical errors. I certainly wouldn't use any of their layout, design, or computer based services based on this evidence. When I went last week to drop off a package and pick up some stamps, the clerk said he could not  punch holes in an address book  for an elderly customer. I pointed out that the drills could easily be moved to accommodate the smaller book. He acknowledged that it could, but it was too difficult and then shrugged. The customer and I exchanged incredulous and confused glances. Too difficult? To move the drills on a 3 hole punch? On another occasion, the owner was shrill and rude to customers waiting in line. When I called to inquire about notary services, she rudely repeated several times that she was the only person there and that I would have to bring witnesses. I went to the UPS Store in Ballantyne where they used another employee as a witness and we asked another customer to be a witness. It worked out great, and their store was courteous and friendly. DON'T USE THIS LOCATION FOR ANY SERVICES WHATSOEVER. They are rude, unpleasant, and discourteous to customers of all races, creeds, ages and genders. Read the other reviews on Google+ and other locations.",1
3584,"Place used to be decent but service has gone downhill to the point of unbearable.  The third time we've been there in 6 weeks and the service has continued to be slow.  Staff is nice, but inattentive due to regularly being understaffed.  Tonight, had a reservation for 13, arrived on time to a half empty restuarant...took 20 min to get a drink.  Spoke to manager who apologized/said situation would be addressed.  Took order and food didn't come out for over an hour.  On top of that , forgot two of the orders.    Manager never came over.  When the bill came, they didn't credit / take off a dime.  From a customer service / business standpoint, just a total whiff.  Will never go back.  I'm actually just embarrassed for them more than actually upset.",1
3585,"I love exploring products without being bothered too much, so I've learned to appreciate the despondency of the typical Sephora employee.

3588,"My original compliant was never resolved and the owner's responses are ALL avoiding the FACT that he is not standing behind his 5 year warranty.

He continues to avoid the fact that the original installation was botched and then patched to cover the mistake.  I have posted pictures to point this out. Talking about the manufacturer and the product has nothing to do with installation.  From what I know, these are not employees that tint windows for him but rather someone he contracts to do the job for him.  This counters his claim of 'years of window tinting experience'.  I can hire someone too.  Wait a minute.... I did that and it didn't work out.

Offering to replace the rear window tint after having done nothing while having the vehicle all day shows what his intentions were, to continue to hide the poor installation as long as he could.  The more I questioned the color and the slow response, the waste of my day for 0 changes to the appearance, the angrier he became. 

My writing the Attorney General and BBB are all within my rights as a consumer to seek assistance with locating a possible resolution to issue with a local business/company.  Also, writing a review on Yelp helps to ensure other consumers do not get the same poor treatment. 

I have not written my co-workers. I shared my experience with 2 of my friends at work. This typically works in favor of a good establishment.  In this case, he is not happy about me sharing my poor experience with his company.  Also, these friends did not visit him. One did write him on social media to state that he will no longer be recommending his services to any other friends.  

Reading on other forms of review sites, Yelp and Facebook for example, the owner is continually rude to those that question his business practice.  He is a hot-head and cannot fathom anyone disliking the service, so much so that every complaint turns to an argument with these customers.  I agree with them and my reviews are an attempt to keep this from happening to other good consumers. 

If I knew that the owner would not stand behind his 5 year warranty, I would have never purchased tint and had it installed by Auto Details.",1
3589,"This place was delicious! Their sushi was so fresh and perfectly rolled. I also had their pork ramen and it was amazing! I usually don't care for ramen, but this was pretty darn delicious. They had this sushi taco that was weird but so good; never had anything like it. Would definitely recommend checking this place out!!",5
3592,Chris did an amazing Job with our car and took care of us. We had two different claims and everything was handled very professionally and he went over and beyond even fixing the tint that my daughter had ruined from the sun shade without charging us for it.

3593,"I don't recommend this school.  The staff is extremely helpful and friendly until you get in and are vested.  Credits only transfer to other regionally accredited schools and costs thousands of dollars each, so once you take a few you're vested.  SOOO many people fail out.  Even the best of students have to worry about passing after studying every minute of every day.  Nursing school is already tough but this accelerated program takes it to a whole new level.",1
3594,"despite all the hype about this place its very overrated! I have been there 4 times now because my husband loves the food, each time they get my order wrong! I always order the same thing: single cheese burger with lettuce,tomato, ketchup,mustard. and every time they forget at least 3 of those things! i've ordered a cheese burger 4 times and have never gotten one! The fries we got were cold and weren't even cooked! they were like chewy cardboard! absolutely disgusting! They called our number ""29"" we went to the window and they gave us our milkshakes and said ""your food is coming"". They called our number 3 more times after this and each time we went to the window they said ""oh you got you milkshakes?"" we said ""yes but we havent gotten our food"" this happened 4 TIMES all together! They would look at our order paper then just walk away and not come back while everyone else behind us got their complicated orders! Every time i come here the service is HORRIBLE! and they always get my order wrong! I will not be coming back unless i feel like standing outside for 40minutes for an incorrect order and getting my car hit in the VERY SMALL parking lot. This place is a huge rip off for how much they charge and how awful the quality of food is.",1

3596,"a couple of weeks ago I was out on a drunken bender at a bar and while fumbling in my pocket, I somehow managed to deactivate fingerprint recognition and trigger the self defense mandatory backup password on my Galaxy S6.  Obviously I don't know my backup password so like any other red-blooded American I started trying all of my 6,000 other passwords I could vaguely remember using in my lifetime, unaware in my inebriated state that my ""smart"" phone was keeping track of each misfire and holding it against me.  The next day, eventually it started demanding a password retrieval via my gmail account login, to which I also did not have my password.  When I attempted to change my password on my gmail account I got stonewalled. I couldn't change my password without a verification code and I couldn't get a verification code unless I could unlock my phone to retrieve a text...   So this turned into a massive catch 22 and the whole thing blew up in my face as I felt my entire life spiraling downward into the toilet one incorrect login attempt at a time. I called customer service and spoke to a couple nice people that were understanding, but tried to convince me that the only solution was going to be a hard reset - no thanks.  No way am I going to lose every kb of stored data I've worked so hard to horde in this last year because of a clumsily executed fingerprint ID attempt.  Tmobile customer service then hands me off to Google, and I went through the whole thing with their tech support as well.  Turns out Gmail is like, really secure.  Those guys don't mess around with identity theft.  If you are unable to reset your password using their standard recovery system you can kiss your account goodbye.  Basically I got told the same thing as Tmobile customer care - factory reset.  So then I call Samsung.  They have this really neat app that can unlock your phone anywhere in the world, and I started getting a little excited that this was going to work.  The young lady that was guiding me  through the process got me to the Samsung account login, and wouldn't you know that it's linked to my Gmail login.  At this point I've spent 3 hours talking to people from 3 different customer care departments on multiple continents, and now I'm drinking again - whiskey for the pain.  I decided to make one more phone call before surrendering to the factory reset.  I called the nearest retail store, this one on Charleston, spoke with a guy named Chad and told him the whole story.  I was like ""is there any way to get a verification code sent to another phone, since I have two phones on my account?""
He thought about it for maybe 10 seconds and tells me ""you can switch the SIM cards and receive a text on the other phone, then switch them back.""
genius.  I switched the SIM cards, reset the phone, received the Gmail verification text, reset my Gmail password, logged in to my Samsung account and reset my password, used the my-device global unlock to unlock my phone!
Moral of the story - fingerprint ID technology on your phone is unnecessary and can be dangerous when it falls into the wrong hands(mine). Also, special thanks to Chad for some slick thinking on the fly, and for saving all my vacation photos from the last year.",5

Has a little deli window in the back with great choices. I personally thought the chicken salad sandwich was one of the best I've ever had. 

Not a big wine guy, but from what I can tell, pretty good selection. 

The beer selection is great. Lots of the goodies I look for. Lots of local and national offerings, plus a good selection of Belgians. Couple of cases of Wicked Weed by the register. 

Don't forget to stop by the bar. They have 6-8 really good beers on tap. Quality stuff. 

Glad The Rhino has opened!  Be sure to say hi to Rob when you're there. He's the man",5

Austin showed up to clean my carpet and he is a true professional! He was so personable and went above and beyond to make sure my carpet looked tip top and was super clean. And even though my water source gave him some trouble, he resolved the issue and still powered through the cleaning process.

3610,"First off they do not wash their hands when they start work. This location is unsanitary, I arrived at 11am not open, two employees were sitting on the steps waiting for someone with a key. All the sudden 6 total employees show up to start work. I walk in they are taking down chairs & setting up the food station. None of them wash their hands. Nobody greets me or says it'll be a bit of a wait to get set up. At 11:15 I finally ask when are they going to be open. The girl says we're open now...again I had to ask. Then she throws on a glove & I comment that she needs  to wash her hands she said "" I'm wearing a glove"". Basically both girls used their filthy hands to set up all the food & & fill the new containers with yesterday's food & then wanted to make my bowl with filthy unsanitary hands, that hadn't been washed since they arrived. Finally she washes her hands & gets me a new bowl to start. Being already 11:20am I'd been waiting 20 mins, I'd have to wait even longer for avocado. I was done. I'm never going to this location again even though it's 5 mins from my house. Plenty of poke places to choose from. I've been to this location many times, customer service is lacking compared to their Rainbow location.

They clearly did something wrong or used a bad product because if it happened to both of us, it had to have happened to others.

They have a pretty darn good selection of firearms as well and if they don't have what you are looking for in stock there's a good chance they can order it for you. One of the items we came in looking for had to be ordered. Two days later they called and told me that my order had arrived.

3635,"It's my kind of bar. From the great bartenders & excellent beer selection to the hanging deer mount on the wall! I think this place is hard to beat in the Madison area.

I love the #2 Strong ale! It's my go to, (10% alcohol @ $6) I have no complaints. I truly enjoy a beer that I can drink 3 cups of and be toasted. Yup, it's pretty great. 

I also enjoy that there is a small bar food selection including nuts, pretzels, frozen Fabroni's pizza, meat sticks  & cheeses. 
Nothing overly elaborate that would force one of the bartenders to detour away from the bar for an extended period of time.
You could get away with calling One Barrel a classy bar for the ""I'm just here for the great beer"" kind of people.
The coasters are my favorite. They are cut squares of cardboard that someone has stamped with the logo (a penguin drinking a beer). 
Stay classy One Barrel! 

If you don't know the story behind why the logo is a Penguin, I suggest you ask one of the bartenders. I got a funny reply that I don't want to ruin for anyone reading this.

I love this bar.",5

It was packed when I arrived but luckily I snagged a couple seats at the bar and got a hh margarita. I asked the bartender if there were any sort of specialty margaritas for hh, and she said there weren't but she could add things, or make it spicy. I really appreciated that info. I got the basic margarita but spicy and it was perfect! She was SO on top of service and as I was waiting for my friend I could see her scanning the bar constantly to make sure everyone was taken care of. Wish I had gotten her name, whoever she is she is phenomenal. Once my friend arrived we got the guacamole with bacon, yumm! And after a few margs we got some tacos, which came out quickly and were fantastic. Great vibe, awesome service, and fantastic food. I love this place bc it's consistent. I haven't ever had a bad experience here. It's my go to now for margaritas and tacos!",5

3648,"I need to start by saying it's been a few years since my mother, sister, or I have returned from Cali. without Sprinkles in tote. I know my sister loves classic red velvet. My mom? Anything with coconut! I am so delighted to have Sprinkles right next to my job!!!

Welcome to Las Vegas, Sprinkles! (Ya took too long ;) )

Now I attended their pre-opening party and satiated my craving for cupcakes and ice cream. Thank you for inviting my family and I, btw. That still didn't deter my plans for being there opening day. My mom and I were 6 and 7th in line and got lucky with Lemon Meringue and Cuban Coffee being the special cupcakes. We each purchased a box of 4 for $15. I chose 2 cuban coffees, a lemon meringue,  and a chai latte. The employees are all very nice and excited to help the next guess. I love how the same person takes your order and boxes it so you know there will be NOTHING lost in translation. I have enjoyed every cupcake I've tasted except the chocolate marshmallow. I'm not a marshmallow fan though ""p The Cuban coffee and peanut butter chocolate are my absolute faves to date. 

Now I need to point out a few things. 

Is Sprinkles a lil more expensive than you would like? 
Sure! But you need to understand the quality of ingredients you are receiving. They use the best vanilla, valrhona cocoa powder, fresh citrus zest and berries. Plus they take care of their cupcakes by packaging them perfectly which isn't cheap. 

Will it be busy?
OF COURSE, DUH! It's not the most popular cupcake in the world or anything, oh wait yes, yes it is!!! There are 3 avenues to get your fix. Cupcakes, ice cream (where you can also get a cupcake), and a 24hr cupcake ATM. 

There will be haters. Let them be. Sprinkles is AMAZING. 

The end.",5
3649,"Delicious.  I called am they took my order before opening hours. Nachos!  Here I come.  Ok, Disappointing they will be closed on Thanksgiving Day, but hey I can show up One day before and stock up.  Lots,of hot sauce please need fuel for black Friday!",5

3655,"This in n out is always busy! But the employees work super fast. I was surprised my food came out within 5 minutes considering the amount of people ahead of me. The place is clean too, always seeing workers cleaning and sweeping. 

Okay, story time. Clumsy me, I wrapped my Invisalign retainers in a napkin and mistaken it for trash. By the time I realized it was gone, we were already on the freeway. I quickly called in n out, but it transferred me to corporate. I explained to the lady what had happened and she contacted the manager. I was already turning back to in n out. When I got there these 2 boys were going through all the trash cans and I felt so bad. I insisted that if it wasn't there, it's fine. 
However, one of the boy said to me, that this is fun and he didn't mind at all because it was different and not the same boring routine. He had a positive attitude and was very determined. The fact that he was so happy to do this instead of being grumpy from going through the trash, made it a better experience. 
The other boy decided to check the waste in the back and it felt like a miracle! He came out with the retainers in the wrapped napkin, just how I left it. I was so happy I wanted to give him a hug lol. but i didnt! This was all less than 10 mins, when I got int the car, the lady from corporate called me back to inform that they found my trays. 

I was really grateful that corporate and the in n out manager had good and quick communication skills. Makes me love in n out so much more.",5
3656,"This has to be some of the best Thai food we have had in Vegas! The Thai egg rolls are flakey and full of flavor! The pad Thai (chicken, shrimp or pork) is delicious!  The chow mein had so much flavor! They also offer karaoke on the weekends. This place is an absolute must!",5
3657,"FOR PEOPLE WITH ALLERGIES:

We had 2 guys in our dinner group today that had serious dairy allergies and based on the clearly labeled dairy free entrees on the online menu, we decided to dine here. However, once we reached Graze, the waitress and then the manager said they can't make the supposed dairy free entrees without cross contaminating the dishes. This by definition is not dairy free and definitely presents a problem for people with allergies. The restaurant also marks certain tems as gluten free and other allergens free. The manager explained that the cross contamination problem is also at play for these allergens and it would not be safe, for example, for people with celiac disease to dine there. Anyway, the restaurant misrepresents itself as a progressive restaurant that can accommodate allergies, but in reality this is not the case.",1
3658,"I had the crazy fries.  They were amazing.  So crispy, the toppings were generous and had a lot of flavour.  Some of the best supreme fries I've ever had!  I even went back to let them know and they were very grateful.",5
3659,"Honestly, the best burrito I've ever had. Not to be drama-lama but I think of it often. LONG and LOVINGLY. 4real. I had the Sonora Carne Asada Burro (definitely not the most adventurous but the most classic). It was HUGE and honey I ate it all. Full of tastiness. 

Small intimate restaurant kind of off the beaten path. My friend took me here and she loves the tacos. Next time I'm back I'll have to try them- but my burrito was so good I will probably just get it again.

Salsas GALORE at the salsa bar. I'm a woman who loves options and boy do they have salsa/sauce options! 

Service was good. No complaints.",5
3662,Steak fajitas as usual...but to go. I would recommend letting them know your tortilla preference and also to place the cheese in a container by itself. The Mexican rice was not that good; I would rather have regular white rice to go with my beans. There's curb side parking for to go orders which works out well when you don't want to park that far away. Overall the good was very tasty!,5
3664,"Came in for drug screening. Made sure I was going to be ready when it was my turn. After 20 minutes. Began explaining to staff that I needed to use the restroom. Staff ignored what I said. Waited another 20 minutes and couldn't wait any longer. Used the restroom only to come out and find out that I had only another two hours essentially to provide a sample or I'd automatically fail this test. This policy was never mentioned, nor was it on any paperwork that I had reviewed. 

Now I'm being forced to sit here and rearrange the rest of my scheduled business day, because they weren't prepared like I was. Very poor service.",1
3667,"I visited Advantage Beauty for the second time and they are fantastic!  The staff is very welcoming and warm.  I see Susan and she is fantastic!

3670,"Wow... All I really can say is wow. This place is a disaster. 
My boyfriend and I decided to check it out because it is a 1 minute walk from our place and I was craving the sweet stuff. It was quite busy, and I neglected checking the yelp reviews before I stepped inside... Bad decision. 

First of all 7.99 for a slice of cheesecake is steep. There was one on the special valentines menu that was raspberry chocolate cheesecake. Yum.... But when it arrived it was the most minuscule piece of cake ever. We were going to share it, but it was so tiny. Also -- I think their cheesecake is from frozen, it didn't even have the consistency of proper cheesecake, and I KNOW cheesecake :) 

I will never -- EVER -- step foot into this place again. I will go to 7 west for a good proper cheesecake.

3671,"So returned a few days ago and they had the bagel, so I had asked for it to be toasted and it wasn't. Or perhaps it was but because I waited for it for 25 minutes in the drive thru that by the time I got it, it didn't taste like it was. This location is ridiculous.",1
3673,"Well, this store just lost a customer. I was just shopping in here last week while a girl with the name of, Andrea followed me around the store my entire visit. I felt very uncomfortable and usually choose not to shop while someone is breathing down my neck, which is what practically happened. She continued to pressure me to buy stuff, continued to ask question, and continued to annoy me enough where I had to just walk out of the store. Now, I sadly have to travel even farther to shop and find another Francesca's, since I will no longer me shopping at this one. :/",1

3677,"I love sushi kui AYCE!  On Tuesday nights I believe it is 10% off and it's worth it even at full price.  We usually sit in the back room and it's always a full house.  This place has really good spicy salmon rolls and tempura rolls.  The sushi is fresh and it never smells funny here at all.  They have specialty rolls too like green dragon and red dragon included in the AYCE.  They also have a variety of pizzas - we always order the crab pizza.  It's good because the crab is shredded on top, not just sticks of crab.",5

Super, super generous seafood portion, with a huge piece of bread on top. The waitstaff seemed busy but was very friendly and helpful. I wish I had had room for dessert. The restaurant is very dark but isn't too loud, and I love how you can see the kitchen and pizzas being tossed. Great atmosphere!",5

I looked around for a dress and then went and got her and she grabbed them for me and took me to my room. She went above and beyond and helped me pick out shoes, jewelry, and even gave me ideas on what I should do for my hair and nails! She made my experience for my senior prom dress shopping special and I will always remember. Thank you.  also would like to add that I did get a lot of compliments by other staff and everyone else seemed very nice and pleasant! I was also very thankful how affordable yet great quality this place is! happy that my wallet wasn't completely broken. My dress was only 139. The seamstress was also very sweet and gave me the perfect length! I usually feel very uncomfortable and out of place doing things like this, but not here.",5

3693,"New to the Plateau I quickly discovered this gem.
Excellent, fresh food that reaches beyond bar food. Tuna tataki with salad and bacon? Amazing. Mushroom and mozzarella tart with balsamic reduction? I'm craving it right now.  
Small wine by the glass selection but it rotates often enough and the staff are knowledgeable on this point and will help you choose. 
Always a cool crowd in the evenings. Upstairs terrace (no smoking). Chill music playing every time.
Good for any night of the week - go check it out.",5
3694,This casino makes an individual feel like royalty from the moment that you step foot on the property. The chandeliers and art work all over the hotel are stunning. They make the atmosphere the hotel an experience that seems exclusive to each individual. We stayed here and experienced all the Cosmo had to offer as Gold members. Our suite was beautiful and we were even upgraded too. We used the gold of our stay to skip the line at Wicked Spoon with no waiting. It was a great experience and this hotel really makes one feel special and important.,5
3695,"Flew into Vegas, napped for about an hour and woke up starving! 
This was one of the few bookmarks I had that was open and it was close by us so we decided to stop in. BEST DECISION EVAR.

Service was impeccable, I mean really awesome servers, hostess, all of it was great. 

The food here was nothing short of perfect. I don't believe I would add/subtract a thing from the dishes we ordered.

Dozen kumamoto oysters - 5 STARS is an understatement. Absolutely without a doubt the best oysters my bf and I have ever had. We both fell in love with the kimchi sauce they provided us with, but seriously these things didn't even need lemon they were amazing on their own. 

Fish tacos - 5 STARS. We got a grilled and a fried and I gotta say I preferred the grilled. Mahi Mahi was cooked perfectly in both types of tacos. Oh and because we waited a little long for our food we were sent out an additional taco, awesome. 

The Dinghy - 4 STARS. Half lobster, King crab legs, 2 jumbo prawns, 4 oysters. All of the items were fresh and flavorful, but a little pricey for what you get. 

Salad - 4 STARS. We were provided a salad for waiting a little long for our food which was nice especially because it was a really great salad with excellent dressing. 

I'd gladly return here any time I'm in Vegas.",5
3696,"The most perfect arepas I have ever eaten. Imagine: the wrapper bursting at the top with tender, gloriously seasoned meat, the crinkly paper made translucent and sticky by meat juices and oil... your mouth floods with saliva after taking that first bite. Each one is filling and delicious; I was full after one and a half, and for $5 a pop, that's a fantastic bargain for a fantastic dinner. If I could only go back again! 

After eating here for dinner, I went back for breakfast: I didn't need to try any more restaurants in Vegas after finding this one.",5

3700,"A neck injury not only ended my international rugby career with Team Canada, it also confined me to bed rest for over 3 years. Jamie Camp at Upper Beach Health & Wellness was one of the few practitioners who understood the implications of my injury and has been the driving force behind my recovery to date. During my first visit to the Clinic, Jamie established a recovery program that featured medical acupuncture and motor re-patterning through exercise prescriptions. She thoroughly educated me on my condition and involved me in the major decision-making aspects of the rehabilitation; a style that kept me motivated and involved throughout this long and very painful recovery. I'm now relatively autonomous in my daily activities and, with Jamie's continued treatment and guidance, know that I can eventually return to full-time work and a more engaging lifestyle. Many thanks, Jamie!",5

3705,Very rude and unprofessional. The door man acted like he was the manager. And the chicken was rubbery and fries was burnt. Never again,1
3707,"This place is very overrated and overpriced. The chips were soaked with grease and the salsa was bland. It is just a typical chain restaurant. The margaritas were terrible-they use cheap tequillas in there house margaritas, also they have a poor tequilla selection. I do not plan on returning. The staff looked a little ""trashy"" our server looked and smelled like he had not showered in a few days-YUK!!",1

I took my aunt and uncle there because they've been driving me all over Las Vegas, even picking me up at 7am from the strip. So I thought it'd be nice if I did something special for them, as they love steak also! Once we entered we were immediately greeted by the host, and brought to a table. She explained the process and how this place runs, as this is everyone's first time at this restaurant.

Everyone was very friendly, always saying excuse me and please, when slicing the tender steaks onto our plates. They were even nice enough for us to have a photo op with them! Some people believe 25% tip is too much, but they really were exceptional. I felt that wasn't enough, I just didn't have enough to give them more!",5

3724,The BEST sandwiches! I wish I had pics but I'm always too busy eating my sandwiches! I started coming here because I heard a few people rave and now I even go out of my way to eat here.

So much cat and human hair had clogged the coils. He was efficient and very friendly. I would seriously recommend getting your AC unit serviced before it gets so flippin hot. Goettl is the company you want to hire. (he also gave my two little ones flash lights, which they loved )",5

We usually get one lane for the kids with bumpers and they have 6 pound balls for the littles! 
Snacks can get pricey, we usually split two large sodas (no pitchers of pop here), two large fries, and 3 big pretzels with cheese (great with the fries). They deliver the food to your lane so you can enjoy while you bowl.
There is a kids menu and cocktails, wine, and beer. 
Also a little area with video games for the littles so bring some quarters!",5

Well run, clean, and comfortable. Surprisingly diverse menu. Game night specials are also a great deal. But saving the best for last, is the breakfast! Only available on Saturday and Sunday, but worth waiting for on the weekend. Nothing like having a gourmet breakfast with a full bar. My kind of place",5

Top with some hot sauce and the house ""tartar"" that comes with it and you are in southern heaven!! The bread was soft, yet toasty and had this amazing yeast flavor that I love in a good bread.

3760,"I was impressed with Safeway compared to its competitor Taipan Tour.  The bus was very comfortable.  The tour guide told us that they removed an entire row from the bus so customers can have more leg rooms.  The bus was chartered from MegaBus so it had onboard Wifi both in Canada and in the USA and also had power outlet in every seat.  Our bus initially had some WIFI issue and the tour guide was telling the customers that we might be switching to another bus because of it.  This was very unexpected from a Chinese company and it's good service.  

The tour guide was very professional.....a bit too much talking.  Talked about every city that we pass by.    As always with these Chinese tour, it's always ""see as much in as little amount of time as possible"".  We visited 4 cities in 4 days and it felt very rushed. 

Also, the price is unbeatable.  We stayed at Hilton hotels for 3 nights(of course not prime location), but it's very comfortable.",5

I won't go anywhere else!

Update: September 2016

3769,I go here every once in a while. Great drinks at fair prices. Awesome food! Nothing is fried! Everything you want in a neighborhood bar without the grease. You will not even miss the fried stuff.,5
3772,"This Starbucks is brand new. Great customer service and my drink order has been correct each time. This place is a little on the small side.  They DO, however, have a nice patio out front which will be nice when the weather is cooler.",5
3773,We lived in Italy for awhile and Fabio's reminds me of how good the food is.   It is authentic more so than any other Italian eatery we have visited in the valley.   Love the raviolis.  Good job!!!,5
3774,"I had lunch there today. when I got there their was not even one customer in the restaurant. continue reading to find out why. this is what I learned. I found they serve very small portions for VERY LARGE PRICES , But I do have to give credit where credit is due I had two small pcs of halibut and a small hand full of very thin French fries the fish tasted like it was fresh caught today Very impressive. the price $14.99  OUCH ! 
This was my first and last visit to Oscars. If you want that kind on money for the small portions  I Recommend you move to Scottsdale where us POOR people cant afford to eat.",1
3775,"Nice clean rooms, comfortable beds and pillows. Shower pressure was real strong. Close to Rock and Roll HOF, Browns Stadium, Progressive Field, Casino and local bars and restaurants.",5
3776,"I was just there (@ #4135). I regret that I did not listen to an earlier review to ""Do myself a favor"" by staying away from this one. I have had great experience (over 10 yrs) with Meineke elsewhere- may be that's why I  gave this place a shot (two shots actually!). 
Long story short- was there for an oil change and was talked into buying a package for degrease and diagnosis of a possible minor oil seepage. Test result-no definitive finding with suggestion that valve cover gasket MAY be leaking. Again, they repeatedly said gasket may not be the sole problem. My damn question is why the heck you charge 70 bucks for diagnosis that you can't be certain. A simple google search tells you that gasket may be the most obvious cause. Maybe there was no issue with the leak at all.  Next day, I hesitantly went there again to fix the gasket issue and the front guy when writing the order said he will absorb the diagnosis fees paid yesterday with the work done today. An hour later, the bill comes as intact and on reminding him to absorb the test fee, he completely denies that anything like that was promised. Luckily, there were two other customers in the lobby had overheard the conversation and vouched for me. Completely disgusting, poor business ethics and terrible customer skills. I am yet to evaluate them on technical grounds as to whether the oil leak they supposedly discovered was real and has now fixed. Because of my previous good experience with the franchise I was there, but definitely this is a REALLY bad apple and by all means should be avoided. This is just my personal experience from last two consecutive visits and I thought I should let the public know.",1
3777,"This is a really great Starbucks location. It is in the Sunset Hotel and Casino-close to the hotel registration desk. The baristas are so nice & helpful. My son always goes and knows what to get-me, no idea. They gave me suggestions of what is special based on my likes. 

My son just got a plain coffee (that gets doctored with cream & sugar) but I got a hot white chocolate mocha. We both loved it. It tasted like a hot white chocolate but less sweet because of the coffee. 

I also came down one morning for bagels and cream cheese to have for breakfast in the room. The bagels were toasted perfectly and had an awesome flavor and texture. They do it right. 

They also gave us the whipped cream (from the drink) on the side so we could put it on the pie we had in the room. You guys saved the day!

I definitely recommend this Starbucks. They are so nice and go above and beyond to serve you.",5
3781,"I tried Glam Nails today for the first time and had a great experience! A long-time hunter for cheap and clean nail salons, Glam Nails gets two thumbs AND toes up. 
The space is bright, incredibly clean and looks like a high-end nail bar. The staff are friendly, incredibly efficient and detail-focused. My manicure and pedicure were exactly how I asked and there were no messy edges to clean up. Both foot and hand massage were great; just enough pressure and as it wasn't too busy, I was even offered a shoulder massage as my nails dried, great touch! 
There was a customer who had obviously been in before and was rather pushy with her timeframe and who she wanted to serve her. The staff easily maneuvered to fulfil her request without impeding the other customers experience. 
I will definitely visit Glam Nails again and if you're in the west end, you should too!
($50 after tax for a mani/pedi)",5
3784,I am a major pizza-holic and pomo is my absolute favorite pizza place in the world! They're service is amazing and the vibe there is so comfortable and fun. My fianc√© and I go there almost once a week. I highly recommend this place for anyone who wants an affordable and yummy night out!,5
3787,Robin is an excellent mortgage broker. She kept me up to date throughout the whole process of buying my home. She answered all of my questions and made sure I understood the process.

3793,"Obsessed. Deff on the must-eat-and-go-back-again-and-again list for Vegas. 

The good: The menu has a ""happy"" ie delish and calorie filled side and then ""healthy"" still delish options. 

The spot is in a random location but really cool inside. Colorful, cool art, nice staff. 

Specials! If you follow them on Instagram @eatskinnyfats they have daily specials and a secret menu.

The chicken and waffles on the secret menu is deeeelish.

The Bad: specials run out fast so if you want it get in there! 

Great spot. Check it out.",5
3798,"Went here for my birthday dinner yesterday with my fianc√© and had a lovely time! Not only was the food absolutely amazing, but we had such a nice waiter who answered all of our questions and made great recommendations. We came with a Groupon too and there was no lack in service at all. I'm so glad we came.",5
3800,"Came with my dad and his friends from Vancouver...all Chinese. We had the roast duck, roast pork, gai lan with oyster sauce, salted fish and chicken fried rice, and Singapore noodles. The group agreed that everything was as good as Vancouver's Chinese food and the roast duck was better than the best Chinese BBQ spots in Vancouver!",5
3802,"5 stars purely for the variety of flavors and staff. 

Honestly I thought the strength of the daiquiri was weak, but once you add a shot, it's not bad at all, for the price it's a bit on the high side, but meh...it's Vegas everything is overpriced. We went back a few times for refills and our drinks did get noticeably stronger with each refill, so that was nice.

Really though, drinking daiquiris all day is a bad idea with all the sugar added, we all had headaches at the end of the day, but it was fun and a necessary Vegas experience I think. The apple flavored one is amazing with an extra shot of vodka, just so ya know :)",5
3803,I love taking Bailey to them they do such a great job every time! She loves going there and always looks so good when I pick her up. I'll never take her anywhere else,5
3804,"First thing I have to say, is that the Scallops are the best I have ever had! We also got shrimp scampi those were huge and also very good. The Walleye was fresh and very tasty! I can't wait to try the fresh oysters on Monday! Thank you so much for a memorable meal. We will definitely be back!",5
3805,"This place is great! They helped us upgrade a few days early (within a week of the upgrade date). The regular Verizon Store wouldn't and was just slow and rude. Go Wireless was friendly, helpful, and knowledgable. We worked with KJ, who was awesome! Highly recommend this store, and a big shout out to KJ!",5

Friendly restaurant for crepe lovers.  I try to find a crepe eatery every city I visit; this is my favorite for Vegas.",5
3808,"there was three of us that went to see this show. wasn't sure what to expect since it was at a Hooters Casino. I have been to other hypnosis shows but not in Vegas. I want to say ""Don't bring the kids to the show!"" but why would someone bring kids to Vegas much less a hypnosis show? I have seen worse at local comedy clubs! my two friends volunteered to go up and I stayed back. someone had to watch their things. what he had in his show wasn't that bad. I was NOT embarrassed for anyone up there and I would have no issues letting my girlfriend or wife go up there. for a Vegas show the price was good. I would go back again and bring friends. considering the time of day (7:30pm) and the fact it was a Wednesday, and at a Hooters, it was half full. sorry, can't get the fact it was at a Hooter's out of my head. generally I go to Hooter's for the ""wings"" and beer! 

so bottom line, you're in Vegas, a town built for adults, and you want to see a hypnosis show that is different then most others, go see this one!",5
3809,"We came here while on vacation and the food and service is top notch. We got the Ruben sandwich and the chicken pitas. One with the fries and the other with sweet potato chips. All the items tasted fresh and were cooked perfectly. Also the quantity was more than we expected for the price, the corned beef was piled high and it was really filling. Our server was very nice and quick to help us out. The experience made our trip to Champaign much more enjoyable overall.",5

3811,"Beautiful store, well stocked and friendly helpful staff.
I have just moved here from the San Diego area and have been trying out the different yarn stores in the Phoenix area.  Walking into this shop felt like being home.  Obviously I didn't know anyone here but I was greeted warmly and offered help finding things if I needed.

They had a lovely table, set with cookies, coffee and ice water, in the back of the shop along with comfy chairs set around a coffee table with pattern books and magazines pertaining to knitting and crocheting.  They even had sample yarns and knitting needles for customers to ""play"" with or you could take sample yarn to try at home later.  Another large table with chairs was set aside for classes.

They have everything and anything you could want!  I found some yarn that I couldn't live without (I still don't know what project I will use it for but I HAD to have it).  When you check out, your purchase is logged in with all the info about the yarn you bought - right down to the dye lot, should you ever need to buy more later for your project.

I wish this store were closer to where I'm living right now (Gilbert) but It's honestly worth the 40 minute drive!",5
3812,"I was having really bad back pain late last year that rendered me unable to play the drums, which is one of my life's passions. Needless to say I was very bummed and frustrated by this ordeal. However after a couple of months working with Lauren and following the treatment plan she designed, I was thankfully able to get right back on the drum kit. This is a wonderful facility with wonderful physical therapists and highly recommended if you're in the need of physical therapy.",5
3813,"This new kid in town is definitely a welcome addition to the southwest valley.  For only $7.99, you can custom build your own pizza.  There are three different crusts to choose from - traditional, wheat and gluten free. Quite a few sauces and cheeses to pick from including their house blend cheese and a kale pesto sauce that I would have to try next time.  They have all the traditional types of meats such as meatball, italian sausage, bacon crumble and some not so traditional meats such as sweet sriracha chicken and some vegan meats too.  What I really love in their veggie section is the grilled zucchini.  Once your custom pizza is made, it is flashed cooked in under 5 minutes thru a conveyor belt.  It doesn't have the crispiness of a wood fired pizza, but I like it a lot because the crust is chewy and not too crispy. Their toppings are fresh and quite tasty.  

I ordered their traditional crust pizza with pesto sauce.  Then I loaded it with house blend cheese, Italian sausage, meatball, chicken breast, ham, black olives, artichokes, grilled zucchini, mushroom, roasted garlic and spinach.  They actually put the spinach on top after cooking so the spinach doesn't get all crispy and all dried up. It was very appealing to look at and quite delicious.  The crust wasn't all dried up.  But when I got the pizza home it wasn't very hot at all.  It was actually only lukewarm.  I don't know if that was because there were too much toppings and it should have been cooked a little longer or because of the thin crust it cooled off real fast.  Maybe next time I would have to eat it there instead of asking for take out.

I would definitely go back and try some other combinations.  I was a little surprised that they were not busy around supper time.  But bonus for me, because I did not have to wait in any line.",5
3815,"There's nothing they can't do. Harry and Jack are great people and true experts. Their price was more than reasonable. I've gone to them on numerous occasions for shirts, winter coats, suits, pants. All came out was tailored as if the original piece was made for me.",5

3826,If you want to have a good time and a lot of food I would go to this place. The food is in plastic bags and so it's a cool environment and way to eat food. Go here you will not be disappointed unless you don't enjoy good food and a good time,5

Everything was very professional, and I loved that he used a variety of different modalities (massage, stretching, heat, traction, etc).  I will definitely be back!",5
3841,"This place has been a consistently terrible experience. Like many at the SEVC, I stayed here and have been sorely disappointed - terrible choice!!!  The hotel is over 40 years old and the ""multi-million dollar transformation"" is just paint and duct tape. ""Ghetto"" is the best description of this hotel. The staff are not trained and, frankly, just plain rude.",1

3846,"Rudest driver that just picked me up. Also they make it soooo complicated. He says, you have a ticket?  I said no I already called that's why you are here?  He didn't even know I paid for a RT?  Omg you all had me on the phone for 15 minutes Saturday morning scheduling a ride  how difficult can you make your operation. So inefficient! They make you keep tickets and God  forbid if you don't have your stub for your return ride. The driver just yelled at me and made me pay $8 more for the return trip!  Even though y'all have a record of my RT purchase of $14.50 on Thursday!!!!you know my name my number my hotel my flight my bra size what the hell else do you need. He wouldn't even let me show him my credit card receipt he just was a total jerk!!! He just  had road rage and yelled ""asshole"" out the window at someone!  Slamming on the brakes. The girl next to me almost hit her head on the seat in front of her because he slammed on the breaks. The guy has some serious anger issues. And he represents your company?

3850,"Best tacos on the strip.  Open 24/7.  No ambiance just a cafe with some limited seating.  Food cooked in the middle of the room--you see what you're getting.

Went down here a couple times this week.  Good tacos.  Fresh sliced and cooked meats, pastor tacos were well spiced and flavored.  Big plate of peppers came along with it.  

24/7 was a big help:  tacos at 3am.  Mmm.  Bought total of five tacos for myself and the cab driver with two drinks total $13 bucks and they take American Express.

Give it a try.  Real good value and great hours.",5
3851,"I keep coming back, and bringing new friends along!

Today I had the buffet, and everything was so fresh (we got there about 11:45am)!

Each dish was distinctly spiced and delicate.  All the dishes had depth of flavour not found at most other Indian restaurants.

Normally I order off the menu when I go in the evening but today's Brunch was awesome.

Service (drinks) is a little slow -- you need to wave staff down, but the food is just great!

Lots of options, and even the salad-bar is extra-tasty.

I eat a lot of Indian and this place is always great!",5
3853,"So you know those places that you'd never just come across?  And even if you did, you probably wouldn't go inside if someone didn't tell you to?  That's this place and it's a total find.  It's tiny -- and I mean tiny.  3 little tables and maybe 5 seats at the bar.  That's it.  The whole place can't be more than a few hundred square feet.  They cook everything to order and warn you when you come in that it might be a while before you eat.   It's well worth the wait.   

We started with the little complimentary sampling dish - not even sure what it was, but I liked it.   We then got a the kimchi pancake and the mandu - both were delicious and flavorful.  An order of the beef bulgogi and a sample of the gim bap that my boyfriend ordered topped off the meal.   Everything was simply delightful and seemed very authentic.   It went well with the bottle of wine I brought in with me.  You can see them cooking it all order and they talk to the guests while they do it.   

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this place and would absolutely trek out to Cecil to try it again.",5
3856,"For the second year in a row the boyfriend and I have enjoyed a summer staycation at the Westin Kierland Resort. Even though it's only about 30 minutes from our house in Tempe the Westin Kierland makes us feel like we are away on vacation.

The resort is very large with lots of comfortable places to relax, dine or explore. The have two large pools, one is for families and includes a lazy river and the other is an adult only pool, which is what we opted for. The pool area is really pretty and kept very clean. There are a ton of chairs so you don't have to worry about getting out there early to get a seat. There are also a lot of umbrellas so you can find shade even on the sunniest of summer days.
They also have a pool waiter walking around making sure you have plenty of ice water or you can order drinks and food. I love being waited on at the pool!

The rooms are pretty large with their heavenly bed. They are on par with the other Westin's I have stayed at.

Right next door is an outdoor shopping center that has a lot of really great places to eat as well so you'll never be at a loss for things to do or eat.

I would recommend the Westin Kierland to anyone from out of town or   to anyone in town who wants an easy weekend escape.",5

If you guys don't want me to write a bad review than do your job. This time you guys collected the recycling bin and left a whole bunch of broken glass right in front of my driveway where I can puncture my car tire.

3867,"I'd be lying if I said my husband and I weren't skeptical about this place. We have nothing against Guy Fieri but with all his over the top lingo (off the chain? Really?) and his multiple shows where he eats other people's foods but rarely cooks (and when he does, he won't eat eggs???) - we kind of thought he was a hack and this would be a tourist destination for fans and not foodies. Everything about El Burro Borracho proved us wrong. From the drinks (the Caliente Margarita and Cadillac Margarita were both excellent) to the awesome bar staff (HUGE thanks to Jerika and Anthony, our bartenders) to the food itself, the experience was such a pleasant surprise! We shared the medium spicy guacamole with chicharrones which they prepare tableside to your liking and it was so fresh. The Mexican Fundido was just delicious. I had the Beef Machaca enchiladas for my main and I couldn't believe how good it was - like literally so surprised how insanely tasty. My husband had the Carne asada tacos which were so tender and flavorful. Beyond the food which was shockingly good, the staff there really care about the restaurant and the brand and proudly defended Mr. Fieri when we teased them about him. Will it last? We sure hope so. There are tons of great restaurants in Las Vegas but the whole dining experience here was way above and beyond what we expected. Guy Fieri - we guess you're alright after all! Next time we're here at the Rio, we'll be back!",5
3868,"First of all, a store that is advertised as a Ramen store should at least be using real Ramen noodles. Instead, they committed the biggest food crime by substituting the more expensive Ramen noodles with Chinese lo mein noodles. To make it worse, the broth is basically hot water with tons of MSG. The pork tastes like dry cardboard and it seems that the chef do not even know how to properly cut a meat. The egg is over boiled and even the mushroom used are the ones used for the actual lo mein dish. The worst crime is to actually having the audacity to charge $9 for a ""lo mein soup"".

I would recommend not supporting a dishonest business that tries to trick the customers. Basically, if you are looking for some decent Ramen, AVOID this place at all costs!",1
3870,"Stopped in after some shopping for a bite to eat.  I had chicken fried steak and it was not the conventional chicken fried steak, more of a batter fried then a breaded and fried.  It wasn't bad, just not what I was expecting.  My husband had the grilled ribeye.  He loved it., Our waitress Jamie was great.  She was friendly and  attentive, but not overly so.  She suggested dessert and I had the chocolate chip cookie,(freshly baked so it was still warm when she brought it to the table)  with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce.  It's a good size cookie enough for 2 and was delicious.  Will definitely go back again.",5
3872,"This fabulous restaurant is tucked into a corner of a shopping center just off of Bell Road.  Once inside, the decor is inspiring and the waitstaff personable.  The food, from appetizer to dessert, exquisite!  The spices in each dish were well balanced and unique.  While enjoying dinner, plans were already being made to share this place with others.  It is just too good to keep to yourself.",5

3884,Went here before Prince tribute and had some good food and drinks. Oysters fresh and tasty. Calamari good. Scallops  good. Squash soup good. Three of us got the Branzino whole fish. Subtle moist and tasty. Steak tartar and mussels. Cocktails great best Moscow mule I ever had. Good wines nice port. Service was great everyone was so attentive. Not slow like some other reviews stated. Got there at 5 had a rez. Out by 7 plenty of time to walk to show. Atmosphere a little cold. Booths were cool on street level. Would definitely go back.,5
3886,"Had two cars worked on at this shop this week.  One was for a transmission flush and the other for check engine light and transmission filter & fluid change.  Cal and Frank were great and took care of me.  Very nice waiting lounge, refreshments and snacks.  They explained what was wrong with my vehicles and showed me detailed photos.  They even texted and emailed me the information for my records.  Reasonable prices too.  I recommend checking them out.  Great service.",5
3889,"Can't believe I stumbled across this gem. I may never be able to eat another burger anywhere else again. Bacon was smoky, thick, well cooked; burger had great flavor and texture; the bun was the perfect thickness. It may well be the perfect burger. I didn't bother with dessert but boy did that banana split look amazing.",5
3890,"Always liked this place before today but they were nasty when I tried to pay.  They have some sub-par counterfeit scanner and tried to refuse to let me pay. It's a real 10 dollar bill! DON'T REFUSE MY MONEY OR DEMAND I GO GET DIFFERENT CASH.  I looked up the scanner and the user manual states that if the money has been through the wash, if it has been crumpled or if it is dirty it will fail their scan yet they don't even have a starch pen as backup. 

If you go here don't try to pay cash or they will give you trouble too.",1
3892,"I haven't been here in 20 years, so it's changed a little. If you're going on a weekend, go when it opens. I was there for 4 hours and by the time we were leaving, it was a zoo! 

There is a LOT to look at and learn. It's an information overload. We saw the Pompeii exhibit and Wildlife photography exhibit. Both were very informative and well laid out. 

Most exhibits had monitors where you could watch videos about what you happen to be looking at. For exhibits like Pompeii, it would be nice to have a short movie to sit down at watch, like an intro to the pieces you'll be looking at. It was a lot of reading and a lot to take in.

The ROM is well lit, bright and spacious. Luckily, there were many spots for you to sit down and take a break. They also had a lot of activities to keep kids busy. It was nice to see parents taking their kids there and helping them understand what they're looking at.",5

3900,"Very disappointed in this company for false promises and lack of communication.

I bought an Enlaes trunk spoiler for my Audi s4 at the beginning of April 2016 through their website. I understood it took about 4-6 weeks for production. After 8 weeks or so I called for an update on my product. They said that their distributor were having problems with their moldings and that they will ship out soon as they were already finishing up on new sets. 

Another month has passed which is already July 2016, I call for an update on my paid product. They told me the same thing, which They are still working on new sets and that it should be shipping out soon. Each time I called, they told me that they will call the distributor and call me back as soon as they have answers. They did not call back.

Its already Aug 2016 and i have been patient the whole time, and I finally gave up and called for a refund, they immediately called the distributor and said that the owner at Enlaes has offered to upgrade the spoiler to a carbon fiber one since I ordered the FRP trunk spoiler which is not carbon. I said okay since they promised that it would ship within the next week. They also made a tracking label and emailed me the info.

Its September 2016. the tracking label has expired due to no activity. They never shipped anything out. I called every week for status and the same false promising response was told to me. They made another shipping label and sent me the info. Out of all the calls I made, they told me they will give me a call back the next day for a response or answer, THEY DID NOT CALL ONCE.

Its today, October 14 2016 shipping label already expired last week. I made the call to see the status. Same answer. they claim they can't get a hold of Enlaes. I have been very frusterated and claimed for a refund. I was promised a upgrade for the wait, nothing was compensated and was not apologized for the inconvenience. I am currently waiting for my refund. I WILL NOT shop here again.",1

3912,"The 1 star review is specific to the doctor who performed my first chalazion removal.  Her name is Dr. Helga Pizio.  She was very nice and personable but her technique is in need of improvement.  She didn't numb me first, just stuck a clamp in my eye to hold down my lid, stuck me with a steroid shot and starting in with the cutting.  It was so painful.  I thought the pain was the lidocaine shot but when she said 'we're almost done', I realized she hadn't numbed me at all and the pain I was filling was the cutting itself.  Within an hour, I called the office back describing the excruciating pain I was experiencing and was just told that it was normal to feel some soreness.  A few hours later, I couldn't stand it and went to the ER where I learned the doctor had scratched my cornea.  With the amount of pain I was feeling, it should have been at least considered that I had a corneal abrasion and told by the office how to handle that.  AND, to top it all off, she didn't even get all of it and I had to go back a second time a few weeks later.  The second removal was at the same location but with a different doctor, Dr. Ksenia Stafeeva, and a MUCH better experience so that's why it's important to note that my rating is just for Dr. Pizio and not for New Eyes in general.",1

He will definitely be my first call in the future. The shop is in an upstairs location, so look up when you reach the building. Great job Angel! Everyone in the shop was friendly.",5

We walk in to check in hassle free we were there maybe 5 min and had someone take care of us and we upgraded our room to an amazing view! The bathroom was very nice so was the room very cozy and neat and nicely decorated too
 The atmosphere is very loud in the casino but the room was nice and quiet the first night we got married had a great time we went up to the tower. It's free to go up when you stay at the hotel the lounge there is so amazing it has a breath taking view of he whole city and your mouth just drop open in amazement! Although if your not to good with heights your legs will get a tingle in them lol my husband was Afraid bit got over it the next day. The hotel it's self has so many things to keep you occupied. Our second night we were out and about the city and it's very easy to get back and forth from the hotel every thing is close. We came back to the hotel to see the pin up show it's great music dancers and the men love it since the girls get to show a little more but not every thing  as a women I enjoyed it very much the music and dancing is just great!

3930,"Since moving to Toronto I have felt like a fish out of water in regards to haircuts and salons, I was always floundering around in search of an adequate stylist. I kept coming across Parlour at Ossington and Queen on yelp and whilst researching salons. It opened around the time I moved into my old neighborhood of Little Italy, and the salon's pretty and delicate website featuring photographs of stylists decked out in tattoos, sporting wicked hairdos, intrigued me. But it seemed just a little too cool for me, the idea of going there to get my hair cut intimidated me.

Cut to (no pun intended!) a year later, I was in desperate need of a haircut as I'd fried my hair real bad. Encouraged by my months' of research and pawning over the Parlour website, I finally decided to bite the bullet and make an appointment with Brionie, who has received rave reviews on yelp.

I walked into the salon, and was surprised, because it's completely white, and laid out very simply. There are no fancy-pantsy, obnoxious decorations placed out in order to give off the notion that the salon is more hip or fancy than it actually is. And that's because, this salon doesn't need to make up for shitty haircuts or bad hair-dye jobs with pretty trinkets or walls and walls of fancy hair products: the stylists at Parlour are really just that good and don't need to compensate for a lack of anything with a salon that is aesthetically fancy. The salon's basic and clean appearance helped me to feel at ease, I didn't feel nearly as intimidated as I had before. 

Atfer having my hair washed upon arrival, Brionie came to introduce herself to me. Brionie is super kind and cool. She listened to me patiently as I anxiously apologized about the state of my hair and she laughed in understanding. She then proceeded to take my hair and shape it, thin it out, and cut it so drastically without diminishing the length, that it was a miracle. Stylists are always really hesitant to thin out my hair, but I have ridiculously thick hair that needs to be thinned; Brionie has recognized that and always thins it out appropriately so that it not only looks good, it feels amazing.

The next time I went to see Brionie, I said,  ""Just cut it off. I'm sick of it. I want a cute, fun, short cut. I want it kind of Mia Farrow."" I came out with the best hair cut I've ever had. She listened to me and took into account my face shape, my hair type and generally what I was asking for.

I am completely comfortable with going to Parlour now. Getting my hair cut is now an enjoyable experience again that I look forward to. Best of all, Brionie never judges me for having dead, fried hair, whereas other stylists have scoffed or scolded. She actually used a phrase that I use all the time now, especially when talking about her. She said, ""If you don't have long, gorgeous hair, you're gonna fry the shit out of it."" And that's true. I fry the shit out of my hair time and again. And when I need it coiffed and perfected, I just hop along to Brionie at Parlour and she fixes me right up.",5
3931,"Stumbled across this place and was quite impressed.  I ordered the pork Carnitas wontons.. Omg.... Holy delicious... You get like 5-6 per order.  I order 2 orders as a meal.  The vinegar type sauce it's served with is delicious!!! 

This is located in the Desoto market building.  High end food, great price on a casual atmosphere.  Counter service.  Staff is very friendly too.  Try it!!",5
3933,"Before all the self-proclaimed ""foodies"" say that this is ramen not as good as California, NY, Japan, etc, keep in mind probably the best broth there is to offer in Phoenix. So relative to that, they get a 5 Star already. Not pretentious or hipster like some of the ramen joints in downtown, just a plain ramen shop with no frills. 
With that said, constructive criticism would be that the broth has too much garlic flavor and not enough of umami. Good body to the broth, but almost too much as it left a ""greasy"" feel from the combination of fat and collagen. Noodles were lacking some chew. If they used the noodles from tampopo it would be great (but tampopo broth sucks). Fried rice had good ""heat"" and was cooked well and fluffy, flavor was not bad, but missing something. Karaage chicken was ok, again, too much garlic and not enough other flavors.
Price is more of $$ than $. Cost me $19 (includes tip) for a karaage combo with a fried rice side, no drink. 
Staff were friendly, service was quick.",5
3934,"This show was absolutely amazing. The beginning of the show it starts off with a bang and it takes you on this emotional journey of high and lows, awesome and sadness. If you're an MJ fan you can appreciate the dedication that Cirque du Soleil put into his memory and his life.

3937,"Worst ever Indian restaurant. No taste, horrible service...Briyani served was reheated one for sure..super spice and no taste...would never go back and never recommend...",1
3939,"Just plain BAD!  

Its under new ownership and has really gone downhill.  The service was ok.  Aside from not honoring their coupons (I guess if a new owner takes over, they dont have to honor any coupons, even if the name remains the same...huh).

The food was also ok, something that tasted like I whipped it up at home.  I ordered the Pad Thai (I know, it was a gamble to order an asian staple at a ""Canadian"" eatery).  The ""Pad Thai"" was pad thai-less - no noodles.  Instead they swapped it with rice to make it an Indian fusion - may want to rename it.

The rice was minute rice, the veggies were typical stir fry and the ""nan bread"" was Safeway wholegrain bread!

The food didnt taste bad, but was misrepresented and for $19 I felt very ripped off.  If this meal were $7-8 then I would feel I got value.

Bottom line, with so many good restaurants downtown, don't waste your money here unless you are just stopping for a beer.",1
3940,"Nosh and Swig is a diamond in the rough.  After living in Vegas for years and getting tired of the continuous downfall of Firefly (not to mention longer waits due to more and more tourists frequenting it), I am always in search of tapas.  I love trying a variety of different foods and being able to share small plates with friends.  

Nosh and Swig fills this void in my culinary world!! The restaurant is hip and modern.  The staff (props to owners Steve and Laurie) is attentive and friendly.  Yet, most importantly, the food is amazing!  The menu is laid of by protein (or lack there-of since there is a vegetarian section) and it is filled with fusion flavors.  This could be overwhelming at a restaurant, but not here, because it is done right.  The portions are perfect for sharing and the prices are reasonable so you are able to taste a variety of foods and flavors.

Everything we tasted was delicious and it was almost impossible to agree on a favorite.  I can't wait to go back again and continue to sample and explore the menu (as well as the bar menu- they will be getting their liquor license soon!).",5

3949,"Well the theme seems to be same with most of these reviews! The customer service is AWFUL and the management is the worst of all. If I could rate them a zero star I would. I would NOT even waste your time with them.  My husband and I were in search of new living room furniture when we stopped in and Lynn (our sales person) was very helpful and patient with us. We weren't exactly sure we knew what we were looking for but she took her time and we never felt pushed. When we finally decided to order we asked her and the sales manager Josh if we change our mind what is the return policy? She and Josh both said it would be minimal if any bc we were going with very neutral colors. Josh the sales manager remind you even came out and said it would probably be no more than 10%.  But if we kept the money in store there would probably be NO restocking/ return fee. After much discussions we went ahead and ordered the furniture knowing we could return for a minimal fee. Well 6 1/2 weeks went by and we started to think it wasn't going to work out for us anymore and wanted to look at our options. I called Lynn and informed her that we'd changed our mind and wanted to discuss what could be done. She was very understanding and set an apt up with their interior decorator the following day. Well I arrived for my appointment and to my surprise the interior decorator was no longer going to be able to see me. No call or anything to inform me of this. Again Lynn apologized and had her ""wonderful"" (insert sarcasm) sales manager Josh over to help me instead. Well that wasn't really what I came in for & having dealt with him briefly before I knew he wasn't the easiest to deal with. But since I was there and they assured me he could do the same things as the interior designer could, I agreed to meet with him and see what we could come up with.  For the majority of the time spent with him, it was fine. And I found something that I really liked but I wanted to think about it and discuss it with my husband. It went downhill when I asked again what can we do with this order now that I know I don't want it. He said you can cancel (we haven't even received the furniture yet) it however you're going to have a 30% restocking fee. Unless I cancel it when I order the other furniture. But he still had to run this by the general manager (his father) 1st and show him my order was doubling in size. This is where I feel he slipped big time in his customer service. I had all intentions on keeping my money within the store but being told I would only get my full money back was too place my other order 1st.   I then told him that he and his sales associate said it would be a minimal stocking fee bc it was a neutral color. He then gets very condescending and says I'm just telling you what our policy is. I then correct him and tell him that he and his sales associate should not tell customers it would a minimal fee because it was neutral.  At this point I was getting very frustrated with him and his condescending communication and decided I was done dealing with him. I asked him to have his general manager call me the next day as I was not happy with his customer service. He then gets even more condescending and says ""what you don't think I have good customer service, I just spent an hour and a half of my time with you."" My response to him was, there's a reason your store only has a 2 1/2 star rating and from reading the other reviews I think your a big part of that reason!  Sorry sweet heart, that's sales and if I'm looking at spending over $5,000 with you and your store your customer service better be a hell of a lot better than that! Bottom line we ate the 30% bc I'd be damn if I spent anymore money with that ""family"" business of theirs. 
If you have your heart set on lazy boy, there are other retailers out there, so no need to settle for their crappy customer service.  I went to slumberland and was able to order the exact sectional with better financing to boot.",1
3950,"Visited the place with high hope after seeing the four star rating. Food was cheap and tasted cheaper. We tried three dishes.  The sweet and sour fish was okay, but a bit on the sour side with too much sauce.  The ginger beef tasted pretty much the same as the pepper steak, both were bland.  You can get the same spring rolls in the supermarket.  All in all, a :( experience.",1

3956,"OK, Went in for a standard ped, never asked what they charge because last time it was a flat rate of $25. So I sat down & had the standard ( no order off the menu) pedicure with Jackie. Ok what do I owe you, she said $28 bucks, well ok, if you want to raise the price on your own without consulting the owners. Will not be returning to pinkys. Ask before you have ANY service done, as no prices are listed on any obvious price board. That's just bad business!!!!!!!",1
3958,Fantastic haircut from Cain. He always does a great job. Everyone was very nice and friendly. Very helpful to select appropriate style and products.,5
3960,Delicious. Super authentic and the staff is extremely pleasant! We got the sampler plate and cherry strudel. You won't be disappointed!,5
3963,"Every once in a while, we like to go somewhere nice to celebrate a good day (or perhaps week). To Capital Grille we go! We love getting a drink and their crispy, spicy calamari at the bar. And it seems that every time we pull up a high-top chair, Jamie is back there being awesome. She always has a smile on her face and gives strong, yet tasty pours of our favorite drinks. One particularly hungry day, Husband and I split a cheeseburger and, well, let's just say they're my new favorite. And they're cooked to order! I'd gotten used to telling servers 'medium rare' and them hearing 'medium', much to my dismay. Not even a concern here! Perfectly warm, red center and brimming with juices. Consider my burger faith restored.

If you're coming here for the first time, I highly suggest you get Mike as your server. Always en point with wine selections and has a delightful wit. Thanks to him, we tried the cr√®me brulee dessert, which ended up being the best we've had.

Side note: Husband always forgets to bring his cigars, but they do have a cigar-friendly patio on the bar side of the restaurant. Perhaps once the weather gets better, I'll finally remind him.",5
3964,"The food and patio are awesome!!!!  Great place in the middle of town, fantastic lunches!  The staff is amazing!  I left my wallet on the table and the staff returned it with every dollar!  The owner is a great guy and made sure everything was OK.  Now - the food!  If you are walking around chagrin falls, you need to go here for lunch or dinner preferably outside.  Something for everyone!  I had the triplate for lunch, it was filling and yummy!  soup, salad and sandwich. Nice work guys!",5
3966,"What can I say, I absolutely adore this place. My usual order is large green tea and a California club. Their club is by far the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had. It had smoked turkey, eggs, bacon, cream cheese and more. 
On top if the great food, their employees are amazing. They are always super friendly, incredibly patient, and have never steered me wrong.",5
3968,"Location, Location, Location.  That's it.  We lived there a year and complained often.  Noise between floors, dog crap everywhere, trash in garage, etc.  We requested a move to another apartment, nope.

There is a VERY tight entrance to the parking garage with a blind turn.  Many people park illegally and block the narrow drive. Take care!

You have to give 2 months notice when leaving.  When we moved, they kept our deposit anyway.  They said they did so because the apartment had to be fully repainted.  When we first moved in, the apartment had not been re-painted - they just spot painted.  So seems excessive.

My advice is spend an hour down at Kaleidscope before you decide -- you will hear lots of complaints about management.  Wish we had.",1
3969,"Yep another bummer
At 913 i mobile ordered
No one will look up to make eye contact  its 930 now and she doesnt know where my order went...
Ok so own it, she made me pull the drink up to show her i ordered from that store. 
I specifically sat in lit and ordered

3970,"My family and I went on a Sunday evening and was told the wait was 20 mins.  40 minutes later we were still waiting in a lineup that had no system, where people were seated according to how pushy they were and how much they harassed the seating host!! I was appalled that such a big restaurant had such a disorganized seating structure! People who got there after us had been seated before us.  After I finally decided to complain and ask when we were actually being seated, the host takes us to a table that hasn't been cleaned yet.  With the table cleaned and us seated, the waitress taking orders purposely ignored our table to take orders from people who already had food on their table! Finally after waiting another 20 mins at the table without service or even tea (repeatedly asking to be served), we got up and left after the waitress took the order of a table that had arrived after us.  I'm not sure how a restaurant like this can operate and be successful, but it's definitely not getting our service again.  In the end, we went to the KEG and had a nice relaxing dinner for cheaper then what we would have spent here (that we didnt have to fight for).  

I don't care if the food is great or fresh...the service was terrible and not worth any amount of potential good food.

Lesson: Must be aggressive and fight for your spot in order to be seated, and fight again to be served.",1

3973,Great start with getting a free margarita by checking in. Ordered the queso and cheese enchiladas and both were fantastic. Super great food if you are in downtown Las Vegas. Excellent service as well! Would come again,5
3974,"If you ever want to have a quick nap before drinking this is the place to be. I literally waited almost 30 mins for one drink, and there was six different people behind the counter making drinks plus there wasn't much people. How is it even possible to make a drink this long. I literally could have went back, read instructions on how to make the drink, make a couple of test runs for taste purposes  and still make it before this place makes my drink. I feel like they imported the mangoes from Beijing like one of the bottles they sell. The corn was like fresh out of the can to top it all off. To make a long story short I am never going back to this place nor recommending it to anyone. I am only putting one star here because I can't put zero. Whoever manages this place should be ashamed of the type of service their employees provide.",1
3975,"I love the atmosphere of this place, but they fall short in so many other places. We went here for dinner last night and we were highly disappointed with both the food and service. We had to wait 15 minutes for a table to start, which is absurd considering there were no less than 8 open tables. We were just a party of 2. We decided to wait at the bar, which is where we should've stayed. We were finally seated, it took our server a few minutes to come greet us. We started with the Lobster and Crab spring rolls, which were fried a little too long, when we brought this to our server's attention he told us it was to make sure it was crispy. We of course never finished those. We asked about suggestions from the menu, the server's response was ""The most affordable way is to make a meal out of one burger to split and an appetizer."" Now I don't know if maybe the fact that we were dressed in jean and t-shirts made a difference, but to assume we needed to eat affordably was very insulting to say the least. We decided to go with a burger and a sushi roll. My burger was cooked closer to med well rather then medium. I wanted to complain, but our waiter only seemed to be interested in flirting with the table behind us. My friend's sushi was okay at best. To sum it all up, we didn't enjoy the appetizer, main course and weren't even offered dessert. We left feeling total unsatisfied. My friend said that experience was out of the ordinary and I should give them another try, but after that experience I think I would rather not. I would rather dine without judgement and assumption of my ability to afford my meal. Word to the wise, don't dress down or comfortably if you want to dine here.",1
3977,5 stars for this amazing hotel. They got everything figured out. Great restaurants. Great bars to drink at. Very happening atmosphere and great hotel rooms to choose from. Love this place. It's the only place I stay when I come to Las Vegas. If your looking for a great time. You can't go wrong with this hotel. Come stay at the cosmopolitan.,5
3978,"Yuck.  Three times burned.  I should have learned after the first two.

The first time I went through this drive thru I was served by a rather crass older lady who greeted me through the speaker with an ever so eloquent ""take yo order"".  I brushed it off thinking it was no big deal.  Until I pull up to the window, and see an older Caucasian gal with dirty hair, that looked as if she hadn't had a shower in a few days.  Greasy haired and snaggly teeth.  Exactly what you want to see before satisfying the craving for Jr Bacons.  The only words out of her mouth, now I can't make this stuff up, is ""Eight Fiddy"".  I hand her a 20, and when she hands me back my change I see the worst hands I have ever seen in my entire life.  Just down right nasty.

Second time was much the same including the greeting, and ""Eight Fiddy"" at the window, only this time her hands are even worse.  It almost looked as though some kind of flesh eating virus has taken over and was waging a war that it was obviously winning.  I learned my lesson from last time and had exact change ready as to avoid any contamination coming from her hands into my pockets.  But I can't help and notice a dirty bandage on one of her fingers in a feeble attempt to conceal the horror that was unfolding upon her hands.  This is complimenting her stench and even more gross hair.  EWWW Lucky for me the cook handed me the food thru the window.

So third time...

I couldn't even eat it.  I did a drive by the window to make sure she wasn't working it.  Success a nice larger gentleman was working the window.  I pull around after ordering my food, and much to my delight he was very nice, and prompt.  Only when he hands me back my change his hands were all jacked up too.  And to top it all off, he had what appeared to be open wounds on his second knuckle on two fingers.  I apprehensively take the change.  Not wanting to contaminate the vehicle again.  I put the change in on the center counsel not wanting to even think about it.  The food comes out, and WAM another gross shot confirming the hideousness of this poor man's hands.

I take the food, pull out on the street, and throw it out the window at about 55 miles an hour going down Cheyenne.  That 11.50 is glaring at me on the center counsel.  I know it has aids.  No way was I going to put that back in my pocket, and contaminate the rest of my items stowed safely away in there.  I'm cheap, I mean like cheap cheap.  Hence the 1.99 Jr Bacons...  I speed up, grab the money with a napkin from the center counsel, and out the window it goes.",1
3979,"Rose is amazing. She had little lash to work with and the results are out of this world. I asked that I look flirty but casual and she hit the mark. She is very honest about what to expect and even brought me back to add a few more lashes just so she could be satisfied with her work. It is obvious that Rose loves what she does. I went out after for a makeup makeover and worked with a professional makeup artisit and she coulnm't believe that my eyelashes weren't real. She said she had never seen such professional work. I am going back on May 25th and cannot wait. I also know that if I need anything iwht my eyes, Rose will always be there. THANK YOU Rose! Your energy is catchy! Love ya",5

From the inviting gal who helped us, to the jeweler who was working on wedding rings( at first we were going to have to leave it) She offered to clean my ring and check it's prongs. Very knowledgable staff. I would have used them as my jeweler if I lived here.

3982,Probly one of my favorite places. I didn't get to post all of the photos. There is a long wait time but this time we were lucky enough to be 3rd on the list. This is a place you wanna go they are super fast with everything you order and never forget to bring a what you ask for!,5
3983,"This place is a gem for the green valley area!!! I go every Thursday evening atleast just to stop and say hi. The owners are always welcoming and I absolutely love the oils and vinegars!!! I put them on everything salads, stir fries, or over fruit for dessert. I'm a healthy eater so this place is great to add flavor to otherwise boring vegetables and same old salads. But they also have a great specialty selection of wines and Thursday evenings they have been holding wine tasting while the district farmers market is open. I also got an amazing bruschetta mix. They always have fun hors d'oeuvre style treats. Everything from Spreads, teas, nuts, salts you name it! Really fun store to check out especially for gifts! Hope this store is around for long time!",5

3987,"This is probably one of the best bang for buck buffets in vegas. I always stop by here for dinner everytime I come to vegas. I seriously ate so much one time that I had to run into their nice bathroom and...

but anyways the line's pretty much a 45min wait on holidays and maybe just 20-30 on regular days. The first place I hit up is the seafood corner just to stock up on crab legs and sashimi, which btw are very fresh. Then I head over to the meats and poultry. Lamb and sirloin are super juicy and are something you'd find at a steakhouse quality wise. Then I head over to the pastas and finally the desserts.

Service is pretty proficient and quick, and the setting isn't really themed or anything like other vegas buffets, but still very nice. I'd recommend this place to anyone as one of the best all you can eats in vegas!",5
3988,"The food here is just superb! Both for lunch and for dinner.  Combos are good deals and come in a wide variety. I highly suggest their steamed seafood as they always seem to get it spot on without overcooking. Stuff from the wok is as good as I've had anywhere else as well. Service is decent, but the food is what I come for.",5
3992,"Had a wonderful meal. Victoria was an excellent server with a bubbly positive attitude and always a smile. Had the scallops on the special menu, which were perfectly cooked. Authentic key lime pie for desert (yellow with a hand-formed crust)",5
3993,"I was greeted when I came in, found all the amazing stuff I wanted, then I freaked out after I got to checkout and realize I forgot my 20% off coupon at home. Standing at checkout only minutes before they closed, I proceeded to checkout, as the cashier asked how I was doing I mentioned that I forgot my coupon, he reached in the drawer and scanned a coupon and told me not to worry about it! It made my day and I was so happy! Love this store and the staff!",5
3995,excellent place. One of our favorite places to eat. The staff is great and friendly and helpful. Always do a call ahead so you don't have a wait or a very long wait at all. The warm rolls and honey butter is to die for. WE love the steak and ribs that they serve. Have never had a major issue and when we did have an issue the manager too take of it.,5
3998,"I could not be happier with where I live.  The longer I'm here the more impressed I am by the staff.  Amber, Amanda, Shameka, and Julie in the office are awesome.  Prompt, polite, and professional.  Sal and Clyde are beyond great when something needs done or fixed in the building.  On top of it, Morgan Communities continues to invest more and more money into the building.  They've totally transformed the main elevator area, the gym is massive, and the gated parking lots let me rest easy about my car.  The location is the best in downtown, in my opinion.  The back of the building opens up to the Flats, the front leaves a short walk to W 6th, and its no more than a $5 Uber/Lyft to a Cavs/ Indians game or E4!  

If you're looking for downtown living, DO NOT LOOK ANYWHERE ELSE!

Oh and tell them Ryan sent you!",5
3999,"Omg! I have to say this is my second time eating here and it has completely blew me away! The first time was average and I wanted to give it another try and I'm so glad I did. I ordered the sweet and sour beef. Lunch special. I know! Beef! Where do you get sweet n sour beef! At least I've never seen? Only chicken, pork or shrimp. And I ordered the chicken potstickers appetizers. When you get the lunch special it's so much food! I received one pot sticker and one eggroll! If I would have dine in. I would have gotten a bowl of soup! It feed me and my son abundantly. He cleared his plate and I still had left overs. I'm so going here again just cuz of the beef! I picked the food up to take home and they are so friendly and nice! Great job guys! You have a future customer and I'll tell everyone about you! Thank you for being down the street and I'll be back to try other things if this was so good. Im sure a lot of other things are too!",5
4000,"I more than highly recommend using Superior Process Service.  I was a little leery at first because I am serving someone from out of state and the last company I hired botched the service by serving him on a Sunday which is not allowed in NY.  However Both Wendy and Tom are amazing people to work with.  Wendy communicated with me the whole time and asked questions about my states laws to be sure that they followed the laws.  The service was done within 2 days of receipt of my information.  I hope I never have to serve this deadbeat dad again but if I do I know who to hire to get the job done right.

Thank you Wendy and Tom!!!!",5

4004,"More than disappointed time and time again. I work in the same complex so I have tried quite a few things of the menu. I've had burned onion rings. Chicken wings that were sooo spicy I couldn't eat them. I ordered medium because they don't offer a mild. It was not medium. They were hot like fire! When I got the burned onion rings the waitress that answered the phone was arguing with me about the order instead of offering to fix it. They skimp on sauce when they feel like it. Sometimes I'll get a full container and sometimes they half ass it and give me very little. I got an order of chicken nachos the other day that were delicious, they had plenty of toppings and really tasty cheese sauce all over them.  Well I wanted to get them again today and was pissed to have paid 11 dollars for some chips! Barely any cheese at all. All I gotta say now is I won't be eating there any more.",1
4005,"I wish the food I order everytime I come here wasn't soooooo darn good so I can try everything else! 
Hangover bliss!or (munchie paradise) Never disappointed!
 3 years going strong! Jade red chicken, pollo Diablo quesadilla, and pork fried rice everytime! 
Hits all the notes! Spicy,sweet,savory, and packed with flavor! 
The place looks like a hole in the wall....with a crowd out the door! Give Chino a try!!!! Mucho awesome!!!

You get a cookie with every meal! What more do you need!?",5
4006,"Shibuya is really stunning.

Because it's Vegas, they can get away with a decor that's unlike any other restaurant in the world: walls that look like trees, large dark tables, a massive sushi bar, a wall of sake.  It works, if you're willing to relax and enjoy it.

We had edamame -- fresh, juicy, crisp, a tiny bit too salty but still very good.  The oyster tasting -- I haven't had oysters in many, many years, but I decided to take a chance, and the oyster tasting at Shibuya was the best thing I had the whole trip.  Yes, oysters in the middle of the desert, I was worried too...but they were amazing, beautifully prepared, and delicious.  I did the sake tasting as well, which was wonderful, and then two of the specialty rolls (the Shibuya roll and the Hokkaido roll -- the Shibuya roll was not spectacular, but very interesting; however, the Hokkaido roll was truly wonderful).  It was really excellent food, beautifully prepared.",5

4008,"DO NOT GO.  I repeat, DO NOT GO.  I URGE you to stay away from this business.  Read the reviews on Google!  They are all terrible and I had the same experience. BTW - they are not registered with the BBB.

 I took in clothes to get dry cleaned, and they came back completed wrinkled. They might as well have trampled on them and then called them clean.  I complained, and they took my clothes back again.  I came back two days later, and guess what? The clothes were still totally wrinkled.  Not only that, but they damaged a designer dress of mine.  After calling back to see if the owner was in for a week, he finally called me from a blocked number.  The owner, Nick Dominico, told me that the damages were basically my fault and that he would not refund me.  He then yelled at me and hung up on me.  I filed a formal complaint with the BBB and will follow up with a complaint with the City of Scottsdale.  GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.",1
4010,"Management, I hope you're reading!! Your staff is terrible. I refrained from writing a review for this location until I've been here enough times to be sure. I have come in on a few occasions and just stand there at the counter. All of your employees see me. Not one person says ""someone will be with you shortly"" or anything of the sort. My last time I waited 7 minutes before the girl came to the counter. She didn't even say ""oh I'm sorry about that."" Damn horrible service, staff!! Lucky I like your Get Up and Goji otherwise I wouldn't put up with this crap. Fire your whole crew!",1
4011,"Despite many of the extremely poor reviews that Marcello's has received on Yelp,my wife and I decided to take a chance and dine there last evening.  The short of it - I wish we hadn't. 

Service was generally good, the waitress was attentive and the restaurant had a suitable ambiance - a good combination of family style and traditional Italian.  The food, however, was a much different story.  My wife and I both ordered pizza - I ordered pepperoni and she ordered Canadian bacon with pineapple.  Both of our pizzas were the most absolutely tasteless, bland concoctions we have experienced.  There was literally NO SAUCE on either of our pizzas, just greasy cheese, a very flat, bland crust and a small amount of toppings.  Without sauce, the pizza was just terrible - it was dry, somewhat greasy from the cheese and it literally had no flavor whatsoever.  This was the most disappointing meal that I have had in quite some time and it came to $40 including tip for 2 pizzas, 2 soft drinks and 2 salads.  When I told the waitress about the quality of the food, she simply mentioned that they have a new person preparing the pizzas in the kitchen and that things may be a little off due to the transition.  It seems puzzling that someone, despite how new they are, could forget to put sauce on the pizzas.  Honestly, I'm not sure sauce alone would have been sufficient to revive Marcello's tasteless pies.

If you are hungry for pizza, you will be much better off buying a Tombstone or a Jack's for $4 at Walmart and cooking it yourself.  Or better yet, go to Boulders on Broadway or Grimaldi's where you will get excellent food and great service at a comparative bargain price.",1

No need to educate ignorant people with how to measure time. Good food, sad service.",1

4022,If I could give negative stars I would. My daughter and her basketball team decided to do a team bonding activity here. After paying and skating for 30 minutes she was approached by staff who demanded she take off her headband that coordinated with her outfit. The staff told her and a  team members their different color headbands were gang affiliated. These young ladies are scholar athletes and by no means gang members. There were other people in the rink with headbands and head wraps. My daughter did not want to stay due to their discriminatory practices. I asked to speak with the manager who could say nothing but 'it's the owners policy'. When I asked to speak with the owner I was told they are not available but if I called after hours I could leave a message for the owner. This place does not deserve to continue to take your $11 as long as they discriminate and profile.,1

Go to Taj Mahal instead!",1
4037,"Unexpected gem.  

We went for the pre-theatre menu expecting a good quick meal.  We knew it was a Michelin starred restaurant, but we recently dined at 2 3 stars, so we weren't expecting huge things.  

From the moment we arrived, service was impeccable.  While we started with tap water, our neighbors asked for San Pelligrino.  While they do not have San Pelligrino (they serve another type of sparkling water), they offered to go to other restaurants to find San Pelligrino if needed.  They also recognized diners for a few months ago, which I though was very nice.

Anyways, on to the food.  We did the pre-theatre menu. Our amuse bouche was a english pea soup and a croquete of something tasty but I do not recall the details. My husband had the beef tartare and I had the lobster bisque.  Both were perfect.  The beef tartare had a perfect mixture of beef and greens and they were paired perfectly with the lotus chips.  We did not even touch the accompanying toast because we did not need them.  The lobster bisque was lick-your-plate clean good.  

For our main courses we had the salmon and beef tenderloin.  The salmon was good, but the beef tenderloin was the star.  It was the best piece of meat we have had in several years.  It was perfectly medium rare.  When I cut it and saw the texture I almost cried from how beautiful it was (just kidding, but I imagine a steak lover somewhere would).  My husband sat around with a goofy grin for the next half hour because he was so happy from eating it.  

The dessert was so creative, BUT TASTY.  Some ""fancy"" restaurants make the mistake of being creative and weird tasting (I'm looking at you Le Meurice with your bee pollen dish aka assault on the tastebuds). One was a chocolate ball that came out in a beautiful globe that was promptly melted away by hot fudge to reveal vanilla ice cream and chocolate/hazelnut. As my husband put it ""a giant delicious ferraro rocher.""  I was presented with a coconut.  When the lid came off, I saw a sea of beautiful white foam.  It was COCONUT FOAM.  If you tasted just the foam itself, it was delicious!  But combined with the pineapple sorbet and the fruit hiding underneath... heavenly.

I like food, and my husband usually just comes along to these ""fancy"" restaurants to appease me, but this time he was also very happy.

yay for you, Le Cirque!",5
4040,"This is my favorite Taiwanese restaurant in Pittsburgh. The crispy pork chop noodle soup is finely made and served. 
Some special dishes are not on the menu so don't forget to ask for recommendations on the whiteboard.",5
4045,"Strip: Mouthwatering steak, scrumptious side dishes, perfect atmosphere.

Reservations, while not required are definitely suggested for Fridays and Saturdays, dinner is served from 4p-10p, but the bar opens at 3p.

Strip describes its d√©cor as ""primitive elegance"" - it's located inside Olde Avon Village's Ewers Barn which dates back to 1851. Upon entering, you will find a bar located to your left - where you can enjoy a Tickle Me Pink martini (yum!). Upstairs you will find an intimate contemporary dining room. Outside - (which I have yet to enjoy) is a spacious patio complete with waterfall and fire pit.

The ""Dinner for Two"" has been our go-to both times, it comes with two 6 ounce filets, two house salads or soup of the day, two sides, and a dessert - all for $79.  You can get the 12 ounce steak if you wish and any of the salads (all for modest upsize charges).

My personal fave is the Trapped salad (cold lobster salad with cherry tomatoes, carrots, celery, and onion in a mayo-base dressing and layered with fresh guacamole), the 6 ounce filet with Horseradish Cream sauce, and the Gruy√®re Mac & Cheese as a side.

The menu garners a pretty big selection of ""soups & starters,"" including tator tots (stuffed with bleu cheese and bacon, served with whole grain mustard) and Crab Cakes (three Maryland style cakes with pickled ginger remoulade). When it comes to making selections - you will have plenty of options here at Strip. Even though Strip is a Contemporary Steakhouse - they're also known for their delicious Seafood selections. Not to mention, it's Clam Bake season now and they're running some delicious specials!

Strip is a great experience for a special celebration or a first date (it's fancy but not so fancy that you can't roll in, in some dark jeans and a nice top).

During our last visit our waiter filled us in on the fact that they will be revamping the menu to include some savory Fall dishes - we're looking forward to it and will be back soon!",5

Tonight (July 14th) we tried them again and it was a totally different experience. Two thirds of my entree was actually cold, like right out of the refrigerator cold. The plate was too hot to touch, but most of the food was cold. I complained - actually what I asked was to have it reheated. The waiter honestly did not seem to be able to comprehend what I was asking. He took my meal back into the kitchen. The manager came over and actually began to argue with me over whether my food was actually cold. He insisted that it was only room temperature. Pardon me, but that is unacceptable. Food should not be room temperature out of a holding bin and a manager should never argue with a customer, especially over a clear health code violation. He left and I wondered if they were going to reheat mine, bring me a new one or forget the whole thing. 

The waiter came back and asked if I wanted my check. When it arrived they had reduced the cost of the one entree by about 50%. Normally I would have had another talk with the manager, but he seemed so clueless that another attempt would have been futile. There are many better Mexican restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. Hopefully a better one will take its place after this one closes. What is a shame is that our first experience there was so good. It shows they are capable of being a great restaurant. I doubt if I ever would give them another chance. I should mention that on our first visit the salsa was great. Good flavor, nice mix of spices with just the right amount of heat. On our second visit it tasted like tomato sauce right out of the can.",1
4057,"This was definitely worth the money we spent. My boyfriend and I went on the tour and it was very well organized. The walking wasn't too much, you would definitely do a lot more walking just strolling through the strip on your own. 

I found this tour on yelp and trip advisor, they had such good reviews and ratings I thought we should give it a try. My boyfriend and I are huge foodies so we thought it would be perfect and this tour didn't disappoint! We left very happy (happy enough that I'm writing my first review EVER!) haha. 

During the walks our guide had little facts and bits of info on the structures and art installations around us. I must say that was a very nice touch considering it was my first time in Vegas. He also recommended other places to try other than the restaurants we were going to, I loved that too! 

Restaurant wise the other reviews I read were right, it's VIP service. You sit down almost immediately and the food comes out not too long after that. Our guides explained the food further than the little special menu we had and also gave some information about the restaurant itself. We got to try a lot of new things and they were so delicious. Just be careful, you could definitely get full pretty fast. 

We also bought the drink package and I don't want to ruin what to me was a surprise. All I can say is we didn't finish all the drinks at each place (one per place excluding the dessert place) BUT the experience was worth it haha. 

Overall, food was 5 stars, guides were 5 stars, and service was 5 stars. I'm recommending it to any foodie who has some time in Vegas and definitely doing it again especially when they add more restaurants.",5
4058,"So f---ing good. We went on March 24 for lunch.

We didn't have a reservation, so we sat at the communal table. We started with the mushroom soup with garlicky croutons - so nuanced and delicious. And, wow, they don't charge for bread (we're looking at you, Ava in Tampa). We then had the braised beef ravioli - delicious and perfectly done. Great wine selection too! We had the sacher torte for dessert. Delicious as well, though there was almost too salty an edge to it. Also, our server was great. My friend is a huge pain in the neck at restaurants and our server never lost her cool. Overall, I would go back in a heartbeat. Bravo!",5
4059,"I've been here 3 times so far. 
Especially when I crave : jajangmyeon. Not too salty. Hits the spot.
Reasonable on the pocket, not too fancy and they have that button on the table for quick service. The sides are kinda random when I look at other tables.",5
4060,Just got back from the bronze bar and I cannot be more pleased! The results are amazing and I do not look orange or streaky in the least. Laura is very welcoming and makes you feel like you are the only customer (even though she had several appts that day). Too many times I have been to airbrush tanning places that feel rushed and not through but not at the bronze bar! I will definitely will be returning for another sun kissed glow in a few weeks!,5
4061,"I have had my vehicles serviced By Don Velasques, owner of V&V, for 16 years. He is honest, fixes problems right the first time, reasonably priced, stands behind his work, works with the customer, repairs done quickly.  There has never been a problem he didn't fix. I highly recommend V & V.  I wish all mechanics and service centers were like V&V.",5
4064,I walked in this place with a pocket of cash and intent on buying a new gun and was ignored for ten mins. by two employees leaning against the counter talking about their weekend. So I walked out with a pocket of cash and intentions to not come back. Another gun store where you're ignored if your not old and well dressed.,1
4065,Loved it! Fabulous hummus. I had the chicken tenderloin shish and hummus. Best hummus ever. Nice staff too.,5
4066,"Sorry Bill, this review is WAY over due. About a year overdue.

I bought a new dryer about 3 years ago; a newer style whirlpool cabrio. Well about two weeks after the warranty expired, last summer, it started intermittently making an odd oven timer buzzing sound, and was having a hard time drying. 
I'm pretty handy and usually a DIYer, but I don't have any experience with Gas appliances. So I went searching and found Bill.  We called Bill up and explained what was happening. He came out the first day we were available. And of course when he was here, we couldn't get it to repeat our issue. He looked it over and couldn't find anything obvious. Since the dryer was playing hard to get, we had him look at the oven, which hadn't worked since the 2nd day we moved in(it did work the first day). He had it diagnosed and fixed within 30 min. He said he'd research our dryer to see if anybody else had the same issue. 
He called me two days later with some info on what it could possibly be. He said we'd replace this part, if it doesn't fix the problem, then he'd refund it. We gave it a try, but it still started doing the oven timer impersonation. We finally were able to get a video of the dryer making the sound. After that, he was able to do some more research and found something unique to our model that might cause our problem. He came out the first day we had off, and fixed it in 45 min( had to take the whole thing apart to get to the part whirlpool had hid in the back). no problems after that. 

Bill went way out of the way to track down our issue, and at a great price(especially with my wife haggling him). Both the dryer and oven are still running great.
New truck looks great Bill.

Hey you got any recommendations for a HVAC tech? My AC decided it was going on vacation, perfect timing considering the weather is now cool enough I don't need it, but I still want to get it working while we can take our time.",5
4069,"My experience with total freedom and their entire staff was amazing. I have never been to a doctore office of any kind where I was treated so kind and with such respect . I am truly happy with the service they provided. I have told all my friends and family about the excellent service I received.  Thank you all at total freedom dentistry 
Carrie",5
4070,"First timers in my group of six visited this week.  We were treated as if we were royalty by Tony.  We received the complimentary garlic knots which were soft and when dipped in the sauce were a tasteful delight.  The pizza pies were delectable, perfectly baked, with fresh ingredients.  In holding with the Italian tradition of treating everyone who walks through the door as family you simply can't go wrong eating here.  Food, service, and very personal touch in their service makes this business go on my ""A"" list!  Thank you Tony and crew for a wonderful experience.  We will be back soon!",5
4072,"I went into CVS specifically to use Kodak kiosk, I was having a bit of trouble downloading photos onto a picture disc, I asked this delightful lady who was, I believe to be the manager, her name was Mary. She was my hero. What took me 45mins to figure out,(I was too proud to ask for help from the start)  Mary did it in 15. She was very kind, patient, and professional.  Mary had her hands full helping me and still made sure people were helped at the counter. Great customer service which will keep bringing me back to this particular store. ~fin~",5

4077,"I've been here about an hour and I'm already over this place. When you first walk in the smell of cigarettes chokes you, not good for anyone who has health issues, or you know, just doesn't like cancer. We get to our room and it's a mess. Towels everywhere, questionable fluids on the floor, just completely dirty. They moved our room, but the time spent moving was the time we were going to use for dining out at dinner. So, going to bed hungry with smoke covered clothes, and still wondering what the hell kind of fluid was covering the bathroom floor of our original room.",1
4081,"Absolutely amazing show.  Their voices are perfect.  I loved the variety of music and the humorous nature of the show.  I could have maybe done without some of the cheesy audience participation, but their sheer talent made it an amazing night.  Some of the best vocalists I've ever seen.  It's an absolute must see for someone who just wants a light hearted musical show to cap off their Vegas evening.  They also had a couple of dancers who highlighted the songs with their choreography and they were also great!  It's a wonderful show appropriate for all ages but definitely on the more old fashioned side.  I loved it!",5
4084,"I understand where people are concerned and cautious of auto repair shops, I would be too.  I have friends who know just enough not to get screwed and they told me I had dirt/sand where my break pads are and all I needed to do was have it cleaned.

I came here and had them check it out, then came the BS they gave me.  Wow, for a nationally recognized chain I was so disappointed.  I said I would pay for labor, simply to clean out the dirt and debris but they said I needed to replace my brake pad.  It's been a year now and I have the same brake pads.

Lying much?  Yup.",1
4086,"They need to call it the BIG BISCUIT ,food is great and plenty of it. Met the new manager and have to say its a real pleasure to talk to her. Shes a breath of fresh sir, someone who really makes you feel welcome quite a switch from never seeing mgrs. in the past",5
4089,"I had to use this place once before and had met with the lady and she was really great and she got me a place. So I went back needing another place and move on to another area. I was hoping that they would have a really great service. I spoke to CHRIS JONES and he had made an appointment for that weekend. I felt a little off because of the fact that I told him I was moving in 6 or more months and I wasn't sure if I needed appointment right away. He was extremely insistent so I was like I'll try it anyway. So then the day before the appointment he texts me and says are you coming in for your appointment. I thought it was kind of rude but I let it slide and I said no you're mistaken it's for the following day. So then the following day I go in for my appointment and I was already kind of feeling like this probably wasn't a good idea. I go in and right away he assumes that we had talked on Facebook or Craigslist, this guy had no remembrance of our conversation previously during the week. So at this point I'm frustrated because I know this guy is probably full of s***. If you can't remember a conversation 3 days ahead of time and if you can't make a correct appointment time something's not right. So I'm very blunt with my answers and then he's asking questions about my income how much I make and what I'm looking to move in at I told him a price range and right away he's giving me these facial expressions like like I'm rude or I'm being unhelpful. I told him isn't it your guy's job to help me find a place why would I look at apartments in that price range on my own and then be here? So I knew this guy was given attitude and I was going to give it straight back so I was like you know what it's not going to work out and I walked out. Right away he crumpled up my paper application into a ball. This guy put off such a f****** attitude there was no reason for me to be nice back. I'm sorry but if you can't f****** get your clients together and remember s*** then why the f*** would I want to use your service? Plus I did not see one single woman working in that office it's like they fired all of the women and it was all some stuck-up arrogant assholes running that f****** s***. Needless to say two or three years ago that location was running great, now I wouldn't go there if they were the last person on Earth. Don't even get me started on how they were trying to s**** on another lady and tell her they couldn't find her a place for $1,000 a month this girl had money and they were f****** shiting on her I think they turn into a bunch of scam artists so don't even bother here.",1
4092,"I've always been a fan of EBS, and now there's one conveniently located in my neighborhood!!  Yes, I pulled up on Grand Opening Day and was one of the first 1000 to score a free travel mug!!  

Spinach Florentine is my absolute fave, especially with Sundried tomato cream cheese! Located in the old Backyard Burgers, and briefly, Ikos Aegean Grille, I can tell EBS is here to stay.  Steady traffic all the time! Had the PM $5.00 bundle for lunch and almost tried the iced coffee instead of tea.  Oh well, maybe next time when it's closer to 12 noon and I can afford another java jolt for the day!

Nice parking, (can take advantage of all the bank lots across the street for any weekend overflow).  Easy access in and out and very quick and friendly service.  The manager was on top of all the details!",5
4094,"PLEASE do not visit this clinic. I started seeing Dr. Ahn late last year for epileptic seizures, and I'm sorry to say that my disorder has gotten worse since then. 

I take my disorder seriously, but unfortunately, she doesn't. She rushes me out, takes no time to address my concerns or symptoms, and is dismissive about my care. Indeed, at my last visit she failed to give me the results of an EEG that she herself had ordered, even though I brought it up. 

Dr. Ahn has failed to prescribe appropriate medication. She had me taking a high dose of medicine, even though I suggested it might be too much for someone who is relatively small and already taking a hefty dose of anti-epileptic medicine. It was only after I mentioned feeling groggy and having memory loss that it occurred to her to take it down a notch. 

Ultimately, the stuff she gave me didn't work out, as I ended up seizing anyway. She suggested we should UP MY DOSAGE, and when I declined, she looked at me like I was nuts and asked why I wanted to get off the medicine so badly.... Um, CLEARLY because it's not working??? 

Lastly, her availability is ridiculous. I chose to see her because she comes out to my area once weekly; yet, it's impossible to get an appointment because she fails to make trips out here. I've now resigned myself to making lengthy trips to the chandler office, just for the sake of being seen.

I'm now tapering off the meds that she gave me; sadly, my epilepsy has gotten worse, I have constant shaking and tremors. 

Review too long? here's all you need to know: avoid this clinic, avoid Dr. Ahn, she will only make you worse.",1
4095,I came in to customize a bikini for my girlfriend as a gift. Their customer service was top of the line! There were so many fabrics and designs to choose from! My girlfriend absolutely loved it! The employee who was helping me was really friendly and accommodating! I highly recommend this place.,5

Don't expect the waitresses to be quick.  Ours was very slow.",5

4101,this is the best chinese food in champaign. Every thing there I love the place.,5
4102,"Fantastic food and service here. I ordered a combo plate with teriyaki beef and chicken. They were out of lumpia, so if you are looking for that call ahead as they said they run out quickly!",5
4103,"Oh wow, it was amazing. First off, the view is amazing -- the restaurant is situated such that it overlooks the Bellagio fountains, head-on. There's an outdoor seating section and unfortunately we were seated right next to the door and it often got stuck - not a lot of people bothered to close it, so we had the summer heat constantly blowing on us.

Absolutely make a reservation before you come here, I think I saw them turning people away in front of me. 

We started with the caprese - absolutely delicious, but I'm probably biased because this is one of my favorite all time dishes. The dishes come out one at a time, by the time you've finished one they're usually pretty good about making sure the next one has already been placed on you time (if not the next 2).

Highly, highly recommend the burrata, we also had the cold cuts plater (because who doesn't love some dried meats?).  As far as pastas, we ordered linguine al pesto, gnocchi alla romana, funghi trifolati, and agnolotti di vitello. Other dishes ordered were polpette di carne and capasanta alla putanesca (scallops). My favorite dish was hands down the gnocchi alla romana - tasted like butter and the texture was fantastic. In all honesty, I would order any and all of the pastas again. 

I am absolutely planning to come back.",5
4104,Had lunch here yesterday and had a great experience. The blackened fish tacos were full of flavor and prepared to perfection. The menu has a wide variety of items to choose from.

Give it a try once, and you be hooked without a doubt.",5
4109,This Big O Tires is amazing.  The people that work there are all friendly and are willing to help.  I needed some major work done Casey was wonderful to explain everything to me and give me a few different price quotes.  When I went back to have the services performed Tim was wonderful to look up all the previous information and help me make the decision that best worked for my situation. Not only did they give great service they finished earlier than expected and Under the quoted price.  Because there were coupons on the website. I will definitely be back to this location.,5

4111,"Subs so slow you'll starve before they get there. This location in particular is literally only two right turns right down Mineral Point Road (less than a mile on the same street!) to my workplace, yet it is always an average of 40 minutes before I get my delivery order. How is that even possible? I could walk there faster than that. I always have to remember to order my lunch well before I'm even hungry for it. If my work was in a weird location, I guess I could understand, but we're literally right down the street from them. 

I love that JJ has online ordering but this location has to step up their game. Their ""Subs so fast you'll freak"" motto is a joke. If I could give this location less than one star, I would.",1
4112,"Seriously, this place is awesome. Their delivery range is HUGE, and they are open late, which will practically get anyone 5 stars in Gilbert when you can't get any delivery past 8pm most days. 

Their chicken wings are the best I've had in the area. Where other restaurants will sell you something dry and tough with hardly any meat to be picked from the bones, Venezia's wings are absolutely tasty. I have ordered chicken wings from them almost a dozen times at this point, and every time the quality has been consistently good: plump, juicy meat that tastes delicious and falls off the bone. I have cravings for their chicken wings. 

Their pizza is good. The crust is homemade, the sauce is good. We have only ordered the veggie and it's delicious. 

Delivery is always on time and the people are always really nice. 

We are new regulars. I have been so obsessed with the chicken wings I haven't branched out to other menu items yet. Definitely recommend, especially for delivery.",5
4116,I can't say enough good things about Dan and his team. From start to finish incredibly professional and the job done was beyond my expectations. Everything went exactly as planned and all of my questions were always answered along the way. The quality of my plants and pavers was magnificent. I requested lots of hummingbird/butterfly plants and Dan absolutely delivered! I highly recommend Epic Landscape.,5
4117,"They did a fantastic job in my car, I'm very impressed. Communication was a little off, but shit happens. They did everything they could to make sure my insurance covered the costs. I definitely recommend this place, just make sure you know exactly what your insurance covers, like with any collision center.",5
4118,"I ordered eggplant with beef and it tasted awful. Husband ordered red curry and it just tasted really bland. Service was horrible, no customer service. Will not come back.",1
4119,Amazing food!! I go here at least once a week. Love there steak bowl and baklava. Very professional and great customer service. Would recommend to anyone.,5
4120,Amazing! I am the worst when it comes to dessert reviews because I love dessert and am very picky about them.  This place was unbelievable! I got a mini red velvet and a mini chocolate peanut butter and both were so tasty! Thank God it's not closer to my house or I'd probably be there weekly.,5
4122,"Overall 5 stars:  The service was outstanding at this helicopter tour company.  The wife and I planned a helicopter ride from Las Vegas to the Grand Canyon with a champagne picnic inside of the Grand Canyon. We were picked up from our hotel in one of the company's limousines on time.  We got checked in for our tour in a timely manner also.  There was a short safety briefing and then we were off to our tour.  It was a cloudy and rainy day.  Our pilot assured us that if he thought we were in any danger he would turn around right away. We got some good looks at the strip, hoover dam, and lake mead.  As we headed over to the Grand Canyon, we got turned around because of bad weather in the Grand Canyon.  He told us that we wouldn't have been able to land in the Grand Canyon because of the weather.  We still had a great tour with a lot of sightseeing.  The pilot let us know that the company would take care of us and either reschedule or give us a refund.  When we got back to the office, they were very professional and helped us get a full refund.  We did not have too much time in Las Vegas so we couldn't reschedule. Once everything was cleared up, they gave us a ride back to our hotel in the limousine again.  We technically got a free tour.  I would like to thank Sundance for their help with everything and hopefully we can rebook our champagne picnic next time we go to Las Vegas!",5

I had my nipples done and while yes, I did take care of my piercings well I can tell you she's a great piercer bc not only did I not have any pain but I healed in less than half the time of people I know with them.  I was ready to go down a size earlier than expected.  I went back just to have her change them because I trusted her.  Great prices too because my piercer in Florida is double or triple their cost.",5

4132,"Have been going here for years, and getting...and loving the cornbread.  However, as of the 1st of the month, they started charging $3.00 for the cornbread...but neglect to mention that.

I would think if they changed the policy just a couple of weeks ago that they would now inform customers that they are charging for cornbread...which was free.",1
4133,"It took over 2h for the delivery. I called after 90 minutes and was told that it would be another 10-15 minutes. Once 20 minutes had passed, I called again and was told just another 5 minutes. When I said that the food would surely be cold when it arrives, I was just told to check the food and call them back so they could see what could be done to accommodate the issue. I was pretty dumbfounded but decided to wait. Again, once the time had elapsed, I called to cancel. I was asked to still accept the order but with a 50% rebate. I refused and was simply told thank you. 

There was absolutely no attempt by the staff to be helpful and calling only resulted in the phone being set aside while several staff members spoke before coming back to me and asking that I simply wait longer. 

Needless to say, I will never be ordering from this restaurant again.",1
4134,"Apparently this practice is run by the ""ladies"" at the front desk. When asking for one of the two head practice doctors, the ""ladies"" transferred me to a billing clerk. Ugh. Calls to my primary care physician brought no return call. (Did the doctor even get that message? I think not.) Letters to the physicians listed in the Arizona Cororation Commission's files, that showed the practice incorporated in 2005,  went unanswered. My spouse thought that knowing this about the office operation, it was best to leave their practice.  Believe it or not, it was ""these ladies"" who messed up.  After all,  they are not selling shoes and socks. They are a health care provider with human beings as their revenue source. You, me, my family and friends could be at risk with this type of goings on.

Together my spouse  and I concluded  that the doctors have no idea what is going on, and the so-called ""ladies"" may be vendictive, meaning not properly taking care of patients. Who would know?

Would you want to do business with a family medical office that seems not to care? I don't.

This post was entered in August. It is now mid October. Letters to the doctors who own the practice have gone unanswered. Is this a way to run a health care facility? Are the front desk ""ladies"" still in charge of your health? I think so. It's time to clean house.",1
4135,"Wing night is Tuesday for the ""traditional"" wings, which are the closest flavor to the ""originals"" at Frank and Teressa's Anchor Bar, you'll find anywhere. I think their special is .45 cent wings. Other specials throughout the week.

Great wings, friendly staff, nice open surroundings. It will even be nicer if smoking is banned from the bar area. Park around back, you might not see the BWW sign from the main road. I think there's an Applebee's out front you'll see first, but this place is worth searching for.

Order ""traditionals"", with a little sauce on the side, maybe some cheese (wedge) fries in case your tongue catches fire.

I don't want to sound like a (non-smoking) nut - but I'd like to leave an establishment and not take the smell of smoke with me on my clothes and what's left of my hair.

These are the best wings available from any national restraint or fast food chain. Go to the website and find the map to find the closest restaurant to you - http://www.buffalowildwings.com/

There are four in the Pittsburgh area and one in Erie. Other restaurants have opened in MD (3), NY (14), DE (3), VA (15), WV (5), NC (10), SC (4), DE (3), VA (15), TX (50+).

4137,"My boyfriend and I went here on our first night in Vegas. We stayed at the Venetian, so the location was perfect. The atmosphere is amazing--caters to young couples and groups. I ordered the Tao-tini and my boyfriend ordered the Tao-Rita for drinks. Both drinks were good, but I would recommend the Tao-tini. For appetizers we ordered the lobster wontons and crispy rice tuna. For the best food experience, definitely order the crispy rice tuna as an appetizer. For our meal, we decided to order three different sushi rolls to start out. Each roll came with 8 pieces. To our surprise, three rolls filled us up and we didn't end up ordering more. We ordered spicy tuna, crunchy spicy yellowtail, and shrimp tempura rolls. My favorite was the crunchy spicy yellowtail and my boyfriends's favorite was the spicy tuna.  Not only was the food amazing, but the atmosphere and service was too!",5

The tacos were $3.50 and they charged another $2.00 for cheese and sour cream. So it ended up being $5.50 each for nasty tacos. My wife ordered a tostada, she took 2 bites and threw the rest away. Even the kids tossed their food. The only thing that got eaten was the rice. I'd just try and avoid this place all together.",1
4144,"Great sushi, great sashimi, great rolls, great food all around.  They do have other options than what is on the conveyor belt, but why wouldn't you want to grab the fresh food that's stolling by as you sit peacefully.  

We go at least once a month.  Dinner during the week is a lot easier than anytime on the weekends or Fridays.  

Hooray for delicious food on the move! If you're not hungry, don't pull more food off the belt. Only take what you want--perfect for sharing.",5

I called on Thursday and they came out the next day! Wes was extremely friendly and professional. He is owner the of the business and you can really tell how much he cares. He spent extra time and went above and beyond spraying inside the house, outside around the foundation, and even took extra time to spray around edge of the yard/fence. I now have peace of mind that we will have less critters around, thanks to Wes.

Excellent service, top notch. I would recommend West Coast to anyone in a heartbeat.

PS - They are having a great deal right now for a great price!

Thanks so much Wes!",5

4151,"The food is freshly made to order.  The bento boxes are great. You choose your items and the variety is good. You get plenty to eat...
I wish I knew about the ALL U CAN EAT SUSHI. $20.95 for lunch and the menu is incredibly large.  Conning back tomorrow!",5
4153,"My husband and I are moving last minute, he is in the military and we were really over whelmed and worried about leaving our home. Thankfully  we found OnQ and they have been nothing but helpful, accommodating and understanding. We will be moving over seas soon and have been treated so well we know we can trust them with our home. We are so thankful to have one less thing to worry about, and excited to continue to work with them.",5
4154,"Last year when my father came to visit we tried the all you can eat crab buffet and it was delicious.  However, this past Thursday evening we stood in line for one and a half hours for the worst crab legs I have ever eaten.  There was hardly any ""meat"" and the crabs were watery.  Apparently, they were caught during the final stage of the molting cycle.  This was a huge disappointment as we were looking forward to it and I had even invited a friend.  Not to mention, a waste of an hour and a half and oh yeah, $60.00.",1

4158,"Wow being that I came from New York..this pizza is excellent! Just ordered large cheese pie to see how it was..i read some reviews first online to see what reviews were best!  You people got it right on the nose...they said 45 min. And it was 44..lol..excellent pie and Hot still
.love it..will be a returning customer for sure!!!",5
4159,"I went in here to rent a box. It was a little busy. This lady named Becky was the one behind the counter. I did not like the way she was handling the customers. She was treating them as if they are below her. People were friendly to her but it was clear she was deliberately being discourteous. After seeing this happen to a couple people, I thought about it. I'm suppose to trust her with my mail. I think not. I took my business elsewhere.",1
4160,"From Chicago.....craving a pizza puff and fries, maxwell street polish, vienna beef sand??? 
This is the place to go....Super friendly staff who go out of their way to make you feel like your back home. 
Had my fiance try a juicy vienna beef sand with mozzarella and sweet peppers (as only a true chicagoan can order) he was hooked from the first bite. I had my fix of a pizza puff, left out with a big smile. Everything was great...
They offer daily specials like free dog if your wearing a cubs jersey, etc. Support a Chicago business and give them a try, I know you won't be disappointed..",5
4163,"The Cedar Plank Salmon is by far THE best salmon I've ever had.

The C.A.B. burger is one of my top 3 favorite burgers (self-proclaimed burger critic here).

Best Lobster Mac & Cheese  I've ever had (doesn't have that strong seafood taste/flavor that a lot if seafood Mac & cheese dishes have).

Both the steak Cobb salad and strawberry chicken salad are amazing (and huge- definitely can split these)

I don't think there's a dish you could go wrong with here (except during restaurant week when they had a po-boy on the menu- was not impressed. But it was a po-boy sandwich so, you know, not that shocking)",5
4164,"Excellent place to eat! Very clean, friendly staff and yummy kosher food! The rostbeef is amazing !!!",5
4165,"Came to play pool and drink a beer. I saw lights out, carpet missing, bartenders eating behind the bar (which may have been allowed but I don't care to ever watch my server have food swishing around their mouth) and bus boys chewing on the floor as well. Thought about food because we were hungry but the food they serve is either fried or processed.",1
4166,I went here for my daughters birthday and this place was absolutely amazing! They had great service and Justin (our server) was awesome and super helpful and friendly! It has a reasonable price for some good quality sushi. Would recommend if you want to try sushi or just to eat it!,5
4167,"The staff is very knowledgeable with the AKM rifles and didn't mind showing me the different types that they have in stock and answering all of my questions.  Purchased a FIME VEPR in 7.62 and their pricing was fair, process was smooth and painless. Would definitely recommend if someone is wanting an AKM rifle. They have AR style rifles too but my experience is only with the AKM. The atmosphere is not intimidating and you won't feel like you are being an intrusion if you just want to browse.",5
4169,I have had the best experience with Master Pool Service LLC. I don't usually write reviews but Kevin was remarkable. I had  unexpected guests coming over and my pool was a disaster. It was in January so I hadn't had my pool cleaned in a while. The tiles were filthy. I called Master Pool Service LLC and Kevin the owner was in my back yard by the time we hung up. I had to leave to get items for my guest  and left. When I returned my pool was sparkling.  Thank you Kevin!,5
4170,"Love this little place! Everyone is always so friendly. All the food looks good but I've only had the falafel burger, it is amazing!",5
4171,"Started off getting baby calamari, which was amazing, some draft, Chinese beer (even more amazing), and the pesto crusted salmon. Only complaint is that I didn't have enough room for dessert. My server Cassie was very knowledgable and provided excellent service. Definitely coming back!",5
4172,"I really like JJ usually their CS is great and I never have any issues. I recently went in and only purchased a child size smoothie $4 for my 3 year old. We patiently waited my daughter was so excited until he handed her the MINI and I mean mini but it was literally nothing. Honestly before we got out of the parking lot (the light @ lowes) she was done. Never again I'm not sure why the cashier wouldn't tell me prior to purchasing how ""mini"" it was and show the cup compared to a small cup. I won't be back! I felt like it was a joke and to spend $4 on a swallow was ridiculous!",1
4173,"Lovely place, clean and great therapists. Owned by a very nice husband and wife team.",5
4175,"Aloha Snow is honestly my new favorite place in Charlotte - it may be a drive from Uptown, but what a welcomed experience. 

The owner is standing behind the counter ready to serve you with not only a smile but a story - she is so full of joy that you will leave happy even if you left empty handed...BUT you won't - you will leave with the best snow cone in Charlotte and a broad smile across your face to wear the whole way home!

I had cake batter and home made ice cream in my stuffed snowball - it was seriously amazing! You have to check this place out - you will want to return again and again!",5
4178,"Pretty Gross, this will be the first of the saturated 7st corridor restaurants to close.

I ordered the chicharrones and I wouldn't have been surprised if I found out that they sent a busboy over to circle k to buy them.

Guacamole was completely bland.

I'll stick to Comedor Guadalajara.",1
4179,"Amazing service, absolutely fresh tasty, healthy food ! I would recommend million times ! 
I live in the same neighborhood and I'm happy Gravina is only steps from home :)) Since we went first time, we go there regularly .",5
4180,"This place knocked me out.

I had garlic naan and the lamb Shahajahani.  The sauce was so good, I used all the naan to sop it up.  (The waiter told me it was OK to do that.  Not sure if it really was, but I don't care.  I wasn't gonna leave any.)

I travel a lot, and enjoy finding little places like this that are inconspicuous, where you can get great food, great service at a really decent price.  I had what I described above, plus a half-carafe of their house wine (not spectacular, but who cares) for $29, tip included.  And it was a good tip.

The server was very friendly and helpful and took time to help select the best choice for what I was in the mood for. And, he thanked me about six times for coming in, which was really refreshing.

This beats Indian I've had in Boston, New York and Berlin.  Will definitely be back on next trip to Pittsburgh.",5
4182,"Tam and Kim assisted us with the sale of our home, I felt very comfortable and confident that every (T) was crossed and (I) was dotted. They were both there to answer every question I had, and I'm a pretty inquisitive person ! I can't thank them enough for their professionalism and their dedication to us through a non typical transaction! 

Having had many Real Estate transactions over the years, their care and response is definitely not a typical experience. So my opinion is ... do yourself a favor, use a team that cares and is there for you at every turn, Real Estate transactions are stressful enough, having this team was our blessing !",5
4186,"I came here thinking that this place was somehow affiliated with Firemen, like the dentist was a retired first responder or something...turns out he just admires Firemen which is why he decorates his office and building like a firehouse.  The irony is that he is anything but admirable.  I guarantee everyone that walks through his door gets an overpriced ""treatment plan"" even if they are simply coming in for a cleaning.  I came in for a cleaning and was told I needed a lot of work done, including replacing my back crown that was less than 2 years old.  I told him no way and once I left I never returned.  Funny, I go to the dentist every 6 months and my new dentist has never made mention of any of the problems this dentist conjured up.  OH...and I was already upset because they had just done a number on my fiance, (but he can leave his own review) and when I went into the back room they told me they would like me to reschedule because I was in a bad mood.  I laughed and told them I don't think so, I have been waiting for 45 minutes you can see me now. I said I wanted to speak with the manager after I was seen because we needed to get the issues with my fiance's account resolved and they assured me that I could....conveniently when my appointment was over, the manager was ""out to lunch"". Don't waste your time on this place.",1
4187,"Short version: outstanding change of pace for lunch downtown.

I've been wanting to check out this place since they opened, and finally dropped in today after a lunchtime walk around the Point and back through Market Square. Very glad I did, and I'll definitely be back. I had the ""Liquid Oxygen"" (apple, beet, carrot, ginger, cayenne), and it's a perfect afternoon energizer -- no need to fear the 2:00 pm carbo crash.

At $7.44 (incl. tax) for 16 oz., it's not cheap, but the ingredients are pure, flavorful & concentrated, so you can easily stretch it out with ice in a larger cup.  I tried this with mine, and it didn't taste watered down at all.  It lasted almost an hour in an insulated mug on my desk -- good to the last drop.

The barista (""juice-ista""?) asked if I wanted a big or little piece of ginger root -- go with the big piece to wake up your tastebuds.  Fortune favors the bold!",5
4188,DO NOT USE! Purchased and made appointment through online appointment. They were suppose to show up at 9am. They called at 10:30am and said they were finishing up another job and wanted to see if I would reschedule because someone had just randomly contacted them and wanted a cleaning. I indicated I could not reschedule.  They showed up and walked around and tried to upsell the acid cleaning. I declined the acid and he said okay and said he was going back to the truck to get the hoses to start and then just got in the truck and LEFT!  Terrible company and customer service. Disappointing that Living Social does business with companies like this. I called their customer service line and left a message of course with no response. I called the tech mobile that had called me earlier and of course he doesn't answer.,1
4189,"This place has the potential to be an awesome bar.  Sadly after a few times being there i honestly don't think it would get better. I do give props to 1 bartender but that's about it. As far as music and drinks it's very mediocre, the service from the ""servers"" is extremely horrible. God for bid they'd actually have to pay attention to their customers.  I rarely do  reviews for bars but i feel like I'd have to get it out some way because it was obvious that my server being rude and inattentive was not going to get noticed by the manager. After getting a pool table and waiting a good 30 mins to get food and drink order our server finally came. Placed our drink and food order and completely rushed it out of us as if she had a time limit to get the order in ""10 pm on Friday"". When we finally got our food we realized she forgot our nachos after finishing all of our food. We told her she forgot our nachos thinking maybe it was already made and she can just run it to us but she just went and put the order in. And before that i asked for  simple glass of water she looked at me dead in the eye and said ""sure I'll grab that"", but then continued to go sit at her own table with co workers to eat and dance to the god awful music they had playing. I really wanted to like this place because of the amount of pool tables they have but the servers could use a whole lot of common sense and training.",1
4190,"I absolutely LOVE this nail salon . I go every two weeks for a manicure and pedicure .
I have been going for years and have NEVER been dissapointed 
. David and Rosie and the enire team ( love Tina ! ) both treat all their customers like family and make you feel so welcome .
The work is inpecadable , the salon clean.. My only regret is I can't go every week .",5
4191,"I walked in and I was created with a smile friendly staff.  I told the staff I was ready and she handed me the paperwork to fill out.  I did.  

I was brought back to the chair and the dentist greater me and made a point to shack my hand.   (Point for that). She asked about my history and why I was changing dentist.  I told her.   She went over my teeth and made a couple of suggestions and told me my teeth were very good but I should floss,  come in more ect.  

The best part and what would always stick in my head is her chair.  It give me a message and it felt good I did not want to leave the chair and if it was for her hands in my mouth I could have.   ( double points for the chair).  

In short I think I found my new spot to get my teeth clean when I have the cash.    If you do go mention my name.",5

4195,"really great stuff. the sides are really big and delicious, steak is top notch. the bread the start you off with is melt in your mouth good, try not to eat too much, the portions here are very big. the lobster bisque and the french onion soup are awesome. there is a server named sue she is the best!",5
4196,Little Saigon is the best Vietnamese food I've had in the Phoenix area.  The restaurant is family owned and the food is great.  I suggest the Rice Vermicelli with grilled pork and shrimp.,5
4197,First time at one of these chains. the atmosphere was cool the service was great the Drinks Alone deserve the 5-star rating. We had the drink that they make in the pineapple and it was awesome! coconut shrimp was delicious as well the main courses were good too,5
4199,"Cleveland Tiffin serves fresh, homemade indian food that is both tasty and healthy. Forget the cream laden curries filled with bad calories you get served at most indian restaurants and welcome to authentic food from the kitchen of an Indian mother. I love both styles of Indian food and each has its' time/place to be enjoyed. I got the bangain bartha (eggplant) and saag paneer (spinach cheese). Both were delicious and well spiced.

Cleveland Tiffin is truly a hole-in-the-wall. Located in a desolate, nondescript complex, the interior of the place is unfinished with cheesy art pieces on the wall. Old school bollywood music playing transported me to the '90s. There are a few tables, but takeout food is the entire business. You come here for the quality of food and nothing else.

I spoke briefly with the owner of Tiffin. He mentioned they are looking to launch a food truck in Cleveland next summer. Fingers crossed, would be a welcome addition to the scene!",5
4203,My experience here was second to none. The course of action and products given to me by Toni have done absolute wonders for my skin and my face has never looked better! The best part about it all is that you can tell she genuinely cares about her clients. She thoroughly took the time to explain each product and the regiment to me so I understood it very clearly. I'll never trust anyone else with my skin again!,5
4204,"The vegan cupcakes satisfy my sweet tooth!
Very yummy!
(They have several options to choose from)

Their vegan pizza is pretty good too!",5
4206,"Amazing food, amazing decor, love the hot bread. Friendly staff. 

Very expensive! If I can afford it I will return.",5
4208,"I love Flower City! They have the best selection of pipes, papers and smoke related things. They also have the best selection of gifts. Any time I need something for the person who has it all, I go there! No need to go to Asia for cool gifts. They have it all.",5
4209,"I felt like I was scammed by their service department. I made a reservation to bring my car in for repair. Upon arriving, I was then notified of a $132 diagnosis fee. Sinc I was stuck and needed to get my car fixed, I reluctantly agreed. After a couple a couple hours, I received a repair quote that was 2x what others quoted me. After declining the service, I paid the high diagnosis fee plus a ""supplies"" charge that no one could explain. They just said ""the computer adds it in and it can't be removed"". I feel Chapman Mazda service just wants their diagnosis fee and doesn't care about customer retention. Oh, by the way. My car is 12 years old. Chances are good I'll be buying a replacement soon. Zero chance I'll be buying from Chapman. They can just survive off their ridiculously high diagnosis fees.",1
4210,"Ew, ew, ew, EW! Ordered $36 worth of food to-go only to find green eggs in my son's deluxe french toast. My hot pastrami sandwich-well, the meat was rainbowed and tasted like the smell of a port-o-potty. My mom said her mushroom Swiss burger was fine, likely due to the burger patty being frozen. Really disappointed this restaurant is the worst I've ever tried to eat at. Had high hopes this would be a new place to take my family since we live right around the corner. But never again.",1
4212,Great and attentive staff! Food comes out hot and full of flavor. I've tried breakfast lunch and dinner and they're all equally good!,5
4215,Lovely place to read a book and drink a coffee. The baristas know their **** about drinks!,5
4217,Mayra is absolutely great and services work!!!! Encourage all to try! There are so many services available to make you look and feel bedazzled! Great place to relax,5
4218,"This is hands down my favorite place in town. Such a unique little store, I could spend hours browsing.",5
4220,Creole food would never be my 1st choice of restaurants to go to. I have heard that Lola's shrimp & grits was to die for. I love shrimp and I like grits... so I finally went to their Summerlin location.  Soooo good!  WILL DEFINITELY go back!,5
4221,"This is my favorite local bar around this area. From the looks on the outside, you may be a little hesitant to come inside but don't let that fool you. They have a great happy hour menu along with tons of beers to satisfy your belly. The food is fantastic as well and I've tried pretty much everything on the menu. It's a perfect place to watch any sports event since they are a sports bar lol. So come on down to Rebel Republic and have a drink or two with locals instead of paying those high Strip prices.",5
4222,The wait is crazy so use the No Wait app to get in line without being there. But the food is AMAZING! must get the pork tacos,5
4224,"Stopped here for some to go on my way home (Tucson) last night. Was not impressed. Salad was skimpy, they forgot to give me my dressing Tomato soup was extremely sweet.  The only thing I liked was the infused water.",1
4225,"I LOVE THIS COFFEE SHOP!!!

I am impressed with Sunrise Coffee for so many reasons, but mainly because they are doing RIGHT what so many other coffee shops fail to do: An EXCELLENT cup of coffee!!! 

It's been my mission to find authentic, handcrafted espresso drinks in Vegas, and I have finally found it in Sunrise. It's my only ""go to"" coffee shop from here on out, I don't care that it's across town, it's more than worth it. It's so perfect, reminds me of the great coffee houses of Northern California and the Pacific Northwest, but on a smaller scale. It's very clean and modern, the employees were friendly and had a refreshing attitude. Their espresso is the best I've had in Las Vegas, and it's close to the airport and has a drive thru! 

So crazy in love with this place. WOW!!!",5
4227,"The food here is amazing!!! Especially the pepper steak. The fried rice that comes with the meal is a little dry, so I would always switch it out to the white rice. Their crab puffs and dumplings are excellent too.",5
4229,"Don and John and crew have worked on my Audi (many times) and my daughter's Honda CR-V (once, so far.)  I'm an engineer and something of a car nut and when younger did just about every small job myself (brakes, water pumps, etc.) so I can follow most of what they tell me.  I have found them to be honest and trustworthy and recommend their shop without hesitation.

My Audi had a recurring issue centered on the secondary air injection system causing the CEL (Check Engine Light) to come on and preventing me from obtaining my annual state inspection. I replaced the electrical air pump myself once, only to find that the problem came back. Import Connection not only fixed it for a reasonable price but when it failed again under warranty a few months later, they replaced it again. 

Next they did my timing belt and other major maintenance (90k miles) for about half the price of the dealer.

My daughter's Honda also had the dreaded CEL (code P42.)  I replaced one of the O2 sensors myself but it didn't cure the problem.  Import Connection measured the air/fuel ratio and found it was way out of spec. The fix was a valve adjustment job ($260) which corrected the air/fuel mix and the cured the CEL problem. 

Again, if you're looking for an honest shop I think you'll be happy with this one.  As always, do your homework first and get second opinions. I think you'll come back here though. I hope that I won't have to go back soon, but will if I can't do it myself!",5
4232,"Great place for lunch and brunch at the very least (have yet to try dinner and dessert ). Definitely not one of those caf√©s serving ""bland food"". 

Had their fusion burger crepe (burger was juicy and the mix of spices was perfect) followed by green tea Sahara mint drink.  Will definitely revisit them.",5
4233,"I purchased a Groupon coupon for 2 dozen cakepops a couple of months ago, otherwise I would have never traveled all the way out to Markham. 

The cake pops were AMAZING.
Melt in your mouth heaven. I tried to make them a few times, all of which were giant failures, so I have a special appreciation for these little balls of yummy.  My 2 dozen, preordred cake pops included chocolate, red velvet and vanilla. I actually loved them all. The outside layer were dipped in vanilla or chocolate, with a variety of cute decorations on top including little pink & red hearts, little confetti sprinkles. 
5/5

While I was there, I got lured in by the cupcakes. YUM.
They were all cleanly decorated with icing. I got 6 cupcakes for $13. 
The price was very reasonable. 
I picked out chocolate, 
mango - I think this is my fav. The cupcake itself was super moist, and had a light flavor of mango through it.  YUM YUM YUM! 
Green Tea - **haven't tried yet. 
vanilla -  Classic vanilla taste, light and fluffy cupcake. 
and Taro -- I'd never heard of taro before, and girl who worked told me it was a popular flavor in the Asian culture and compared it to the taste of a yam/sweet potato? I haven't tried it yet ...  The icing is light purple. 

The icing on all of the cupcakes was very light, and not terribly sweet. Very creamy, and slighty oily on the tongue. One of the best icings I've ever had. 

These cupcakes exceeded my expectations. And I'd probably drive to Markham again to get them. That says a lot! ;)",5
4234,"Haven't been in years and so happy to be here. Brought my kid on a Friday, PA day, and we are having a great time. We started in the middle since we didn't get here until 11AM.

Great to find a shop that is patient and really tries to explain the services they're suggestion and the possible problems you ma be in store for in the moth short and long term. Can't complain. The prices are affordable. Great customer service. Overall pleased with this place.",5
4240,Incredible food. Great service very helpful ordering the right entre. The flavor of everything was fabulous. I highly recommend this restaurant. Wish they had alcohol but no big deal the food out ways the drink,5
4241,"Awful. Especially the night shift staff. 

Sat in the drive thru for 30 minutes after a 16 hour shift and all I wanted was an egg mcmuffin. 

They told me to pull ahead and then forgot about me. I literally had to call the store to ask for a refund because their lobby was closed even tho they claim to be a 24 hour location. 

Just terrible service. Completely incompetent.",1
4244,"Based on Yelp reviews, I decided on Piestewa Peak as my first hike in Arizona and absolutely loved it!  I was looking for cardio with a beautiful view and that is exactly what I got!

I went solo on Easter Sunday and was pleased that quite a few fellow hikers joined me on my mission to take on the Summitt.  In my experience I found parking to be a breeze.  The people were all friendly and the people watching was hilarious.  

Be sure to bring plenty of water since it really is a trek and if you can fit it, bring your camera-it is worth the extra effort!",5
4246,"This is about as gross as you can get.... it smells horrible and utterly  flithy. AVOID THIS HOTEL!  But seriously,  it smells disgusting and it's nauseating. Another tragic feature or lack of feature is that there are no curtains to close when you want to sleep or undress. The entire parking lot can see into your room.  Sadly,  there was a street light right outside of my window that was shining in my room and it was really hard to sleep (see pic).",1
4248,"My cousin told me about National Fresh Foods and Experience. Since my first discovery a few months ago, I came back here almost every other week.  My children like the sushi there because it is fresh, but not pricey.  My husband likes the Dim Sum there, so I ordered take out a few times for my family and guests.  My youngest son likes some of their baked goods, too.

I like the meat, seafood, and produce departments. They have so may choices when it comes to Asian foods.  They also carry some tropical fruits which are not easy to find in the regular Canadian market.  Sometimes, they have exceptionally good deals in meat and produce departments.  I rarely leave the place without filling up my two huge Costco bags!  So guilty being a big spender at the Asian super market! lol",5
4250,My friend and I are both chefs and just got off work and my friend who WAS a loyal customer for 6 years recommend we go here for dinner. I was early and the service was great I got a drink and my chips very fast. Once my friends got there we ordered margaritas with an extra shot and they tasted like lime-ade not 1 drop of tequila so we sent it back. Once we received our margaritas again nothing changed it we couldn't taste any tequila. We ordered our dinner and it took forever to come out literally about 30 to 40 minutes we went through atleast 5 bowls of chips and dip. The buster Oscar was the ONLY reason we didn't get up and leave and he is the only reason this place is getting 1 star. Oscar was very engaging and entertaining he made us laugh and made our whole night! Once our food came I got the tacos de carne asada and it literally had no flavor or seasoning it tasted like I was chewing rubber I had to put guac and ton of salt I even dug in my margarita to get my lime to give it some taste. We were highly disappointed and to top it off my friend who is retired military and has been getting a military discount for the last 6 years they refused to give it to her because she wasn't currently active duty! We complained to the manager and he wasn't the most friendly or considerate of all managers wasn't much help at all he did reluctantly give us a military discount. The food was mediocre the service was decent the management was horrible I'd rather spend my money on taco bell... but Oscar is amazing that's the only good thing about this place... I will not be coming back and I doubt my friends will either,1

We all had something different, and everyone was impressed with the taste and quality of food.  Happy Hour Drinks were perfect, and a great price compared to most places.  We will be back!",5
4252,"Consistently good food, very affordable, lots of variety.  I especially like their egg rolls (hard to find good ones in C-U.)  Bo will remember you after a couple of times, too.  He can even remember if you don't like green peppers, usually order the orange chicken, etc.  Hidden in a little strip mall by Culver's, I think it is one of Champaign's hidden secrets.",5

You would have thought it was crack the way two employees pushed the Philips cordless on me hard saying that is was the cream of the crop, that I would never experience interference between this phone and other signals, yadda, yadda, yadda. I didn't have time to do my usual two months and 12 days of research so I went for it. It turned out to be a terrible purchase. We had the phone a few weeks before hooking it up, immediately experienced problems with...wait for it...interference, and struggled with it for about two weeks before attempting to return it. This time around Mr. and Mrs. Helpful Radio Shack Employee were not so much so, refusing to take it back b/c it was past 30 days.

4264,Did the hike via Echo trail and loved it! Make sure you have PLENTY of water and it's not mid day. It gets miserably hot quick!,5
4266,"A diamond in the rough.  Everything about this place is 5 stars.  Service, food quality, price, originality.  My wife and i are picky foodies and we go about once a week here.",5
4267,"I've been to Midtown Endocrine a dozen times and have always had fantastic results. The online system is excellent, where you can see your appointment, medications, test results, etc. 

The staff is caring, competent and trustworthy. Laura, up front, is efficient and pleasant. Dr. Edling and her PA Paige are top notch. I've been to three endocrinologists in the valley and now wished I'd been coming here all along. 

I've recommended MEA to several people and they have all thanked me afterwards. 

I highly recommend Midtown Endocrine Associates for their professionalism, caring attitude and efficient care.",5
4268,"Very disappointed that I nearly was tossed by management tonight when some details gentleman (lack of a better term) decided that he would tell me that the next time I spoke positively of President Trump he would ""drag me outside and beat my ass!""

I immediately told him to be seated and hollered loudly for security!  When none came to my need.  I began hollering for management!  The next thing I know, it is me who is being threatened to be tossed.  Wow!!!

Someone with a disability who had been attacked is the person viewed as the aggressor.  What a horrendous world we live in these days.  

I was fortunate that the Casino Manager, Michael, came down and asked me about what took place.  Something nobody else had done.   I'm grateful for Mr. Michael, but the rest were a struggle.  

We will be reconsidering whether or not we will return again in the future.",1
4270,Hands down the best group of sushi Chiefs I've ever met. Ken (the owner) and Ace are just amazing. They take the time to talk to you and get to know you if you sit at the sushi bar. My boyfriend and I have become regulars here and I don't plan on going to any other place. They are absolutely amazing!,5
4273,I have been to other EWC locations but my boyfriend wanted to try this location out. The front desk staff were very nice and had personality. My boyfriend's waxer was very cool and took her time. She didn't rush through the 2 services. This location is located in Dana Park and is busy so I recommend calling ahead and making an appointment.,5
4275,"First time here and I think it's lovely. I work around this area and want to keep coming back. The staff was friendly and welcoming. They keep the place clean and it's just a calming environment. I got the sandwich and salad combo and it was delicious! 
:) ....I wonder how tasty their breakfast items are.",5
4276,"I stay here every time I'm in town and love the property. I always upgrade my room and the view doesn't disappoint. I love being able to avoid the hastle of being on strip while still being right by the strip. And I've never had anything but positive experiences with the staff when I need them for something. 

I'll keep coming back!",5
4279,"The food was delicious and it was crazy fast!! Our waitress was very fun and nice!  Very good customer service and energy from the workers. Plus, all day happy hour Monday thru Thursday and Friday thru Sunday 3-6pm :)",5
4281,I can not believe i have been here 5 years and today was my first time.  It was great. I have nothing else. Must stop in Cave Creek,5
4282,"I had a nose job, breast aug, and tummy tuck maybe dr. hankins wasnt having a a good day but all 3 came out like crap! my nose is worse than before, my breast one is in the correct spot but my left is practically in my arm pit, i can barely put my arm down. my nose was supposed to have been reduced and i have no idea what he did but its bigger and now the tip droops down like gonzo from the muppets. my tummy tuck is crooked and hideous the scar is not diminishing at all and i cant  wear short shirts or low cut jeans, one side looks great in low cut jeans but the other side starts to show cuz its like a zig zag scar starts on my lower hip but the other side comes up over my other hip so it looks so stupid i shoulda kept my old nose boobs and tummy i regret having it done wish i had my 17,000 $ back :(  -dont go to him or dr sohn he did my smart lipo on my saddle bags i wore my spandex thing and massaged my legs a few times a day and it is still lumpy and bumpy its so humiliating i am too embarassed to let my man see me naked or have sex with the light on or during the day.",1
4283,"I recently moved to SC. The first time I went to iColor I was very satisfied. I moved to Rock Hill and this salon is 30+ minutes from me and I needed a fill badly, so unfortunately I went to another salon closer to me. After having a terrible experience I will now drive 30+ minutes to get my nails done at iColor! The staff are very friendly and tend to your every need.",5
4285,My family and I have been going here for about 3-4 years and we absolutely love it. We get the same things every time (despite the increase in prices due to popularity). Staff pretty much know what we want by heart lol and they always recognize us when we stop by. They're friendly and considerate + getting your food never takes too long. I can't even think of a time they ever got our order wrong and it's a pretty large order considering my family's size! They're overall a great place and we always recommend them whenever anyone ask about local Thai food!,5
4286,Was my first time in today and even tho it was crazy busy what do you expect on opening day. Best thing ive ever tasted. So glad it is right next to my work. I'll be visiting alot.,5
4287,I had some alterations done to my suit at Katrine's and it fit perfectly after. Also their drycleaning is impeccable and fast. I would definitely recommend their business.,5
4288,Best authentic Thai restaurant!!  I am from NY and my husband is from DC and has been to Thailand many times and we can say- without question- that this is the best Thai restaurant in the valley!! The spring rolls were some of the best I have ever had anywhere! I then had the chicken noodle soup and my husband had the duck noodle soup and we loved it. We finished with fried bananas and coconut ice cream which was the perfect end to a magnificent meal. We will be back.,5
4289,"Always a pleasure to have Daisy Carpet Cleaners come out and clean our carpets. The dental office I work at has been using them for years and I've used them at my home as well. The owner Joe is great! He's always friendly and professional. Plus, they're very quick and efficient. Highly recommend using them if you need your carpets cleaned!",5
4291,"Flipping love this place!  Try the 4 taco combo...it comes with 4 street tacos of your choice, 2 sides and a drink.  Perfect for 2 people to split.  The whole meal cost about $10.  Really reasonable and the food is SO good!  

I've tried the Carne Asada...wonderful!  So tender and delicious!  The Texacano is definitely worth trying!  Again, so tender and delicious!  I've also tried their chicken curry option called the Bombay, which was good.  The Pollo is very good too.  Their chips and salsa are so tasty!  The chips and salsa taste and look homemade.  I haven't tried any other sides but am planning on it for my next visit!

I will without a doubt be back!",5
4294,"All the seafood with out the long wait at the big hotel on the strip. The crab is good and the sushi/sashimi was good as well. Definitely glad I went here during my stay in Vegas. Kinda pricey when I went on a Sunday, about $30 a person.",5
4295,Justin worked with me for probably a month prior to getting into the dealership and was patient with my schedule. After meeting him and making a deal with him I left with a great experience and will be back.,5
4296,"Chicken cobb sandwich was AMAZING. From the description it sounds like it would be a salty, sloppy mess but it absolutely is not. There is the perfect amount of everything.

the Italian bread held up like a champion to all the ingredients, without losing an ounce of its delicious integrity.

It honestly reminded me a lot of Panera Bread, but cheaper and better.

the Italian wedding soup was also fantastic. nice and simple, with plenty of meatballs but not too much or too little of everything.

We ordered from grubhub. Upon delivery the soup was still hot and the sandwich still cold. It made a fantastic lunch. Will definitely order again!",5
4297,I locked my keys in a new Condo and was mad because of past experiences with locksmiths. Called Jeff and was quoted a discounted cash price over the phone which is rare for this business. Was quoted arrival in less than half an hour and he showed up early. Did the paperwork and opened it up very quickly. Expected him to tell me it was a difficult lock and that it would be double the price. But he asked for exactly what he quoted on the phone! What?!? An honest locksmith? Amazing! Thank you Jeff! 5 stars!!,5
4298,This was by far one of the coolest and most fun bars I have been to. Between the great selection of craft beers from all over the place to the out door games its a great place to hang out. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to go out and do something different instead of sitting in a boring dark bar.,5
4299,"Wonderful evening! The food was fabulous, the service was great! May I suggest the 4lb steak special?",5
4301,"The Vdara Is one of my favorite hotels when I visit Vegas. They are a Non-smoking Non-Gaming property owned by the MGM Group and I prefer to this hotel for a couple reasons. While most people go to Vegas to go crazy and unleash, I prefer to unwind and the Vdara is comfortable and allows its guests to go out for fun or have a good time but come back to a calm and peaceful enviroment to rest. The rooms here are beautiful and offer great rates in comparison to other Vegas hotels rates'. The beds are comfortable, the rooms are spacious and the property is quiet. You don't have to worry about being woken up all night long by loud music or deal with drunk people passed outside the door to your room because this hotel, while not the most expensive, Is simply classy and they offer great amenities, and services. This property offers awesome customer service, a great location, and modern touches which are overlooked or simply outdated at many of the older properties.",5
4302,Chinese people cooks Pho ? WTH ... gimme a break lolz. Went here on my New Year holidays and was craving for something hot like Pho but was disappointed =( . The broth was taste less. The stir fried noddles was nasty. Won't come back here. Do not come if you want some good Pho. Go somewhere else =),1
4303,Our favorite Mexican restaurant around! We always try something new and we love everything we have tried!!,5
4304,I have had a great experience every time I have come to this Dairy Queen! Everyone is so helpful if I want to try something new or when I get my usual!  I've been coming here for years because I live around the corner and they never dissappoint!,5
4305,This location is close to my house.  I can call in an order and pick it up on my way home from work.  My favorites are the meatball sub and the cheese steak.  The staff have been consistently courteous and efficient.  The store has been consistently clean in the dining area.  The high counter tops make it impossible for me to see the cooking area apart from what is visible by the cash register.  This location is attached to the convenience store; which also has a mini USPS and gas station.  There is outside seating with umbrellas as well as the indoor dining area.  I cannot recall if there is a television for customers to watch as my food orders have always been take out.,5
4306,"I highly recommend Dave for dent repair. Fast, courteous and excellent repair skills sums it up. Dave even used a few techniques that I've never seen anyone use to make sure the dent looked like it never existed! I hope I don't get any more dents but if I do, Dave is the only guy I'd use.",5
4310,"Third Federal started out nice, polite, expounded to my calls, and followed through until they got to the point of telling me they would not meet the %age quoted.  Then, they did not follow through, said I'd have to wait for a couple of weeks until a new program came out which would still give me my original 4.8%.  Several weeks later, the rate when to 6.2%, higher than my current rate, and an interest only loan, and a $paydown to get that loan.  They are not reliable, trustworthy, honest.  In addition, their flyer says that If I opened a mortgage with them b4 Oct 11, 2017 I would get a $100 gift card for Home Depot.  Guess what???  No gift card!!!!  They said I had to close the mortgage to get it.  The FLYER DOES NOT SAY THAT.  It says ""must originate mortgage to get gift card.""  The definition of ""Originate"" is to initiate, to begin, etc., etc.  DO NOT start a loan with them.",1
4311,"I always come here for pedicures and gel manicures. Everyone is so friendly! They've always had great service. Jennifer, Long, Monica, and another young girl I forget the name of are always so kind to me. They are very clean and I only trust them for my pedicures. I always get a simple cute flower design on my toes and they do an amazing job. I have no complaints about this place, they are the only east side nail shop I trust year after year. The best part is their shop does not have a strong chemical smell! I love it",5
4312,Why do amazing restaurants like this only exist on the left coast?!? Visiting my parents from the Midwest and was blown away by this great fast casual restaurant. Had the ahi tuna appetizer with the cilantro jalape√±o hummus. Amazing. My son and mom had chicken pitas and raved. The only mediocre item was the side of rice and beans which was just eh. Still can't wait to go back!,5
4315,"I pulled up at exactly 6PM (closing) on a Friday with a flat tire. DJ in service stayed late, after they officially closed, to get me written up.  He somehow squeezed me in, patched my tire, washed the car and had me on my way by late morning on Saturday.  Amazing service.  Thanks DJ. Will be back for sure.",5
4316,"I have been using this office for years and it has been going downhill for the last two. Their billing staff is useless and constantly getting the billing codes mixed up. My wife spent over an hour explaining that they coded my sons shot visit as a well check and it wasn't covered by our insurance. When we told them that we switched insurance in April and gave them copies of the cards at that time, they never updated their records. Then they told us that we now have to pay $50.00 per visit towards a potential bill because they have people who don't pay. When we explained that they can't do that per our insurance coverage we were told and I quote"" we don't care. It's our policy"". Avoid this doctor unless you enjoy over paying for bad customer service.",1
4317,This is a wonderful place! First of all they allow you to pre purchase pending coffee for people in need and I'll continue to be a patron because of that PLUS it's the only place around that I've found that does this. The menu is not large but what I had was fabulous! The people are terrific and welcoming. I met a nice couple moving into the area and we chatted for most of the time I was there. The people who work there are helpful and simply lovely. I highly recommend Mama's!,5
4318,Wow!! One of the best breakfast dishes I ever had. I had the Apple Tempura pancakes and coffee. This dish is to die for. Very decadent but so worth it. I was full until dinner after a 7:30AM breakfast which is not like me. LOL. Also very good coffee. I will be back soon. I look forward to trying other things on the menu.,5
4319,This is my new favorite bike shop!!! I brought in my bike that had gotten damaged from my move looking like a mess;  coming out of the shop it was shiny and new again!!! Excellent customer service and friendly staff are located inside this store! Don't go anywhere else!!!,5
4321,The best place to get a pedi in Ballantyne! Super clean and sanitary.  I've only had good experiences here!,5
4322,VERY helpful staff. Groupon made it very affordable. We had a tremendous time. Even for novice!!,5
4323,"Blink and you'll miss this wonderful eatery. 
Such amazing Pakistani/Indian food!
I had tandoori lamb chops with Afghani rice and it was to die for. 
I stole some of my mom's chicken kabab (#18 is the only thing I remember about the name of the dish) and it was melt-in-your-mouth delectable. 

The staff is super friendly and our server even recommended a wonderfully refreshing yet slightly spicy green sauce to go with my lamb, which I appreciated that he took the extra time to make sure my meal tasted the best it could. 

I'd recommend this to anybody and their mother (mine included. haha).",5
4325,"We booked at the Monte Carlo and stayed at their new hotel addition which is the Park MGM. Dustin checked us in and he was very welcoming and professional. His badge didn't have a last name but it said he was originally from Pomona, CA. The hotel has check-in monitors, but Dustin was more than happy to help us personally check in. I have allergies and I was happy to find out they have a ""Stay Well"" floor designated with features that allow you to have  a pleasant night . It includes Aromatherapy, Air Purification System, Vitamin C Infused shower and the best part a $4,000 stay well Mattress. They actually have a stay well website which has items from the room you can purchase for your house, that's when I foundl out the price. I slept soooo good it did feel like it's worth $4,000. The room also has a special lighting which you can change the settings in this ""mood box"". I took plenty of pictures to make sure everyone gets to see how awesome this hotel is. It's also at a very convenient location where it's connected to Hotel Aria and it has access to the ""tram"". Other than that it's walking distance to many things surrounding the Las Vegas strip.",5
4327,One of the best Mexican lunches I've had. Their fajitas are huge. Good service as well. The spinach chips is to die for.,5
4330,"This place was recommended by a soon to be non-friend. 

Portions were small, prices were big, taste was average, server was uninterested borderline annoyed, nothing to write home about. I won't be back. Nuf said!",1
4331,Great Service!!!! Paula did my nails. She did a fantastic job! I will definitely be back again! I would recommend getting your nails done there. The shop is very clean and you receive complementary beverages!,5
4332,"READ BEFORE THINKING ABOUT RENTING HERE!

My fiance and I signed for a 9 month lease, at $1300 a month PLUS utilities for a 2bd/2bth. ( We didn't have time to look anywhere else unfortunately ) When we moved in there was a few issues, extremely loud and obviously defective garbage disposal, which the brilliant staff said theirs did the same thing and it was normal, the extremely loud air conditioning unit was also something their apartment did. For as much as we were paying we should've at least expected a parking spot at night time, good luck finding a parking spot even with your ""parking pass"". We had multiple incidents where management/maintenance let themselves into our apartment without notice. I called and complained that they entered without a heads up, and sure enough a few weeks later there was another time where we found out they entered without letting us know. We were told we got new floors, freshly renovated but it was filthy when we moved in. Weird they would renovated with used items? The gates never work, you're either locked in or locked out. This was really just a lesson learned for us, I highly highly suggest you look at other options before choosing The Fairways at Southern Highlands. I would not recommend any of my friends/family ever stay there. As for management at this location, pay close attention to them trying to take advantage of you any chance they get.",1
4333,Was able to have my battery replaced while I waited without an appointment- since dead batteries don't come with an advance warning,5
4334,"We stayed at the Cosmopolitan over the holidays. Great spacious suite with a fabulous view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains from the nice terrace. Love the huge bathroom with large shower and soaking tub. We ate at the Wicked Spoon buffet, Holsteins, The Juice Bar, and Starbucks. I'll review these separately. Love that the hotel is next to the Shops at Crystals and Aria Hotel and Casino. The decor is modern and there is unique art everywhere. We had a private bedroom and a living area with a sofa bed and a mini kitchen. They also have an ice rink during the winter. I would definitely stay here again.",5
4335,"Brewers Connection is without a doubt my favorite homebrew shop. This place has been around since 1993. Talk about being down for the cause!  I've been coming here since 2010 and always get great, knowledgeable service. Crushed grains are double bagged and sealed, which is really great if you have to postpone your brew session for a couple days or a week. The liquid yeast is always fresh and handled properly. Killer hop selection. All the equipment you could possibly need. You'll find everything here that you'll get from one of the corporate online stores, but with excellent customer service and free shipping to anywhere in AZ. 

I'm a big fan of the order ahead feature. Just submit your order online and everything is ready for you when you walk through the door. An added perk is that you'll leave feeling good about supporting your local homebrew shop and keeping your money in the community.",5
4339,"Thank you, Higher Grounds, for this amazingly burnt French toast! There was also a hair in my seasoned potatoes! And since I am home recovering from an accident I had with my foot I cannot drive. That being said I ordered using Grubhub. So now my food is burned and I have nothing else to eat and no way to get more food unless I order from somewhere else and spend a bunch more money....",1
4340,"This restaurant spells CLASS!  Love this steakhouse and is by far the best I've been to!  The d√©cor is beautiful.  The ambiance was so cozy and I LOVE the darkness!  It was funny to watch everyone pull their flashlights out to read the menu but here's a tip...hold your menu under the little lamp on your table and you'll see your menu. :-)  Once you've ordered, sit back and enjoy!  Our waitress was amazing.  The staff was amazing.  Never a dirty dish left on the table and our glasses were constantly being refilled.  Service at it's finest.  The food...OMG!  It was so good!  I loved the bone marrow and the filet mignon melted in my mouth!  The spinach was good but a little on the rich side and the candied yams were delicious!  The chocolate pie was delicious but very very rich and dense.  I could only eat a few bites.  I kid you not, if I could hop on a plane tomorrow from San Diego to Las Vegas, I would!  I would fly there just to eat at this restaurant and head home!!  It was an amazing dinner and experience!",5
4341,"Little Caesars........please advise your staff, that if they are going to be rude and discriminatory to paying customers, they should not give those customer receipts with their frigging name on it. Yanary M, served us today, and her attitude was absolutely disgusting and customer service, piss poor. Your company will not be getting our money again.",1
4345,"This is my go to for ""cha chaan teng"" for the last several years. Affordable price, great food, and textbook milk tea. The lunch special menu changes everyday so I always look forward to the surprise for what's on the menu. My favourite lunch special would have to be the black pepper sauce chicken steak!",5

Tortillas made by hand 
The drinks are great

4351,"We went shopping the Sat after thanksgiving - an annual tradition for myself, mother, and best friend. The deals were great and we were able to get a huge pile of clothing. That was where the fun ended for us. The service was ATROCIOUS in so many ways. 

They made us feel unwelcome and acted as if we were bothering them while we shopped. The women working in the store began vacuuming at 5:40 (despite a 6pm closing time) and turned off the lights on us in the fitting room at 5:50. Between the 3 of us we spent $528.00 in clothing. They made a previous sale for $15 and there was only one other couple in the store so we knew things were slow. Despite the fact that we were first in line they served the other couple before me. They apologized only to the other couple as though it were out fault they didn't know how to work the register. We waited patiently but things only got worse. 

After finally ringing us up, one of the employees was refusing to punch the discount card after a $322 sale - stating she already punched it and implying that we were being deceitful. We were so offended - the other employee even told her it was not punched but she continued to rudely refuse. Finally - in a huff - she punched the card, slammed it on the counter and refused to speak to us. When leaving, we still wished her ""happy holidays,"" in spite of her behavior and she just walked away. The service spoiled our evening and marred our tradition.  What a shame.",1
4355,"Saw multiple reviews on this place saying this is the best burrito in town so I figured I was in the area and would give it a try.

You can actually order online and pick it up at the restaurant if you are ever in a hurry and didn't want to wait. I came on a Thursday evening around 6pm, there was no line and no wait, basically ordered my food and it was ready in around 10mins or less.

The menu is posted on the wall, very small menu for choice but good enough for what they offer. You can choose your burritos with, chicken, mango chicken, pulled pork, steak, vegetarian, halibut, or they also have ones with 2 meats in them, like chicken and steak, etc.

They offer 2 sizes, a small and large, choice between white or whole wheat tortilla. At first when I was the bag that holds the large, I thought it would be small. But as I saw them put the burrito together, they definitely don't cheap out on the ingredients. They give a handful of ingredients that go into the burrito as well as a big spoon on guacamole. Usually most places will charge you extra for guacamole but this place didn't!

If you want it hot, they put a good portion on jalapenos and hot sauce which makes it quite spicy!! 

The size which it came out to was fairly big, I shared half with a friend and I'm glad I did because it filled us both up well! The cost of it was around $10 which was a good deal!

Will definitely be coming back if we're in the area and wanting to save money on a filling meal!",5
4356,Probably by far one of my favorite karaoke places to go to in Vegas! Yong (the owner) was an awesome host! This place is located right across from UNLV and is a few minutes away from the strip. I highly recommend this place because 1) there is a lot of parking spots unlike other places and 2) great karaoke systems and songs selections!  Going to be coming here again and again when my group of friends and I feel like singing our hearts out!,5
4357,"We broke a hiking pole and expected to ppurchase a replacement set. Instead, Jeff. A remarkably knowledgable and effective customer service rep offerred to repair the pole.

REI ROCKS!! Thanks again. Jeff!!",5
4360,"When you can find something so cheap and good on the Strip, you hold onto it and never let it go.  So whenever we're looking for a sweet treat and we're doing the tourist thing in Vegas, you can find us here.  Every flavor we've ever had is rich and tasty.  The servers are fast and polite.  There is not a bad word I can say!",5
4362,"Favorite place and the service is always excellent. Entire staff was knowledgeable and polite. I never once have had a bad experience here. I would highly recommend Markus, Anthony, and Ted. Unfortunately I cannot recall other names there, but the entire staff from security to check out during any hours of operation.",5

4364,"My favorite poutine place in Montreal!

* Open 24 hours
* Large list of different toppings for poutine
* Fresh curds

My typical order is the two hot dogs (toasted all dressed) with a side of original poutine!",5
4365,"Excellent office. My favorite hygienist is Michelle. She's very thorough and friendly. I will definitely be returning for my 6 month recall to her. Everyone in the office is very nice and kind. The doctor is absolutely excellent. I went in for some fillings today and I swear to you the local anesthetic didn't even hurt I didn't even know he did it. I needed to get like 5 fillings done and he did it not only quickly, but efficiently, as it was painless. I would definitely recommend this office for anyone that is looking for an excellent dentist.",5
4367,"Spectacular. It look me much longer than it should have for me to visit Carnevino. We went recently for my guy's birthday dinner and we had an absolutely amazing dinner from start to finish. Service was on point and every dish we tried was exceptional. 

Not even a month later we had a friend in town so we knew we had to make a return visit to Carnevino since he always requests a nice steak dinner on every visit. A couple of other friends also decided to join us making the meal that much more enjoyable! We shared the bone in ribeye, porterhouse, grilled octopus and a few other sides. The meal was even more perfect than the one we enjoyed on our previous visit. 

I'm already plotting our return visit to finally sample the riserva. Carnevino is definitely top tier as far as steakhouses go, I highly recommend this place.",5
4373,"I HATE fried zucchini, but I will never go to Frank's and NOT order it. Fanfreakingtastic. Great food and the friendliest of service. You're likely to walk in and see the back tables put together for a group of friends. That doesn't happen in a place with bad food or service.",5

I have been to several of these restaurants through out the country and I am so glad that as they make their way west (soon to be in Victorville ca) the quality has not changed. The wait for a table in a busy Saturday morning was 45 minutes,  I need a cup of coffee while I waited so I ordered one at the to go counter. I was helped by a gentleman named Lance,  he was happy to oblige my caffeine craving and when I tried to pay, he said it was on the house.  Our server was a gentleman named Uly,  again very nice and helpful. If management reads this,  I hope Lance and Uly get the credit they deserve.

He made the most amazing sandwich I've ever had from subway (and that's alot) with great recommendations for my sandwich. I always get the rotisserie chicken and he requested some extras (oregano, onions and bell peppers... Which I'm not a fan of any of it.) But then toasted it like it was saut√©ed!

We ordered 6 Jalape√±o Honey wings, Garlic Bread with Cheese and Thin Crust sausage and pepperoni pizza. Was delicious! Coming back for the pizza skillet when I'm not so stuffed! Highly recommend this place!",5

4387,"I love my new ride and this place.  Mircea helped me, he was professional, honest and looked just like Robin Williams circa 1990.  Within 10 minutes on the car lot I found the car I wanted.  A  super. sexy sport (yes I'm one of those girls who thinks some cars are sexy) in ""magnetic"" gray.  I told Mircea what I was looking for on my trade-in, monthly payments and the car price.  

He said he would see what he could do and assured me before going to his manager ""I don't like going back and forth.  I just like to get you the best deal I can the first time.  I'm going to try to make you happy."" I of course assumed this was just an act and started mentally preparing myself for three hours of back and forth followed by a frightening ""you're a first time buyer"" APR convo.  I was wrong.  After ten minutes he came back with a 2.9 APR, a discount on the car and exactly what I was looking for on my trade-in.  Within 20 minutes I was working with the manager and signing contracts.  The entire staff was courteous and professional -- there was no sleaze to be found. 

I highly, highly recommend Mircea to anyone purchasing a car.  I also highly recommend Toyota for first time buyers.  They use their own financing; if you put down a good down payment and you have good credit you will get a great APR.  (The last dealership I had gone to was trying to sell me a car at a 9.9 APR because of my newbie status... yikes.)  I'm a fan of Power Toyota and happy endings.",5
4388,"A-MAZE-ING!
These arepas are so tasty- my sister and I went twice in three days (and we were only in town for four!) I'll be recommending this to any of my friends going to Vegas. If you're staying on the strip- it's worth the drive.
Yum!",5
4391,"My friends dragged me here one time. It was a sobering experience where I learned what it means to be objectified.

The bar is sorta dirty, but points to them for having access to a food truck from their patio.

Interesting note, it seems like everyone has a ""gay lisp"" at Charlie's.

Not my type of place. Maybe I'm the wrong demographic?.",1

4393,"6 Jan. 2011 8:00am. Accepted delivery of my new Inglis gas dryer from the Best Buy located at 3820 S Maryland Pkwy Las Vegas, NV 89119. Delivery guy #1 removed old dryer and allowed me to clean the area. Delivery guy #2 brought the new dryer in. I watch the Delivery guy #1 hook up the gas line and exhaust vent hose. After he was done he pushed the dryer against the wall and crushed the vent hose. I told him that and he said ""it is ok"". I told him no its not the hose should not be crushed like that. Reluctantly he moves the dryer forward and fixes the vent hose. I also ask him why did you fully extend the vent hose? The Vent Hose had two 90 degree turns. I tell him the more twist and turns you have in the vent hose the less efficient it will be and increases the chance of a lint fire. What he should do is fully extend the hose and cut off the excess so that it is short and straight as possible. He gives me the same reply ""it is ok"". I get tired of trying to explain common sense installation procedures and let them leave. Typical ""I don't care it;s not my problem"" mentality like most people have nowadays. After they leave I go behind the dryer and push all the excess vent hose length back into itself and straighten the hose so that it is as short and straight as possible, which is what the delivery guy should have done. I plan on installing a Rigid Metal Vent to replace the Flexible Metal Vent. Rigid Metal Vents are recommended for best drying performance and to reduce the risk of lint fires. I am very disappointed with this installation. Next time I will spend my money elsewhere.",1
4396,"Great shop with good customer service and impressive facilities. Every time I go there I can't help but drool over the cars in the shop. Even though they tune Lamborghinis and Porsches, they still want to help out the little guys with ""lesser cars"" too, which is nice! Can't wait to get my BBK from here soon :)",5
4397,"I think I am in love with Sprouts! No, seriously. It's a little crunchy (lots of mountain biking, spandex-wearing, tree-hugging-like people), but these guys do have one of the best selections of fresh, organic fruits and vegs around (maybe with the exception of Whole Foods) at a reasonable price. 

That's not what I like most about this place, though. I LOVE their free guide to gluten- and wheat-free eating that's placed throughout the store. The booklet contains a no-nonsense list of foods and brands that do not contain gluten that are sold within the store. 

The staff members are very knowledgable and can explain which supplements are best for people who are sensitive to gluten. It's not until you try to eliminate this substance from your diet that you truly gain an understanding of how much crap actually contains it. It's EVERYWHERE! 

Anyway, this store chain is so much cheaper than the majority of mainstream grocers, e.g., Fry's, Albertsons. Their bulk product sections are really phenomenal and offer customers a great deal of variety to choose from at an even better price. 

Love it, love it, love it!!!!",5
4398,I called this business 3 times and never once got a call back. Very unprofessional. I've decided to take my business elsewhere!,1
4399,I rarely write reviews but I had to review this place because I've been to a lot of salons and resorts since moving here and for the past year I've only been coming here. Each time it is even more pleasant of an experience. Not only are they super affordable but the people are extremely nice and make sure your nails are perfect before you leave. They were even willing to stay late to make sure my toes were dry :) highly recommend!!,5
4400,"Spent a few days in Vegas for New Years and was planning to take a helicopter ride to the Grand Canyon, paid extra for front seats in the copter and was going to have a champagne lunch along the Colorado River on the canyon floor. Let me tell you doing this is not cheap but it's a beautiful experience. Not something you do everyday. You only live once so live everyday like it's your last. 

Ok my wife and I get up after a amazing Las Vegas New Years Eve. Btw this rivals Times Square New Years Years and the temperature is warmer. We were excited about this trip. We go down the the area where the limos pick people up and wait. Here comes Maverick Helicopter Company picking people up for a Grand Canyon flight and then another helicopter company picking people up and our guys are late. We call and they tell our trip has been cancelled. What?????? This is due to weather. Ok I get that but why am I calling you guys to find this out? Why don't you have the courtesy to call and let people know what's going on? It's already bad enough the trip we planned for months is being cancelled. You can't help what Mother Nature does but, can you at least call the people that paid good money? Does that make sense or is it me? Is this how you treat people? I don't think so. People if this is something you may want to try, DO NOT USE these guys so you don't waste your time for a trip that may not happen and no one will tell you.",1
4401,"First heard about about St. Francis on local TV show ""Arizona PBS ei8ht""
http://www.desertsmokebbq.com/blog/tag/st-francis-restaurant/
and wanted to try it for a new date.  

Parking is tight, forget the local street possibilities or the strip mall across the street and resign yourself to their valet.  Ms. D was late in arriving but we still got into their Happy Hour -(thank you Yelp'ers, this was a great tip).  I was early and at my asking The Hostess had saved us the one available outdoor seat which I knew she would want, so they accomodate special requests with ease.  We were cheerfully greeted by server Lonnie who was on top of it and got us exactly what we wanted in two flights of food and twin drink orders for a fantastic value in record time before the happy hour clock struck end.  

I had been before and sought out their Grapefruit 'tinis but they weren't available, so Lonnie recommended the Ruby Reds which we selected and found to be quite good too.  The interior has a wonderful atmosphere, not too loud, pleasantly decorated and be sure to notice the architecture cable ceiled which add a modern tone to the place.  The goat cheese was wonderful, pork verde delicious and Ms. D said her onion burger was fantastic.  Total was just under $45, added 20% tip so it hit the value mark well in the bullseye.

We were never pushed, politely attended too and had the perfect scenario to focus on our conversation. Wonderful for a first date, casual business meeting or possibly even an anniversary.  I don't hand out Five Stars easily but when I want to impress picky foodie Ms. D and then it all goes well, I pull out the props.  Service, food quality, variety, selection, portions, drinks, and value were all spot on.  This is not the first time I've been to St. Francis and it has been consistent so I'm calling out the rare 5 star award based on dependability and repeated service.  
Thank you",5
4404,Went there for the first time the other day and I loved it! It was so much fun to wander each isle and look at all the different foods people eat and create. I left with more junk food than I would have liked to but thankfully I got lots of 'real' food too. There is an option for a membership card which is $10. I got the card so I'll try it out next time I go and see how the big/small the discount is.,5
4405,"I started coming to Kyklos a few years back and at that time I really didn't enjoy greek food. This place totally changed my perception on greek food, especially gyros. It's located in mall food court but that doesn't take away from how amazing the food is. The gyro supreme is what I always get, even though I tell myself every time that I will get something different. The quality in the food or service does't change, it's always been top notch. The prices have gone up, but that hasn't stopped me from going there at least once a month. The food is amazing and I will continue to come here and enjoy the food they offer. My only wish is that they'd expand their business to the northern side of Vegas.",5
4406,"We thought this would be a good place to stay but it turned out to be terrible! We came in for a wedding and this was the hotel chosen for all out of town guests since most people were flying in. The location seemed convenient and we were excited to see it had a little kitchenette in the room. However, once we arrived we were incredibly disappointed. I called the day before and was told check in was at 3pm but to call in the morning because sometimes they can get you in earlier. We arrived just after 3pm and headed to the front desk to check in. The young lady there pulled up our reservation and said our room wasn't ready yet. I expressed my concerns since it was already after 3pm and we wanted to get into the room before the reception. I asked if we could be put in another room and she said she was fully booked and (I quote) ""the housekeepers aren't done yet and we have a large property. I can't tell them to hurry up."" She assured me it would be no more than a 30 min wait. I went back to my car and waited. We were not able to get into our room until 5pm! That is ridiculous!!!! The next morning we went down to the front desk for the ""grab and go breakfast"". That was also another disappointment. When we entered the front desk lady was too busy gossiping with someone else to even acknowledge our existence as we searched for this so called breakfast. When she decided to take a break in her conversation she told us to look in the cupboard where we found one nature valley granola bar. Needless to say we left hungry. Later that afternoon we got some news and we needed to head home. We told the front desk that we would need to check out early and asked if there was anything they could do about the charge for the second night. We explained how we were unhappy with the experience overall and we weren't able to get into our room until 2 hours after check in. This lady at the front desk (each time we spoke to someone different) was very rude to us. She said it wasn't her problem and she couldn't do anything about it. She said check is from 3pm forward or whenever your room is ready. She didn't offer a discount or any compensation what so ever. So as guests we are held to a certain time standard as far checking out but the hotel can do whatever they want without any concern for their guests. I will never stay at one of these hotels ever again and I will strongly recommend to all my friends and family that they never stay here as well. For those ladies who worked at the front desk remember you are working in a CUSTOMER SERVICE industry meaning you need to deliver good customer service! So incredibly disappointed!",1

NOTHING and no one compares to Jera! She is the queen of sugaring. I'm so lucky that my friend referred me to her back in 2014 because she's irreplaceable. She is so precise - never misses a hair or an ingrown. She is so sweet, understanding, funny, cute and makes you feel so comfortable even for a Brazilian. I travel back to Las Vegas now just to see her. She is amazing and worth every single penny plus more.",5
4411,"There's so much good things I have to say about this employment agency!
For starters, they have such great staff! My recruiter was Cassandra Ulloa, and she helped me find a contractor position with Genentech (So. San Francisco). (She also works really fast to find you position that you're fit for). And after 6 months of working at Genentech, They offered me a FTE regular position with them! Cassandra was so helpful with the initial interview stage, and even helped prepare me by doing a mock interview (which helped alot - since Genentech actually asked the same questions surprisingly lol).
My point-of-contact during my Contractor employment period was Lindsey Deering & Dericka Pradt. They were both so extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and ALWAYS available whenever I had a question. I could always call them or email them, and they always got back to me same-day. Very good attention to clients. 
Regarding the process of working through Aerotek, it is very easy hiring process, and they offer medical benefits + dental & vision as well. They also have online statements for your tax stubs and W2, which is convenient. Also, they offer HSA, which I really liked.
They are so awesome! 
If I ever look for a new job again, I'll definitely be coming back to Aerotek for assistance. :)",5
4414,Today I got my furniture delivered . I ordered a bed frame and a dresser with a mirror . The guys that delivered it were super professional and set it up fast  . However the bedframe only came with the headboard not the side rails . I was upset but when I got a call from my sales lady Belinda who helped me and my roommate Friday . She fixed it right away and I got a call from her saying they would deliver it tomorrow with no charge ! I could not be more satisfied . She handled it well ! She's awesome and the best sales lady I have ever met . She will not let you down . She's honest and won't sell you anything she wouldn't purchase herself . After seeing all these reviews I was very nervous wether I was going to get my side rails or if I had to pay more or whatever the case would have been but like I said Belinda took care of it for me ! I can't wait to buy more furniture from her ! Thank you !,5
4415,"I love this parc - an under-appreciated gem in the Montreal area. Generally come in from Griffintown on the bike path and love stopping at the tip of the parc for a short and scenic break from my ride. When biking with my daughter, we also enjoy stopping at the numerous art installations in the parc for pictures.

The parc also has lovely BBQ facilities and these are generally used by the public. The atmosphere is always pleasant and family oriented - nothing rowdy by any means. Someday I hope to make use of these facilities. It's really lovely.

There is also an abundant amount of parking at the entrance of the parc.",5

- Clean environment
- Friendly staff.

I placed an order 2 days ago at 11 pm, the guy told me it would take them 30 to 45 minutes it was about to be 1am when i decidedto call Dominos (the store manager answered). Told me no order was pending so since they were closed he decided to give me credit so the next day same time i called to reorder same 30 to 45 minutes called no one anwered. So today I called again and store manager answered and told me that when my order went through there was a ""NO DELIVER TO THIS ADDRESS.""

This is a great place to check out if you are in the area. In the middle of the damn you can stand in two separate states simultaneously.

Very impressive.",5
4426,"On Sunday they are supposedly opened until 9:30 but when we called they said they closed at 9 because they were busy. So we politely asked if its okay if we made a reservation at 8:30, and they said sure. So when we got there they had to go ask the boss if we could be seated. After she said asked we got seated. After we got seated we got constantly reminded that they close at 9:30. The service was alright after we ordered and gotten our food, but then around 9:25 they handed us bill and asked us if we could pay first so that they can settle the computer which I'm fine with. I understand that they just want to close and go home. So we paid first and we continued eating until 9:25, which we were once reminded again that they closed in 5 minutes. So we finished up eating, left a tip, and then left. Right as we walked out the door one of the workers walked out and rudely said ""YOU CAN KEEP YOUR SEVEN CENTS."" First of all, we left a six dollar tip for them. Secondly, I'm upset and angry at how we were treated. We were rushed and rudely treated. If I had a choice I would rate this no stars for their rude service.",1

He provides very valuable and reliable information. I am a student and I have renters, life, auto, and car insurance with Rick, so as you can imagine there is a lot to learn and a lot of questions to be asked. He has been very good at getting back to me about any questions I've had along the way. Often, he proposes ideas to save me money and secure my future further (who doesn't want that!).

If there is ever an issue, Rick is very quick to address it and solve it with me. He is very attentive and thorough which are very essential qualities I look for in an agent.",5

Everything I've ordered here has been exceptional. The food is killer, and the prices are more than reasonable. Check out my previous review for specific recommendations. 

I love that Pinky's has kind of a grungy vibe, sometimes coupled with death metal churning away on the patio, and a bevy of tattooed and tough-looking waitstaff, yet I still receive excellent service and share the restaurant with every kind of person that calls Charlotte home. And it's a fantastic spot to bring out-of-towners!

Pinky's is more than legit. They've got a loyal fan in me.",5
4441,"By far the best healthclub in the north Scottsdale area, outstanding staff, top notch equipment, and very responsive management. Take a tour and you will be impressed, but it's the community that you become a part of that really is where the value is. We love the village! 



UPDATE: Sadly, the quality of this place has gone down markedly since we joined, untrained young employees and a high turnover rate combine to make it a frustrating experience at what should be a premium health club for the price... Expect to be irritated if you come in when the personal trainers are running a class,  you arent able to use large parts of the equipment in the gym, personal training classes take priority and you will be  unceremoniously told to leave that area...we were getting updates as to golf expansion plans they have, meanwhile the day to day experience at the actual club is falling apart and nobody seems to be in control of it. When my brother was visiting from California, I called the club the night before, and had two mountain bikes ready for us to get on a ride before it got hot in the afternoon ... We showed up early, bikes weren't ready, One was missing a pedal and when I pointed out that the tire was flat on the other, I got handed a bicycle pump. Outstanding. Once I finished pumping up the tire and we actually got going it was already an hour later then we had planned, all the time wasted switching bikes out and trying to find a non-broken one was the only cycling experience to be had that day. My mother-in-law was visiting from out of state, when we took her to the clubs spa for a scheduled Mani-Pedi, The staff had some kind of issue with their staffing going on and took it out on my wife and mother-in-law, who were obviously so upset they left and didn't go back. The cook they had working for them for a few months used foul language within earshot of us on the balcony while we were trying to eat our food.

Having gone through a terrible experience last time when the movers exhausted all their blankets half way through wrapping my bigger furniture I was especially cautious of that. Dose did not disappoint me in any way. Their entire crew was really good and they had plenty of packing supplies. Especially their crew leader Jim came across as a very careful person and attentive to details. He as well as rest of the crew namely Victor, Luis, Aaron and Chris all were very friendly and super careful in loading and unloading stuff. Jim's presence certainly made a difference. Overall I had a very positive experience with Dose Moving and would rehire in a heartbeat for my future moves. Thanks a lot guys!",5
4455,"Went to Steak for my Anniversary and it was one of the best dining experiences that my wife and I had. We were seated on the second level over looking the restaurant, which was so chic and was like being in London.Our waiter was on point with everything that night which made our dinner that much better. Our meal started off with the bread ""mmm the bread plate"" which had three types of breads. 

Then the coolest thing of all they brought out a cart of different types and cuts of meats and explained each one of them to us. We ended up getting the ribeye and the beef Wellington which they split in two for us so that we can share. We got 2 sides to accompany or ribeye and they were the Asparagus and Mac & cheese and trust me when I say that you will not be disappointed if you order these sides. And if you are looking for a sauce to go with your steak I would try the peppercorn sauce which was to die for. 

I have to say that everything that we ate was so amazing and so delicious it brought our taste buds alive. I will be returning for sure.",5

I had a dinner reservation in Mandalay about 10 minutes after the manicure was supposed to end and she did it just right on time! I got gel and it was only 5 days ago, but my nails still look great. Very impressed. Their services are NOT cheap, but it's a high end, upscale spa on the strip in Delano. The quality of service was worth the premium price.",5
4459,"There are only 2 things I can recommend about this buffet - the view of the flamingos and koi pond which is just gorgeous and our server who was attentive and friendly. And that's the one star. 

Sorry folks, usually I try to find positives, but this one pissed me off.
The food was just so sub-par, I'm still astonished anyone goes there. Of course there were a few items that were ok... they were making fresh soft tacos to order (but this was the Mother's Day dinner and at $25.95. which I believe is more than their usual...THIS is it for freshly prepared entrees?!) No crab, no fresh shrimp...sigh...ok the chocolate fountain was good, but the neon green cheesecake weirded me out.  

I have to mention decor, because it was just so tired and dated. The presentation of the food was straight out of the 70's. Truly, just keep looking at the lovely garden and animals and don't think about the money you've wasted on your meal.",1

4463,"I love Dicks.

Uhhhh

By this point, I've probably had everything on the menu twice over. There are so many dishes that are both varied to please everyone, and still consistent with what they are going for which is the New Mexican Cuisine. 

Dick's has it all, a quaint and unique atmosphere. It feels like a small eatery you'd find in a downtown of a big city, it's a really fun, dark, kind of sexy place to take a date too. There aren't many better first date locales.

The Pork Chop Chorizo, Roasted Garlic Plate, Red White and Blue Enchiladas, and of course the Carne Adovada are some of the real standouts for me. They serve Chimay on draft, the servers are friendly, and it's got the fun great atmosphere to boot. You owe it to yourself to try it.

Money would have been better spent on DiGiorno and Chef Boyardee, and the preparation time would have been quicker.  Although it was packed with meat, it was probably one of the greasiest pizzas I've ever had.  The middle of the pizza should be reserved for those with cast-iron stomachs and a handful of Tums.  The ravioli were stuck together and the sauce was borderline pure tomato paste; very thick.  Ravioli were poor in taste and texture.  I think they were covered in the same sauce as used use on the pizza, but with meat added.  Speaking of the meat, that was the only thumbs-up I can say about the place, the meatball used on the pizza was pretty good.  Not cheesy and bready, and I believe it was the same meat added to the ravioli sauce.  I'd love to get my money back for this meal, but I will never step foot in the establishment again.  I can't imagine they get a lot of return customers.  I give it 90 days and that store should be closed.  Since it's Las Vegas, I'll make a bet on it.",1
4466,"This store has no idea when Arizonians shop. Their hours are the worst and even closed on Saturday and Sunday. If you're going to overcharge for your products, at least make it a little more convenient for your dwindling customer base. Amazing how you've been able to stay in business this long",1
4467,Food sucked. Strawberry's were kinda fresh. prices way too high. no more chicken up grade available. prices too high,1
4468,"Since I was accustomed to HIIT training, I was really hesitant to try pure barre at first. 9 months later, leaner than ever, and addicted to the burn, I can't get enough of Pure Barre Chandler. The instructors are always welcoming and energetic. The music puts me in the zone hitting the right BPM for all the different segments. And last, but not least the variation of exercises works muscles I've never felt before.

I highly recommend taking at least 10 classes to get acclimated with the moves and to really start feeling the difference.

4475,I love stopping by this Starbucks. The staff here is great and it seems to be a lower traffic location- which makes for a quick drink or quiet break.,5
4476,I really like the food here. But I also like the staff they're really attentive and everybody has a great attitude. I've only been here once so far but I know I will certainly be back.,5

Always very clean and treat you nice. Had some great pedicures for a reasonable prices, even my husband like to go",5
4484,"Best rib eye I have ever had - and that's an understatement. The black pepper crust on these steaks is unreal. Makes the meat infinitely better. The meat is tender, juicy, and every bite is better than the last. They cook the steaks to the exact temperature you ask for. And the service is UNPARALLELED! Do yourself a favor and ask for Ricky. RICKY IS THE MAN! He provided us with one of the best table experiences we have ever had. Such a gentleman, addressing us with ""yes sir, yes ma'am"". Everything he suggested tasted amazing. We would come back here for Ricky and for the black pepper crusted rib eye. Ps...when he suggests the famous 24 layer chocolate cake, don't say no even though you think you cannot possibly eat another bite. Like Ricky says, you won't regret it",5
4485,"Worse service ever!  I have. We have been here a couple times and everything has been great,  but the service we received today was deplorable.  The waitress needs to be retrained on how to speak to customers.  She was rude!",1

4487,"I'm a sucker for ""homemade"" ice cream so I'm not really sure why it took me so long to try this place out but better late than never! It has such a classic ice cream parlor feel to it. The flavors are quite unique such as lavender red raspberry or chili chocolate. I got the chili chocolate and I am in love!! It sounds intimidating just by the name but the spice elevates the chocolate like you wouldn't even believe. Upon first bite, you can't taste the spice but it kicks in a little after.

I really like that a family-friendly place like Betsy's has such unique ice cream flavors. I will be back again and again!",5
4488,"Highly recommend this place. I bought my first gun here (just moved here from California) and these guys answered all my questions no matter how ""rookie"" they were.

4489,"Came in for dinner so it was pretty empty. Took a second for the hostess to greet us but once she did she promptly sat us at a table near another family. We waited and reviewed our menus.... and waited.... and waited.... and waited. The table next to us had a waiter come over multiple times. We had no one even bring us water. Several other workers were standing around, wandering around, and whenever I tried to make eye contact with one, they promptly shuffled away. 

Forget it. After 20 minutes we got up and left. Hostess didn't even inquire why we were leaving. Never again will I set foot here. I don't mind a bit of a wait, or slow service if it's understaffed or busy, but come on.",1
4490,Me and my boyfriend decided to go in and take a look around the store just out of curiosity. We were barely greeted when we walked in. We walked about for 30 minutes or so and they never once even acknowledged we were there. I wanted to ask about Psychic readings but the 2 workers were so into their own conversations that they didn't even notice me standing in front of their counter. So we left without buying anything and with no information. Will not go back to this location. :/,1

They did an excellent job of removing the posts, and even removed metal that was imbedded in trees that had grown up into the fence. They hauled the debris away and left the area clean. It cost me less than half of what the other leading Pittsburgh fence company quoted me for the project. I also appreciated that the company sent me a detailed contract with a drawing beforehand, even though the project was small. Paul always returned my phone calls the same day, and Bill even answered his phone in the evening.",5

PLEASE READ EVERYTHING before you sign because there is a section where they said ""if you complaint we will charge you tripple"" if you sign that paper, you will loose all of your money and get nothing back. I have to deal with them about a lost phone for 2 months and they WILL NOT call or accept calls and will never answer your email once they take deductable.

4504,"WE WENT FOR DRINKS BUT GOT HARASSED BY THE STAFF.
I Went for a drink with a couple of friends after we had dinner somewhere else.
We have stated at the door that we are only here for drinks not for dinner, we were welcomed and seated then the drama started when the first girl introduced her self as our waitress and took the orders she asked if we want to eat something and we said that we are only here for drinks, my friends asked for beer so it was easy but I made the mistake to ask for whiskey, the waitress didn't know what whiskey they have and after a few minutes she came back with a small piece of paper with the names of 3 brands only, I chose Chivas. Drinks came on their own no nuts no chips we said fine can we order nuts and chips and we will pay for them but the waitress replied we don't have but you can order food even though we mentioned in the beginning that we are only here for drinks. A couple of minutes after another waitress introduced herself and said that she will be our new waitress and asked if we want to eat something we replied no we are only here for drinks, her smile got smaller and she left but surprisingly she appeared again shortly after asking if we are sure that we don't want to eat something pushing everyone to our edges because it became very annoying. The biggest surprise was when she was replaced by a third silly young waitress came asking if we want to order some food. WTF . We are being harassed in a very annoying way and we are paying for it with what we believe is tactic of the management to make people spend more money. we left very upset because we went there to relax but we ended up pissed off. This place must remove the bar sign and keep the restaurant sign if they can't accommodate bar customers and must respect all customers no matter if they are there to have a couple of drinks or a full meal.
While we were leaving a young gentleman named Andrew asked how were things so we expressed our opinion and he gave us a card that was sitting at the front desk stating $20 off if you spend $40.
Sometimes you can repair the damage but sometimes you can and Sorry this time it won't work because they really spoiled our Saturday evening.",1
4506,"I have only been going to LA Fitness for about 6 months. I live in Scottsdale and work in Phoenix, so I go to the 20th St & Camelback, Scottsdale and Oak and McCormick Ranch locations.  The Scottsdale locations are GREAT! They are clean, the staff is really nice and I see people cleaning the equipment when they are done.  What is it with the Camelback crowd?  The place really smells bad! It really needs a good cleaning. There has been this big spot on the carpet in front of the womens locker room since I started.  I was on the treadmill the other day really noticing how stinky it was and then the guy next to me finished up and just walked off, I swear he was sweating like a pig, left the equipment drenched! UGH!!!  Good God! I couldn't believe it, Can't the employees make these people clean after themselves?? The reviews are right about the staff just hanging around at the front desk.....they should be cleaning something, anything.  It really is a shame that this centrally located facility is a real stinky mess!!  I can't wait for the new one to open on 7th Avenue! Maybe then they may clean up their act.",1
4507,"I have been to this restaurant several times in the past year.  The sushi was always fresh and delicious.  The all you can eat offer was a great deal and a main reason that I continued to patronize this restaurant.
When I went last weekend I was informed that there is no longer the all you can eat option. They now have a $30 dollar fixed  menu option.  The reason for the bad  review is that the quality of the food was so poor this time, that some of the food was not even eaten by the group I was with.  Everyone in the group commented that the food quality was poor and none  of us would ever return.  Sushi Sai WAS a nice restaurant, but it is time to find a new sushi restaurant.",1

Waited 5 minutes before I was acknowledged and my order was taken. Then when I went to the cashier she thought it was more important to fill up the sauce packets than cash me out.  The kicker was when I got home I noticed she overcharged me for my egg roll. Absolutely terrible, never going back. They deserve to go out of business.",1

We asked if any upgrades were available, as it was a special evening, and were given a junior suite on the 25th floor. Amazing views and beautiful, spacious room. 

The room was great. Huge, modern sofa overlooking the strip. Comfy bed with modern decor. The best part? The dual head shower with SPECTACULAR view of the stratosphere and surrounding area. It was huge!

I enjoyed the fresh and sometimes funky decor and subtle nods to the old Sahara.

I'll have this on top of choices for our next stay!",5

4527,"Stopped by the X-Iron Mills location tonite with a friend for dinner before catching a movie. Greeted and promptly seated with a promise that our waitress would be with us shortly. 15 mins of waiting and watching the 2 waitresses serve the 2 tables beside us before the manager dropped by to see if we have been served yet, we said no and he told us he would get someone right away. 8 minutes later, still no service for our table but the couple that just arrived got their drink orders taken. Had enough of the lack of service and went next door to Boston Pizza where we were seated and served in 5 mins.

A real pity for Milestones as I will NEVER go back to their again. Your servers lost out big time as I usually tip 20-50% (on outstanding service).",1

By far the best chicken in Arizona. It is always tender crisp and not to greasy.  The owner Allen is a real nice guy and often makes small talk to returning customers.  I love the 60's rock posters on the wall giving it that old diner feel.  As you wait for your food which is usually delivered by the owner himself, there are checkers and backgammon to pass the time.

To make matters worse she snipped down the sides of my big toenails so they are now very low and I am concerned about them becoming ingrown.

4545,"Stopped for breakfast. Not too hard to find - the vines growing around the door make it stand out in the strip mall. It is a darkish three room place with great music from the bar area and muted TVs showing sports throughout. Seating is community table style. It had a great vibe and menu. 

The dishes featuring chilis are truthfully advertised as ""smothered"" in chili sauce. I dug out my huevos rancheros, but when I return, will ask for the chili sauce on the side so I can control the volume. 

Coffee from ROC2 was out of this world. While the restaurant has their own blend, I recommend going out to Cave Creek to tour the roastery and pick up coffee. Unfortunately it is not open on Sundays and the Whole Foods we visited was sold out so I will have to order from the website.",5

I came here with my baby while his Dad was at the Las Vegas Convention. I was immediately greeted and seated. They got me a high chair and put it out of the main traffic. Jim was my server and was very attentive to all his guests. I asked for his opinion between the ham and eggs and steak and eggs, he suggested the ham and eggs, but I ended up getting the steak and eggs. Loved the steak and eggs! Steak was perfectly seasoned! I normally have to get A1 at restaurants, but this time no sauce needed. It was juicy and flavorful. A little charred. It also came with eggs, potatoes, and wheat toast. Eggs and potatoes were average. I like my potatoes a little crispier. But the toast was really good. Great overall!",5

They did not have any pizza slices ready for customers, this is difficult to understand as this is supposed to be a pizzeria. They told me that they were making me fresh pizza, but all they did was reheat old leftovers. If the owners don't know what they're doing they should reconsider being in business.",1

We had a lot of dairy restrictions in our party- everything from vegetarian, nut allergy, diary diary- and our AMAZING waitress Jordyn completely accommodated all requests without sacrificing the foods' taste. Ask for her, she's the best with recommendations and accommodations. 

I highly recommend eating here!!",5

Last week I went in for some garage cabinets and of course I walked down the wrong aisle. An employee asked if he could help me so I told him what I wanted. He took my cart, loaded up the cabinets and asked if there was anything else I needed help with. I needed extra shelves so he pushed my cart over to them and loaded me up. He also pushed my cart to the front end to get rung up (garage cabinets where heavy). As I was waiting for a hand to load them into my truck he walks out the door, walks right over to me and loads everything thing up. Turns out he's the store manager, Brian. Great service!!

The lady attending to me did an OK job on my feet, but she ruined my finger nails. I kept telling her that the tips are rough and not neat at all, but  she didn't listen to me nor did she reply back. She just kept uttering something in a language unknown to me.
Plus in order to get that right she just kept adding more coats on my finger nails. The nail paint started coming off within an hour. I was so disappointed with the service, I usually go back to the salons if something goes wrong but I knew there was no fun here.",1

The service was quick and attentive- we had a really sweet waitress who didn't rush us when it took us awhile to decide what to order.  The food came out quickly- but not too quickly. I had the roasted duck in red curry sauce and it was divine. The spice and flavor in the sauce was too good, and the duck was just falling apart.  The dish was served with a variety of properly cooked vegetables- nice color and just the right amount of bite.  Nice by the glass wine selection, too.

The food, service, atmosphere, location... it was all spot on. Just the kind of restaurant that Charlotte needs. Go Deejai!",5
4556,"What you get for $75:

(1) An uninformed 90 minute lecture about the history of ""taste"" and alcoholic beverages.  This meandering speech had my entire group tuned out after about 15 minutes.  The next hour and 15 was excruciating.  

(2) A ""personalized tasting"" that ended up being the same for most people despite our difference preference, which he spent 30 minutes writing down on a piece of paper, and then another 30 minutes ignoring.  

(3) 5 sub-1 ounce drinks that were worth maybe $10 if that.  We are taking $20-$35 bottles of scotch.  The best scotch poured was Black Bottle, a $35 blended scotch available at BevMo.  2 of the 5 scotches were so bad that they were undrinkable.  They were supposedly in the tasting because they were ""distinct,"" and we were not meant to like them. 

Take your money and go to a lounge (Andres at the Venetian, for example), and buy 3-4 high end pours of your favorite stuff.  This place was the biggest waste of time and money over our last Vegas trip, and that's coming from someone who lost $100 playing craps.",1

My friend rented a locker $25 & it was so worth it! Had all of our stuff in one area plus a charging station right in the locker! So you can charge your phone while you play! There's a main pool & a smaller pool right next to the bar. Pineapple Express was tasty! It comes with multiple straws so you can share with your squad. There are also cabanas & lofts you can sit on. Around the pool was crowded but in the pool, it was easy to maneuver around. Be careful when entering the pool though! I stepped down & didn't realize how deep it was & almost fell over!

I called Zen yesterday (after reading the excellent reviews here) to see if I could get an appointment for a haircut anytime soon, and not only did they get me in today, but they put me in Mindy's chair...she is really an artist with hair.  I wear mine short, it is really thick and I have a bazillion cowlicks yet she  went right through it like she's been cutting my hair for years.

I waited forever (9 minutes I was alone and very aware of the time) for a server in an almost empty restaurant! They took my order and NEVER came back. I actually had to get up and ASK for an additional glass of water. I ordered a filet with Gorgonzola cheese and it was THE saltiest steak I have ever had. The fingerling potatoes were equally salty. It was awful. For the price I could have pretty much went anywhere and had a better meal or two. I should have known better since it is a chain. The food and the service make this a ""restaurant"" you can miss out on for sure.",1

The Burrito was COLD, the taste was mediocre, the cheese was cold and not melted, and all that for over 15 bucks not including the beverage. Wow, ...I commented that it was cold, colder than my draft beer and the waiter said I'm sorry and walked off.

Never again. 

I only gave them a 1 star because the app wouldn't let me submit it with no stars.

4566,"My parents finally came through, albeit belatedly, with my birthday dinner (there was too much going on during the past few weekends for the family to get together) tonight. I had been wanting to try Pan Asia for some time as its been around for quite a while, but Sis was still under the weather...so we got take-out. 

Yes, Japanese take-out. I even had sushi. I didn't even know that was possible, let alone gastronomically correct, but hey, they offer Chinese also, so it can't be that much of a sin. 

We had ourselves a feast of feasts, so a list is in order: Shrimp Egg Rolls, Fried Pork Dumplings, Beef Skewers, Beef Fried Rice, Chilean Sea Bass (for Dad), Singapore Mee Fun (for Mum), Sesame Chicken (for Sis), Gyoza, Volcano Roll (I think there were 6 total), and Seafood Yaki Udon. By the way, the last 3 were my picks, but we all sampled and shared, like family should. 

""What you doing?"" My family were perplexed at my picture-taking. 

""Yelp, guys. Yelp!"" My mother's eyes rolled, my father groaned, my sister laughed. 

Mom asks, ""That isn't why you wanted take-out from Pan Asia for your birthday, is it?"" 

""Ummm...""

""He reviews EVERYTHING on that goofy site,"" Dad adds, shaking his head. 

Not all of what we ordered was dynamite, but nothing was inedible. The gyoza (seafood dumplings according to the menu) were tasty enough but were also lacking in culinary character or distinctiveness (just what was the 'seafood' anyway?), and the Beef Skewers were somewhat dry, but that's where my very minor criticism ends. Everything else, from usual Chinese fare like the Sesame Chicken, the Beef Fried Rice, and the Pork Dumplings to less-traveled (for me at least) Japanese offerings like the Seafood Yaki Udon won the evening. The Yaki Udon noodles were as bulky as bullrope yet soft as butter and were utterly crowded by shrimp, scallops, crabmeat, and a colorful array of fresh vegetables. The sushi rolls were tremendous and along with all else we brought home, held up well. Sushi has been getting a backlash like cupcakes currently are; they're trendy, flashy, but damn it, sushi's pretty damn toothsome, not to mention filling. The Volcano Rolls had salmon, avocado, a burningly arcane ""hot"" sauce, and capelin roe (masago) all wrapped up in a rich, heavy wad of supple white rice. 

I don't know if any of this is authentic. I don't care if any of it's authentic. It was just stomach-stuffing excellence. 

And while were on this tack, take my father's Chilean Sea Bass. An alchemistic,  nectarous sauce as sytgian as demon's blood coats a swollen filet of that which rivals lobster, the fearsome looking Patagonian toothfish, and with your first luscious, fall-apart bite, you have found Zion. I was envious of my father, but alas, there was too much for him to eat alone and too much else for him to try, so barter we all did, just so we could try what appears to be Pan Asia's optimum dish. Every one of Pan Asia's detractors need to try this dish. 

As far was the remainder goes, the pork dumplings were yet another great example of that staple of appetizers, the Sesame Chicken was triumphantly tender and candied, the beef fried rice was quite tasty with its generous chunks of meat and ideal rice, and Dear Mother's Singapore Mee Fun was a titillatingly tangled mess of Oriental goodness. So, out of 10 dishes, there were 8 winners, and 2 also-rans that were not at all dreadful. How could I not give them a 5?

Going back to the take-out aspect, each menu item we ordered was packed expertly, all of it fitting tidily in a box and arriving at the correct temperature. I often take this part of dining experiences for granted but will no more. 

If Pan Asia's take-out was of this high quality, eating in must be extraordinary. That can only mean one thing: Chef Wen Chun Yu is a true champion of the kitchen and deserves your dollars. This area is no wasteland. Ignore anyone who tells you differently. If and when I visit the restaurant, I shall shake Mr. Yu's hand and thank him personally for the grand smorgasbord he made for my family and I.",5
4569,"Went there for the first time last night.  I had a groupon and took my family out for my mother's birthday.  Let's start out with the positive - our server was extremely friendly and helpful.  We were the only ones in so we received all of her attention.  The cook in the back was also friendly.  Now for the bad - the food was beyond terrible.  We started off ordering 2 orka's.  They were very small amounts when the came out and not the portion size of other restaurants (I saw a similar review saying the same thing before - I agree).  When we talked about ordering the 2-meat combo, the cook said there were two ribs per meat (so we would get 4 ribs total).  Food came out with only two ribs and the waitress apologized that it was a misunderstanding and only 1 ribs per ""meat"" (again with the small size of the food).  I ordered the 3-meat combo (BBQ chicken, rib, and fried chicken).  I received one rib, a chicken leg, and a very small fried breast (that looked more like chicken fingers).  Now the really bad part, the rib was cold!! Not a little cold but right out of the refrigerator cold.  I tried the mashed potatoes and they were the same - frig cold!!  My son ordered wings and they were also cold.  We sent it back and I could hear the microwave ding when my food was heated up.  WOW!!!  The waitress (and cook later) apologies for serving cold food.  He was in a hurry to get all of our food out so he missed a couple plates.  Again - WOW!!  If I wanted leftover food that had been cooked hours (maybe previous day?) before and reheated in a microwave,  I could have bought a frozen sandwich at the 7-11 on corner and used their microwave.  This was the worst meal my family and I have had that we could all remember.  Just terrible is all I can really come up with as a thought.  The bill was $60 for two 3-meat dinners, 2 okra, wings, and 5 drinks.  Way over priced even if the food was good - which is was not.  Let me end on a positive note about the server - she was apologizing throughout the meal and did give all of us free deserts to go.  She invited us back to try it again.  I will have to pass and would recommend that you pass on this restaurant as well.",1
4570,"This was my first visit which was based on all the positive reviews and it did not disappoint. Fair pricing, friendly staff and quick turnaround time. Will return in the future for any Apple needs!",5
4571,"Enjoyed a great birthday dinner with a large dinner party. Great food, service and atmosphere. Don Pedro's never disappoints. Thanks!",5
4574,"Negative stars. 
Revolting, cheap, ugh.
I felt like the food was sitting out all day, after seeing the dessert table I was excited for that, but I was so wrong. They tasted SO stale. 
Do not go here. You'll regret it!",1
4576,"Amazing ! I love this place, I'm always satisfied when going here. Very friendly staff and clean environment. I highly recommend this place to anyone. They have a happy side and healthy side on the menu and makes ordering easy.",5
4578,"Awesome/Authentic Hawaiian shaved ice....My husband and I had just returned from Hawaii and were craving authentic shaved ice....we googled and found this location...Kevin (the owner) was a nice and friendly as they come...The sizes were generous and the shaved ice....was the best I've ever had...taking another trip back today, and bringing others. Best I have ever had.",5
4580,"Love, love, love this place! 

I have this really odd sea vegetable allergy...which makes no sense to me, so of course I would be one to love sushi, but can't have the seaweed... When I let the server know about my reaction to seaweed, she was very accommodating and they wrapped my sushi in soy paper! Music to my ears, and the sushi is wonderful. This is now our go to spot when we crave sushi. Great everything!",5
4582,Went in for an ingrown toenail and I was so nervous but her assistant and dr dove made me feel really comfortable and the procedure was done super quickly. She made conversation with me so I wouldn't feel nervous and I definitely recommend her :),5
4584,"I'm giving this place 5 starts simply because it's just straight up good. The place isn't meant to be a large fast food or fancy date night type of spot. It has 3 tables and has a cozy vibe to it. Enough options to please everyone. My ultimate favorite is the vegetarian Thali which also comes in non-dairy, since I'm intolerant to lactose. :)) The gentleman who served me was very polite and took the time to ask me how the meal was. Super affordable and two blocks from home. Most importantly, place is clean. No need to spend too much for a quick hearty meal. Two thumbs up!",5
4585,"As good as it gets for Fry Bread and I am an Arizona native!  First time here, very clean, very nice customer service, and the fastest fry bread I've ever gotten.  Had the open face fry bread and posole, both very good.  Will defintely be back!",5
4587,"We recently had our son's birthday party at this place.  In all honesty, I was a bit skeptical, thinking it'd be quite boring with not that much to do.

I will say I was very wrong; this place was great!  The staff had adjusted all the equipment to gear more towards the party goers age, and they were great with the kids.  I figured this would be a 90 minute crazy kid fest with children bouncing off the walls like racket balls, but it wasn't.  The kids got to play for about 30 minutes; like racket balls, then the staff had a whole bunch of organized games which lasted about an 45 minutes or so.  The kids really enjoyed the games and it really kept them all very involved.

At the end we did pizza and cake --which we had to provide; they provided paper products and juice, and the kids had about 20 minutes or so to eat.  We were the last party of the day and to my surprise, we weren't being pushed out the door.  The staff were very patient with us getting everything out and didn't seem to mind that we were there 20 minutes after the party was supposed to finish.

I was really pleased with this overall, and would certainly recommend it for a party location.",5
4588,"This place is awesome! The empanadas are amazing, pretty much everything they have is really good. They also have a green chili burrito that is the best I've ever had. Amazing fresh tortillas as well! We drive down here from Anthem almost weekly it's that good :)",5
4590,"The ice cream isn't that great and the workers look like they're half dead. No smile, no thank you, nothing. The tangerine sorbet also tastes like chemical ice.",1
4593,"This is the best Sushi restaurant I've found in Newmarket. It's my go-to place for Sushi take-out.

The place looks a bit small and unassuming, but it's nicely decorated, well lit and very well kept. It's not one of those places that focus on decorating and theme, but a place that focuses on the food, and one can definitely see that. Service is also very good and staff is always very friendly whenever I go there.

This restaurant focuses on the more basic and traditional sushi varieties. They have a large variety of sushi and do have some more exotic rolls, but it's the more traditional stuff that they do best. The sushi here is well made and very tasty. The rolls do not fall apart between your chopsticks like most other places in town. They also make good tempura and teriyaki, and a very good tasting miso soup.

Being a fan of sushi and having looked around quite a bit for a good sushi place, I can say this is the best I've found in the Town of Newmarket. I recommend this wholeheartedly for people looking for good quality and great tasting sushi.",5
4594,"All the great reviews really are true about this place. The fish is amazing, the calamari is a must, the shrimp is good (but peeling it is kind of annoying) and the salad is great. The waitresses are helpful and smile a lot. The gentleman at the fish station are on a mission to know what you want however, if you are friendly with them and crack a joke they tend to enjoy that. The food really tasty and cooked well. I was so full after my meal and I really enjoyed the experience. I can't wait to go back and try new fish.",5
4595,"I had the frozen microwave flatbed bread chicken sandwich my buddy Darnell had the south west steak burrito 

The frozen microwave chicken was not very good

Nor was the frozen microwave steak and egg burrito",1

Service was amazing! Our server always checked on us and was very efficient refilling our drinks.

We'll be back for more tasty and scrumptious food!",5

Water damage in the bathrooms the floors where rotted out in the bathroom s, sulfur coming out of the pipes no drinkable water, no AC unit the shed that was in the pictures was removed without asking me. They basically stole 5000 grand with a smile and told me to deal with it. I am now dealing with the Nevada mobile home division, the Nevada housing authority, the department of health and welfare services. At this point I told them to keep my 5000 and the trailer all I want is out of the lot rent which is 500 dollars a month. RUN RUN RUN.",1
4604,"We have to use towing companies to transport our machines on occasion for trade shows. We were able to get one locally to bring over for the show as opposed to having to transport it from our plant in CA.
Since I have had many experiences with towing companies it is easy for me to give a comparison to others. This was one of the best experiences that I have had as well as one of the least expensive.
The drivers were prompt and courteous as well as genuinely concerned about the piece of equipment that they were hauling.
I wish that I could recall the first drivers name, but I can not. He was a former rocker that was now into gospel music.
 The second driver was Tony who moved from Maui to Las Vegas. 
I am going to guess that some of the negative reviews here are due to the people being upset about having their car towed when they were not expecting it to be.
Since this was a planned tow I can tell you that this company ranks up there in service with any other company that I have used.
Should we be in need of a tow while in the Vegas area I would not consider any other company that Ewing Brothers.",5
4605,"I have recently started this company cleaning my 4 homes.  What I like most about this cleaning service is that they send you a quick survey of how they did with smiley faces or frowns.  If your not happy, they will send someone out immediately to clean and fix what was wrong.  Also, they can switch out your cleaning people for another team if needed.  I LOVE Maria & Humberto because they do such a great job and you can smell the freshness when you come home and walk through the door!  They are super friendly and always ask if there is anything specific that I need done.  You can also leave a note or list.  I can't say enough about this team and hope that they never get too busy to clean my homes.  :)",5
4607,"My husband and I eat here frequently as it is local to us. We typically sit at the bar where we can socialize. The staff is always nice, the whiskey is fine (flights are fun/interesting), and the burgers are amazing. I'm a vegetarian and this is my favorite place to go for a burger.",5
4608,Josh is great!  Very helpful and easy going. We had a blast as a family on the jet ski's and plan on returning again soon!  Thanks for being available and reasonably priced!,5

4610,"Went here with my family, we ordered the classic bruschetta to share, which was by far the best bruschetta we had all ever eaten! The tomatoes were very flavourful and the cheese was super fresh. For my main I got the butternut squash ravioli, there were maybe 4 or 5 ravioli which I honestly didn't think would fill me up but I was stuffed! It was not only filling, but delicious. I wish I had the stomach to order 3 more plates ;)",5
4611,"Experience:  came here with a group of folks to try out Taco Tuesday's. I've been here many times before, and this is my favorite bar, so I guess it deserves a review finally. 

Facility: this is a very eclectic, quirky, fun bar.  The artwork is weird, but makes for a great conversation piece every time I come. There is outside seating in front of the bar, in case you want to people watch everyone on Fremont. There is bar seating directly inside and even a few booths.  Out back there is an amazing private garden, and this is my favorite spot.  It has greenery, cool art, and a fireplace. There is even a small smoking area behind it with a working heavy duty see saw for grown ups. 
We sat out here, because it was a pretty nice evening, but for those that had a chill, they even had those portable heaters that look like a light pole to move to your table. 

Service:  most of the time I have great service here.  With our big group last night, there was one waiter that was a little pushy about clearing the plates. I appreciate someone asking ""Is there anything I can take?"", but he kept specifically asking for each plate on the table, ""can I take this?"", then on to the next one, ""Can I take this?"" 
When people are talking and drinking, they tend to pick, so just leave the food. He even went so far as to say in response to someone saying, ""Is there still some in there"", as he was removing it...""It's cold, are you going to eat it like that?"" 
Well, not after you called it out at the whole table like that!
Anyway, besides that guy, the staff is courteous, helpful and attentive. 

Food and drinks:  they have this yummy grapefruit beer I get every time I go. I started out drinking the $1 beers on special last night, but be warned, they are only 7oz mini bottle beers. They are so cute though. They said they ran out of Dos XX, so they served Sol instead. Then they ran out of Sol and they magically had Dos XX again. LOL! 
Anyway, I ended up switching back to my grapefruit after a while. 
We ordered the $2 tacos, which were small, but pretty tasty, especially after I ordered some jalape√±os to top them off with. 
Then we ordered a mix of appetizers from the happy hour, such as garbage fries, fried pickles and Mac and cheese balls. All of them were good bar food. The garbage fries are really good with a bunch of topping such as cheese, fresh jalape√±os, avocado, bacon, and a sunny side up egg on top. Yum!

Overall:  I love this bar. Between the cool atmosphere, good bar food, and grapefruit beer, I will continue to come back.",5
4612,I regret not using my old photo for my drivers license but I misunderstood and thought I would have to wait for it in the mail So I take a new pic.

I would like to try other things on the menu but I feel like if I don't order the chicken strips I will regret it. The habenero honey is my favorite. Also, this place is reasonably priced. Chicken strips, drinks and fries usually come out $6/person.",5

He is very competent in a field of incompetence and confusion lol. The best thing about Dante is that he is extremely available and willing to help no matter what. 

I would highly suggest him for your insurance needs....",5
4622,"I would give them a zero but it won't let me.  This place is an absolute RIP OFF! I took my car for an oil change and to get the AC checked.  I had called there other location the day before and they told me they do  ac checks for free and depending on the result it was up to me if I wanted to get the service or repairs done.  Long story short after they supposedly ran free on to check my ac they told me I had a small leak and it would be $400 to repair.  At the time I didn't have the money so I told them I would come back another day.  When I went to pick up my car they told me I had to pay $100 just for checking my AC and they went on by feeding me all this bullshit about how them checking it and using there free on to check for leaks was all worth the $100.  I took it to another mechanic and they told me they never even added the free on to check for leaks because if they had done so the ac would've blown cold for at least a day or more depending on the size of the leak.  IT NEVER BLEW COLD! Which means THEY NEVER EVEN LIFTED A FINGER to check it yet they charged me $100. I doubt they ever even did the oil change! SMH! So people please be aware of this place, it is an absolute scam ran by lazy mechanics!",1
4624,"This is the kind of place that draws you in before you even walk through the doors. And old,  white house with ""PUB"" painted in big red letters across? Awesome. I have been frequenting this establishment for years,  and it has almost ways been fun. The only time it wasn't was when some patrons hogged the pool table upstairs and wouldn't let anyone else play. However, aside from that,  the service has been great, I love their pizzas, and their emphasis on locally brewed beers. Also, beware the Goldspur. Drink it cautiously,  or you may have your worst hangover the next morning.",5

Just tried to return an item that was purchased 10 days ago at full price, still brand new with tags, and have original receipt (return policy is 14 days as many of you know). Was told by the employee ERIN ""if you want to return it, I can only give you the sale price because it's on sale now."" WHAT?!?!? 

Asked for an explanation as to why this was the case when I paid full price, never wore it, and have my receipt. I could understand if I didn't have my receipt, or if I wore it. She said ""well the item has been carried in the store for a month now."" WTH does that have to do with my situation???

Normally everyone is this store is awesome! Always extremely helpful in finding sizes and making recommendations. But ERIN has been rude once before, but this time she was over the top rude and condescending!

Erin is a Caucasian female, shoulder length blonde hair, about 5'6"", medium build. Avoid her at all costs!",1

My boyfriend and I usually order enough to have lunch and dinner the next day, which includes a pizza, chicken fingers, and a sandwich. Once in awhile, onion rings. Our regular server always leaves a pitcher of iced tea on the table for my guy, who is an iced tea camel to the highest degree, not because she doesn't have time to be back but because she knows he will down it. I cannot say enough about the service here. It has NEVER been bad.

The owner of the restaurant can often be seen talking with his guests and I have been lucky enough to chat with him for awhile. He's very nice and has a lot of standards for his restaurant. He really does care about everything in his restaurant.

Give this place a try.",5

4636,"There are lots of gyms in Henderson, but after visiting them, I chose this Anytime Fitness.  It is a small neighborhood gym with a very friendly owner and staff.  It is kept very clean.  It is not a posh gym with lots of trendy classes.  But if you are serious about working out, it's a great place to go.  I've been going to this gym for almost a year now, and I have absolutely no regrets.

Their equipment, while a bit older than the newer gyms, works extremely well.  In fact, I prefer their equipment to the newer ones as they are better at isolating particular muscle groups.  In addition, when I travel, I'm able to visit any Anytime Fitness facility.

So again, if you are serious about lifting weights and working out, this is a great place to go.  If you are looking for a social spot, please go someplace else.....",5

Todd asks if I'm going to wait or pick up I ask him how long it's going to take he says 30 min. I expected to wait up to a hour just because that's what I'm used to, over promise under deliver. 15 minutes later he says it's done!

I ordered one Rainbow Roll, one Spicy Tuna roll, miso soup and garden salad... $24 dollars¬†¬†and an upset stomach later, I'm terribly regretting my decision. This is the only sushi spot around me so I looked at Yelp, saw they had decent ratings, and placed an order. Now, I will admit - they were super speedy. They told me it would be about 10-15 minutes. I was happy to hear that. I arrived and the guy at the counter was super pleasant and even told me that he would recommend dinner menus per my suggestion. I got home, opened up my bag and looked at my meal. At first glance, it looked fine. I took a few bites of the Spicy Salmon and it didn't taste ANYTHING like it. Then figured I would move onto the Rainbow Roll. I don't know who made these rolls but they should be fired. The fish tasted old and I should have known better to keep eating it but I was really hungry. I LOVE sushi and never complain about my orders, but I promise you I will never step foot back into this place. The fish was paper thin and tasted like it was dragged across a dirty floor. I'm thoroughly disappointed with my experience and caution others from ordering the sushi there.",1
4644,"The food was delicious. I ordered the fish and chips and it was so moist on the inside but crunchy on the outside. The pepper jack cheese bites and the pretzel sticks with cheese were great!

4647,"Last night I brought my sister to Manitoba for her birthday dinner. Immediately, we were greeted by a kind waiter who offered us the option of sitting at the bar overlooking the kitchen or at a table. After explaining it was my sisters birthday he recommended the bar as a fun experience. Despite being a Wednesday night the restaurant was busy and the chef came over to us right away to explain that there were groups of food bloggers coming by the restaurant for about 1/2 hour. He apologized and assured us that it wouldn't take over the whole evening. Despite the crowd the fantastic service continued. The waiter serving drinks was able to offer recommendations and gave us a bit of history on the drink we had selected (""Gin & Jam"" was a delicious cocktail). As we looked through the menu the chef came over to us again and offered to create our menu for us. He assured us that he wouldn't ""blow the budget"" which was kind and asked us about any thing that really interested us or allergies. Being pretty adventurous eaters we gave him carte blanch and were thrilled with the result!

We tested a variety of appetizers from the menu. First, a comforting cup of cauliflower and corn soup which hit the spot followed by oysters that were incredibly fresh and delicious. We were then served an unbelievable pasta dish with smoked sturgeon and brussel sprouts. Followed by the Lamb terrine and duck hearts. The duck hearts is not something that I would typically order, however the dish was so delectable and we were happy that it made the cut. The lamb terrine was flavorful and had a fantastic texture, leaving evidence of the lamb rather than the often pureed texture found in a terrine. As our main the chef served us the venison steak with a potato rosti, and the most tasty carrots I have ever had. The steak was perfectly cooked and extremely flavorful without being overly gamey. We ended our meal with both the chocolate terrine and the sunflower cake. Both offering such amazing taste and texture combinations.

This restaurant offered more than just incredible food. The service was impeccable and the whole staff made us feel welcome and like they were cooking for us at their home. The chefs displayed an obvious passion and understanding for the food that they were sharing with their customers. With each dish came a simple explanation, which made you appreciate the food that much more. Throughout the evening we had watched the chef making the pasta and meticulously peeling the brussel sprouts and the result was well worth the tedious job. Each dish was prepared with attention to detail and in watching how much time and effort went into each preparation, there is no doubt that your meal is worth every penny. You will leave this restaurant with a overwhelming desire to return and try the rest of the menu items, but also a sense that you want to return to a place that offered a welcoming and relaxed dining experience.  I would whole heartedly recommend this restaurant and can't wait to return again soon. With a seasonal and local menu I can't wait to see what will be offered for the winter selection.",5

We decided to go back to my natural color to get rid of the mixed color in my hair.  She also did a light trim on my hair to remove the damage and also did a treatment that left my hair looking healthy and soft.  I couldn't be any more happier!!!

Here I sat, finally locked in hellacious contest with a juggernaut of ground, naturally-raised Bison and a combination of fixings that had been conjured by the dark side of my culinary imagination. With each bite I asked myself ""What have I done?""  Had I come up with a challenge too great for even my stomach? The soft baguette, a kind that differed from the chewy, crispy baguette I am used to, contained the innards of the burger as well as an aristocrat's hoagie bun could. 

Another lightning bolt epiphany struck me from the open skies as I gorged: Bison is the blood-red meat of immortal warriors, the kind served to the victorious on the battlefield and to the fallen in The Hall of the Slain. Its leanness, tenderness revealed a connection to the Earth and the ancient hunter-gatherers that once brought these behemoths of the plains down with arrow and spear. Its sweetness, richness made it fit for celestials.

The clash was grueling, the divinely homemade potato chips crunched beneath The Doomburger, conspiring to prematurely snuff out my bellyfire, but endure I did! ""IF I AM TO YAK THIS DAY, THEN MAY IT BE IN BATTLE"" I cried, channeling the dialogue of Stan Lee! 

And before I could comprehend it, the meat was gone. Only a few bites of bread, egg, American-and-Cheddar-usurping Gouda, and onion shafts remained, the sturdy, flavorful chips reduced to particles. Thus ended a battle that could have only been depicted justly by the late Jack Kirby in a 64-page comic book annual. 

The fog of Brimstone parted and two roads appeared to me. One promised milkshake pleasures of various kinds. The other was  guarded by The Ginormous Chocolate Chip Cookie Sundae and The Angels & Demons cupcakes. 

Feeling impetuous, invincible, I would take both roads. 

For days I had mulled over my milkshake choice, and the Campfire S'Mores won over the Caramel Pretzel. It came before I could gather my wits. A massive graham-cracker dusted marshmallow turret, one that couldn't have been bagged and had to have been made in-house was what I first noticed. I pulled it off and daringly devoured it. I sampled the whipped cream, which also tasted fresh, unprocessed. The ice cream itself was golden, hand-turned. The straw was hard plastic with a wide opening to allow for the s'more debris. Additional milkshake came in a large metal cup. I finished it all, ignoring my stomach's signals to walk away and marched towards the Cookie Sundae. The soft-baked cookie yielded to my fork as did the same vanilla bean ice cream. A few bites later, and I sensed defeat. I scooped the ice cream into a plastic cup and the cookie into a box. This fight would conclude another day. 

Knowing that my limit had been sufficiently taxed, I avoided Kay's cupcakes. The Burgatory logo had been drawn onto the plate in strawberry puree at the feet of an Angel Food/Chocolate Buttercream and its opposite number; Devil's Food/Vanilla Buttercream. 

Bourdain is a prophet. The top-heavy Angel Food collapsed upon my angry gaze! Hah! 

The arcane individual mentioned in Part One met us on the way out. He revealed himself to be The Owner/Adversary. When I mentioned that I nearly ate myself sick, he replied ""Gooood"" while rubbing his hands and grinning, seemingly impressed that I survived his machinations and his engines of temptation and indigestion. 

Kay and I made it out to the parking lot. 

*Caution. The following passage is graphic. The circumstances are entirely my own fault.*

I tried to fight it off. This hadn't happened to me in ten years and never before due to overindulgence. 

I vomited ice cream, cold ice cream, onto the asphalt. I had become a human soft serve dispenser. The Owner's cacophonous cackling deluged the lot and tormented my ears. I had finally eaten myself nauseous. I had been made into a glutton.

Kay just giggled, and I felt fine afterwards. No one else saw me spew. From there we made our way home. The next morning, I quietly finished the sundae. The ice cream had since hardened in the icebox. The cookie, after being nuked, reached the consistency of a pancake. I didn't mind and ate slowly. It was Sunday morning, and the nightmare was over. 

Pit your soul against the most lightless powers of cookery fathomable. Confront the horrors that lie within Burgatory. You will emerge from the ordeal a stronger being.

P.S. I forgot to mention that this song was playing on the Liquid Metal satellite radio station as we searched for Burgatory. I SWEAR!  Eerie foreshadowing?

4654,"Horrible place...not that I didn't knew this from before but continue to use then when I just need a quick fix...first of all I get spa owned by Indian girl.

Attending to another person and answer the phone too.unprofessional...finally I asked for the facial was bombarded with a phamplet for some oxygen facial..cost 150$ per visit and you have to do six...I said lady all I need is a regular facial with a peel or something to get rid of the dead skin...she kept insisting on the 150$√ó6. I said to her I want the one with the microdermbrasion for $80 supposedly some machine with diamond tip...no not the worst part..
I lay down on their makeshift bed that's rocking I swear if it had broken it wud have been a lawsuit I mention it to the girl all she did was ""gigglehhehe"" I don't thing she understand a word I told her.  Finally on the bed..she started the facial first step was a warm towel altho the towel was soaked it was so hard I cud feel it bruising my face..that because it is washed out and dried out..it fucking old and smell like eggs...yes rank! After that was a massage with Wat smelt like Jasmin oil...them it was wiped again...then the was a 3 minutes steam cap blowing in my nose...that cause they don't take pride in Wat they r doing or ask customers was comfortable for them.

4660,"I took my Yorkie to MKB for basic obedience training when she was a puppy and I was not impressed with Dorothy nor her training method.

My dog was the smallest dog in the class and Dorothy constantly picked on her, calling her a 'spoiled princess' repeatedly and using negative training styles which neither I nor my dog appreciated.  I have since trained her at positive reinforcement classes and she has done great!  She loved the positive reinforcement classes and picked up the skills very quickly.  In Dorothy's class, my dog did not even learn to sit - she was terrified of Dorothy and the punishments.  

My dog has a sweet temperament and has never met a soul she didn't like except Dorothy.  We dropped out of the classes midway through and switched to another training school and it was a great decision!

Perhaps if you have a big dog, this class may be more suitable for you.  I felt that Dorothy had a negative attitude toward small dogs.",1
4662,"Food is everything it was hyped to be. Clear, sharp flavors and in particular the texture of the meats was just perfect. Boneless duck crispy fried to perfection, luxuriously melting short ribs that still didn't taste greasy, and dry sausage that was redolent of chiles and lime.

Service was very good and our waiter knew the menu inside and out, answering every one of my questions. The service is also very fast.

The inside of the restaurant is nice enough - not modern or hip in any way but nicer than your average Thai. The location is straight ghetto, but never fear, you'll be accompanied by a steady stream of taxis, limos, and others making the sojourn this many blocks from the Strip. It's not a secret, this place.

The only flaw - a minor one in the scheme of things - is that the prices were a bit high for the amount of food ordered. The portions are quite modest. You will need to order at least one entree per adult and possibly more.

Is this the best Thai I've ever eaten? I don't know - it was pretty darn good. And a lot of the dishes simply aren't available at your nearest Thai joint. Experiment a little - this is not the place to get panang curry and pad thai, even if they happen to be really good.

This is a definite keeper, and we'll definitely be back next time we're in town.",5
4663,"THIS IS WHAT I CALL A DINER!!!!!

There are two ways you can have a dream diner:

** Strategy A: Go All Out New Jersey With a 1000 Page Menu

New Jersey diner menus are huge.

There is no American or Italian or Jewish or Greek dish they ain't got and a lot of them have Mexican too.

The execution is generally solid if not especially remarkable - but your comfort is that you were given the entire world to choose from.

The Danger of a Bad New Jersey Diner: 

The cook is a fleabag and the dish or the ingredients have been sitting in the back for a long time. 

Leftovers for dinner again?????

***Strategy B: Go All Out Legendary Execution on Rediscovered Classics 

Ok, the Menu is normal sized, but the food is so good!

There is an excellent cook. Not only are the classic dishes resplendent, but there are lots of innovative touches, and new dishes the cook has come up with.
 
Your breakfast or your dinner is wonderful, marvelous, fantastic.

The Danger of a Bad Legendary Execution Diner: 

Pretentiousness. 

""Our landmark gastronomic establishment serves locally sourced eggs signed by the chickens themselves, locally sourced spinach personally tested by Popeye, and locally sourced sausage made from the meat of consenting pigs. Customer, remember you are having the AUTHENTIC NORTH AMERICAN DINING EXPERIENCE.""

There is a financial aid officer to help you with the tab.

...............................................

Diner Deluxe is a superb superb Plan B small menu great execution diner.

And there is not a drop of pretentiousness in the place.

They even make fun of other pretentious la-dee-dah diners such as OEB which is one block away. 

Diner Deluxe has a white board offering gag items such as $1000 Financier Caviar and Champagne and $800 Trust Fund Kid 100 point wine. 

So Diner Deluxes' heart is in the right place.

How is their cooking?

OMG. Totally totally OMG.

My wife had an eggs benedict for the gods, with the most orange yolk on a poached egg I have ever seen, and an absolutely perfect firm non-runny but not hard boiled texture. Mild restrained hollandaise sauce that had no touch of the kill-the-flavor-of-the-rest-of-your-food-with-loudmouth-hollandaise that is generally the curse of amateur benedict makers. A very classy touch was flash sauteeing the capers in butter - which takes the acid out and makes them mellow and remarkable.

I had a wacky three ingredient breakfast and hit paydirt three out of three times.

A tomato bisque off the lunch menu was pure tomato magic with cooked in subtle garlic and herb flavors.

Maple sugar beans (yeah these are weird pairings) - were totally original and avoided all of the flaws of bad home-made diner beans. Unlike the soupy, overly wet, overly sweet mush that passes for baked beans in most places - these baked beans were dry dry dry. There was no sauce. The beans were firm and had strong bean taste. AND they had a subtle touch of sweetness that came from an absolutely restrained use of maple syrup as well as the savory heft of well-cooked-down tomatoes. An absolute triumph of a dish!

But the star of the show was what they call ""a parfait"". This is yogurt, and flavored mascarpone (kept separate on your plate) along with a good homemade granola and fresh good northwestern mixed berries. Mix together and eat.

What set this apart from a standard yogurt granola and fruit combo you get at the grocery store was

a) a very restrained amount of yogurt, so the dish stayed firm and solid.

b) flavored mascarpone to give the yogurt freshness and interest.

c) super-high quality fresh berries.

It was like eating a creamy berry pancake.

I was in heaven.

The coffee was fine.

The crowd was young graduate-student-y and cool.

(The handful of older folks in the place came accompanied by adult sons and daughters. The oldsters all looked like global warming researchers.)

Service was friendly and excellent,

and the prices were very reasonable.

You have paid far more elsewhere and gotten far less.

Diner Deluxe is an absolutely solid six-star must-visit establishment!",5
4664,"Loved Joe's Stone Crab.  Service was terrific, staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and fun.",5
4667,"I enjoyed the Cabin in the Woods room so much, that I will definitely be going back with my friends very soon to hopefully get out of the room this time and I look forward to trying all the new rooms that are coming soon!  Much, much harder than I anticipated!  This place is perfect for date nights, large groups and work events.  I just wish they gave you two hours instead of one!!!",5
4669,"amazing tacos. always has tequilas for shots of the days. what a great deal! the tortas are legit too. the elote dip was interesting. a bit too cheesy than a traditional elote, but definitely a good place to visit for brunch or happy hour",5
4670,"My newest, most favorite place to hangout. My fianc√© and I come here all the time and have really enjoyed getting to know some of the servers/bartenders. They're always on top of food orders and the bartenders are great for beer knowledge (especially IPA's for my fianc√©). 
We LOVE happy hour; the prices are great and after every visit we go home full and happy. 
We like the wings, Capri salad and every pizza we've tried. It's really phenomenal. 
Honorable mentions are Chris, Gene and Robert -- all who we have had the opportunity to see after their shifts at one point or another and they're great people. 
Looking for good eats and food? Worth trying. It's delicious and the service is always great!
**try the purple haze, it's yummy and popular!**",5
4672,We visited this place with friends and really love it . It's very interesting . You gonna like it ! Atmosphere and idea is amazing ! HIGLY RECOMMEND!,5
4673,"I Love Love Love Oregano's.  When I lived abroad I was terribly homesick for this place and to be honest, the thought of living further than an hour's drive from Oregano's puts me into a panic.

The food is Delicious and Generous and the prices are SUPER reasonable.  The Alfredo the Dark with chicken is wonderful, and my staple.  I especially like the roasted poblano chile on top, which oddly varies in degrees of hotness depending on the day.  There was one time that I happily snarfed the pepper only to realize a minute later that my lips were ON FIRE.  Like, I had to ice them for the next 20 minutes.  Still, I take full responsibility for that silliness and recommend that everyone be Very Careful when eating those little guys.  The salads are great, the belinis are yummy- the staff is crazy friendly, which would usually annoy the hell out of me but I find it oddly endearing.  *sigh* I cannot wax poetic enough!",5
4675,"This place is amazing! A wonderful hole in the wall, with utterly delicious and unique food in the Vegas valley. I ordered the meat and cheese pasty, it was cooked to order and the crust was tender and flaky, the filling the interior was so yummy, it was good enough without the red wine gravy, but if you know what's good for you, try that gravy! It's like noneother I've had before. A hip, casual place with a great beer selection..plus Blackthorne cider ON TAP. Now, I thnk I have a new place to nosh for a great meal!",5
4676,"Just stopped by this little place for lunch and loved it! We frequent this shopping center a lot and have tried almost all of the restaurants in here. In our opinion, the best food can be found in this little part of the shopping center. Between AZ Kabob's and Mr. Mesquite's, there is no need to go anywhere else. The tortillas were fresh and delicious, the steak had a nice mesquite flavor, all of the ingredients were fresh, and they had a salsa bar to top it off! The staff was friendly and everything was nice and clean. I imagine if they keep up with their quality ingredients and cleanliness they will be a very successful business!",5
4677,I thought I had been to the worst bww here in socal...move over this spot took its place. We walked in and where seated.(it was pretty empty) we waited about 10-15 minutes for our server to come out and take our order just for drinks. She later took our order. I had this feeling that food was not going to be up to par and sure enough I was right.  I ordered a sampler to start the portions givin where small compared to other times I've gotten this. The onion rings made me sad soggy and small. Cold cheese sticks and wings along side a soggy side of nachos. Then the dipping sauces where barly half full not enough imo. Lucky I just passed through and won't have to visit this place agian I feel bad for the locals i feel they won't the the true bww experience.,1
4681,"I really LOVE this place!  I've been here twice for pizza, and once for pasta and I must say that this spot really takes the cake for atmosphere, cleanliness, quality of food, and customer service.

The place is always spotless when I walk in, the servers are always in a good mood, there is always more than enough space to sit and enjoy my food (I usually go early for lunch though, so I'm not sure how they handle dinner service), and the dishes are delicious! Even the prices are phenomenal!!!

I love having this beautifully tucked-away gem all to myself when I'm craving Italian for lunch! 

I highly recommend this place to everybody, and I look forward to sampling the entire menu!",5
4682,awesome job!!!  had them do a vehical wrap on commercial business vehicle.  did such an awesome job i had them do plastidip on my 4x4 truck.  affordable pricing and friendly service.  delivered on time and better then expected quality,5
4683,"My wife and I were in Vegas staying at the Delano (a part of Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino), and we decided we wanted pizza.  We found Pizzalicious after googling and decided to give it a shot.  Without a doubt, it is one of the best restaurants for pizza I've ever experienced.  The veggie pizza with its scrumptious garlic-coated crust was so good, we went back the next day for a second round of pizza before we drove back to LA.  

If you want an excellent pizza made by a true New Yorker, visit Pizzalicious.  You will come away completely satisfied with a desire to go back for more.",5
4685,This places stays busy. And you may have to wait a while for a table due to this is a smaller restaurant. That is the hard part waiting for a table while you are surrounded with such a wonderful smell of the food cooking.  Well worth the wait food is delicious.  Great friendly wait staff.,5
4686,My husband & I have been here several times this month and everything was cooked perfectly!  I am now recommending to try it out again. Several years back I swore to never go back but gave them another chance...we are making it a date night once a month now!  I want to try everything!  Fast and friendly service with good coffee.,5
4688,This was our first time at Harbour 60 and it was incredible. Our server was Fred L and we were table 39. I have never had such fabulous service in my life. We have been to several 5 star restaurants including Ruth Crist's and this is the best in the city.,5

They recently helped me get a repair covered under my warranty when the factory did not want to do it.  They go above and beyond.  On top of that, they always give me a nice car to drive while they are servicing my car and they wash my car as well.",5
4692,"Great service; our server checked in us several times and offered us drinks, apps, and desert.  The manager also came by our table. The food was fresh and the buffet area was very clean. Awesome experience!",5

4696,"I had been wanting to try this place for years. It is hard to please my Asian boyfriend when not at a traditional Asian restaurant. He played it safe and ordered chicken fried rice and it got his deal of approval. I had the Hawaiian Fire chicken bowl with fried rice and two of the spring rolls. The chicken was thoroughly coated with sauce, crunchy and the inside was fresh, light, and tender. The spring rolls were very tasty. Can't wait to come back.",5
4697,Great hotel! It's  a happy positive energy kinda place. It offerings are very unique and fun which sets it apart from other hotels.  Live check in at the bar which includes a signature cocktail. The room had a love sac for a sofa which was extremely comfortable. Being able to play a guitar in the room was very cool. I can't forget to mention the selfvator. Creative and fun!!,5
4699,There was a bit of a wait for us to get in on a Thursday night but from reading previous reviews I expected this.  The wait staff was phenomial. Everyone was suuuper nice and helpful. The sushi was good and they had a decent variety of rolls to choose from. Over great experience,5
4703,"Super small inside. We went with a group of 8 and took up at least one-third of the dining area. Loved the look of the outdoor patio, but too warm for us to hang out there. Food was delish! And the service was wonderful. We'd definitely eat here again should we find ourselves in that area. =)",5
4706,"Love the service, food, and environment. You get to pick the healthy side menu or the happy side menu. They dont have soda here but they offer fresh juices but its kidna pricey. The only negative i experienced was when my wife and I were eating at the patio the guy was cleaning the floor infront of us and I thought it was kinda rude because of the dust flying around. If you like being healthy i recommend eating here.",5
4711,"In contrast to the Gladstone's claims that their karaoke is 'the best' in the city, at most it's now nothing more than a self-important kj, with very little stage presence but LOTS of rudeness putting on some songs. This is a VERY different vibe from the days when Peter Styles presided over the stage with his flash, black tie-ish attire and his famous applause sign that he would hold high behind a singer's back to pump up the crowd. Why they got rid of him is a question that defies comprehension, but I will say that they're right in calling this latest incarnation ""shameless karaoke"", as one would need to have some semblance of shame to continue on with this pale copy of the glory that once was karaoke at The Gladstone.",1
4715,"I am so grateful to have found this office! I needed to see a Dermatologist for my rosacea. The care regimen and creams they prescribed have really helped. Everyone there was very nice and I waited only 3 minutes to be seen. The office is beautiful. The Doctor really listened to everything I said. I couldn't be happier, I wish every Doctor appointment was like this one was!",5
4716,"Based on recommendations from three colleagues, I decided to get my rings re-designed at Josephine's Jewellery. I was impressed with the personal service from the time I walked in. Josie helped me pick the style I wanted and to figure out what gold colour looked best on my skin. She even provided me with a free appraisal and gave instructions on how to care for my rings. My custom-made rings are so beautiful and I would definitely go there for all my jewellery purchases.",5
4717,"Moon! Thank you for a great time!

My ears popped on the way up since the elevator goes up so darn fast. The doors opened and right away it was to the bar! They made my Washington Apple just oh so yummy yet still strong so I was definitely happy!

We met a guy from Germany and I helped him get up to Moon so he bought a round of drinks. Starting off a club with a free round of drinks is ALWAYS a good thing! The music was good too which always adds to a fun time. I met a fun group of girls which is rare! Good people, good drinks, and just an all around good time. 

Pauly D from Jersey Shore happened to be spinning but I must say the music was awesome! I'm not sure if it was just the fun atmosphere, people, drinks, or all of the above but he was playing some old school and recent songs and it was all good. He even threw in some Jersey Shore talk and I found it to be hilarious. LOL!

Definitely good times, a great view, and I loved it!

I dislike the elevator ride up but it must be done.",5
4718,"Might be the worst vinyl focused store I've been into. I'd say 80% of the records, including the whatever Beatles records in the ""collectibles"" box are beat to heck (and five times the price they should be for the condition). They didn't put records in plastic sleeves. Beat 80s pop records that should be $1-2 in NM/NM shape are $6.50, but hey, there is a buy one get one half price, or something like that special. Really, the dregs of records. I flipped a little bit but there was absolutely nothing. Most of these records should be dumpstered. I'm super pro indie record stores, but sometimes when three other stores pass on stuff there is a reason it shouldn't be put out.",1
4719,"Picante is the best!! Friendly staff, great location, and quality food with robust flavors.  One of the best deals in town - their $5 burrito bowl. Chipotle, Moe's, and Phat Burrito won't be seeing me again.",5
4720,"Didn't stay here but visited for dinner & the  'entertainment' - if you can call it that.  Got swindled by Tix4Tonight into getting buffet tickets 'at a HUGE discount' (according to them) which turned out to be....$3 off.  Er.  Ok, whatever - it's a buffet, they're all the same right? 

Wrong.

The Buffet (as it's known in the casino/hotel) was small, not very clean and filled with loud people seated too close together.  We saw our server exactly twice.  The food was meh - uninspired, overcooked and cooling rapidly beneath awkwardly spaced bars.  The dessert bar was the only highpoint - it was decently filled with a wide selection of mini & regularly sized sweet things - bread pudding, pies, cakes, donuts, cookies, ice cream & cotton candy.  

The main free 'entertainment' - and I use the term loosely - at Treasure Island is the revamped pirate ship show outside on the Strip called ""Sirens of TI"".  The plot  was non-existent, the music & badly lipsync-ed lyrics were a joke, the choreography executed with lackluster synchronization by the barely dressed-by-Frederick's-of-Hollywood female cast.   The last was possibly the only good thing (for the men) in the audience.   Surely not for the many children attending the show with their irresponsible parents.  

Gilly's bar, inside the casino near the Siren Cove, has a bull to ride but don't try to watch through the windows...security  will quickly come by and board up the windows from the inside.  Way to go, guys - that's a GREAT way to draw people inside.",1
4721,"Yea, it's a Wendy's but great service! Usually when you're in an airport the service is rude, good thrown together, and extremely overpriced. The line was long and they were busy and the employees were always smiling and pleasant. Not that obnoxious fake pleasant either. They were genuine. The food was great! They do charge 31 cents per ranch but that's corporates policy, not theirs.",5
4722,I went here on March 2nd and the gals were great and the burrito enchilada was fantastic. There's no way you leave here hungry. It cost me around $15 but I had plenty to eat with leftovers for the next day.  It's less if you don't have guacamole and sour cream but ya gotta have that   highly recommend,5
4724,"This is the worst car rental place I have ever been too, rude people, substandard cars. I waited 45 minutes to be picked up at Viscount (I had already taken a train to get there) and they never came. Ultimately, a different car company took me. AVOID!!!!!",1
4725,"Delicious and giant burgers. Toasted buns, home made pickles and yummy crinkle cut fries. We ordered this for delivery from the yelp app and it arrived on time, fresh and hot. What a great find!",5
4727,"I'm not a very handy guy,  so when I go someplace like Home Depot,  I really need some guidance.   On this trip,  I was looking for a 24x24in plywood board and didn't know where to start.   When I asked the guys in the lumber department,  they knew right where to direct me,  and they even cut the board to the size I needed.   I'll always pick Home Depot over other hardware stores because of experiences like that.",5
4728,The best food I've ever eaten in my life. And $5 pitchers of craft beer is pure sorcery! How can you resist? I literally licked my plate after eating the country toast for brunch.,5
4729,"Worst service ever, food was hard and not that good, waited forever for my check. The lady only came by my table once. Spoke to the manger he did nothing for us. Food over priced. I will not be going back not worth it",1
4730,Terrible! The biker bouncer guy physically put his hands on me because I was eating a taco in line to buy a pizza. Such an asshole. I will never walk in his place again. Extremely downgrading to females!,1
4733,Being an Italian food snob I must say this place was the bomb!!! I have made a lot of Italian food and have eaten at several Italian restaurants and this one is the real deal!!! If you want the huge plate of cooked dried pasta that would feed an army vs an authentic homemade Italian dish then this place is not for you... this food is so delicious and authentic!!! Our waiter Tait was amazing !!! I love this place and will for sure be back the next time we are in Vegas!!!,5
4734,Holy fuck bud where do I start with this shit hole. First of all they only give you like half a shot in mixed drinks. The upstairs area smells like ass and has loose bags of blow everywhere. Not to mention there's a shooting or stabbing there every week.,1

4741,"Ordered through uber eats, food arrived 1.5 hours later. I order a maki set with sashimi combo for me and my guest. We were hungry and staring at the uber eats app as no driver picked up the food until 1 hour later and took 30 minutes to drive 2 km. My food has been sitting there for who knows how long. I don't think anyone wants to eat sashimi raw fish that's sitting on the counter and in the delivery drivers car for 1.5 hours. 


While I was sitting here hungry and waiting for my order, not once I got some type of call/notification from restaurant or uber driver regarding the extreme lateness. I don't blame everything on the driver. Restaurant has to be responsible for coordinating their business with uber.

The food was very soggy by the time I got it from the uber eats driver. Perhaps it would've been better if it didn't take so long to reach the customer. I'm giving 1 stars because the food was still in edible condition. 

I don't really recommend this place. If you do end up ordering, order 1.5 to 2 hours in advance. If you don't want to eat your dinner at 10:30pm at night.

Overall, spent $40 with tax and delivery charge for soggy food. Messaged and Called uber, uber said they don't give a sh*t. No refund or apology from Uber or Restaurant. Awful experience.


Stay away from ordering from here!",1
4742,"It is said that life is short, eat dessert first. I may do that next time I go to B&R. I have found the world's best lemon meringue pie there . The meringue and lemon are amazing and made with fresh real ingredients-nothing artificial. But, the crust...ohhh the crust!! I will surely be making late night runs for it. 

On my first visit, I just wanted to try some of the unique sushi choices. I have been to some of the best sushi bars in Tokyo and Osaka. The sushi was beautifully presented and amazing to the taste. The sushi will also be on my late night runs back to B&R. 

One more thing to make this wonderful new restaurant a unique treat. The energy and authenticity that Laura and Kate bring to B&R adds to the full experience.

As Arnold said, I'll be back!!!",5
4745,"Typical Monday..... I stopped into this location this morning after I ran over something on the highway, on my way to work. I could hear the hissing of my tire, dying a very slow death. Thankfully, I have full warranties on all four tires so after checking in with these guys, my problem was fixed within 25 minutes! Got to work 30 minutes late but that was about 45 minutes earlier than I had originally anticipated! They were fast, friendly, and I obviously love that I didn't have to pay anything. Take THAT, Monday! Ha!

Side note: I was very impressed that their bathrooms were clean and included changing tables for the babies! It's a task to find a damn changing table in half of the restaurants out here in Vegas, so this company is winning in my book!",5
4746,"This has been my store for about a year but I guess I will be going to a different one now.  For the past couple of months,  the bakery has been out of cherry turnovers. First I was told they had no lead baker, but would be hiring a new one.  Now they have this ""new"" baker,  and I still haven't seen turnovers for over a month.  Mind you,  that may seem silly to you,  but it's my ONE treat for the weekend. They said they only order so much, etc. I spoke with the manager, who said he'd look into it-twice!!  Still no change.  So that tells me my bisiness isn't important to them! Say bye-bye to several hundred a month from me...just because your bakers don't know how to order! The checkers suggest calling and having them hold for me but why should I have to do that?? Just order enough product that all your customers can purchase...especially on Friday!",1
4747,We came in on a busy Sunday for Breakfast. Their was a wait for a table with our large table but thats usually a good sign. Once we were sat we had prompt service from beginning to end. I love that we had our own coffee carafe :) The cinnamon roll was delicious with a cream cheese frosting and the food we all had was perfect. The Benedict was delicious and the creeps were a hit. Overall great experience. Thank you :),5
4748,"We ordered the Long Island Grandma and it was excellent! My daughter proclaimed ""This is my new favorite pizza!"" We need to try more items but our first experience was bang on!",5
4750,"I love this place!  Growing up within walking distance to 3 bakeries this was always my favorite.  Hasn't changed a bit in the 40 years I have been going there, still handwriting the receipts.  

Really like the apple dump cakes and no big event in my family would be complete without one of their date nut sheet cakes.",5
4752,"I just picked up an order from this location & was extremely excited to try a new lunch spot. Needless to say I will not be dining here ever again. I was almost there to pick up my order & received a phone call to tell me they only had enough broccoli & cheddar soup for a cup not a bowl. (I had one order of the cup & one bowl) I took this as my co-worker was just going to be getting a cup now instead of a bowl. I notice on my drive back that there was only one cup inside the bag. (Thank God Panera was on my drive back). 

Willing to overlook the miscommunication I opened up my chicken chipotle wrap a monsoon of what appeared to might of been the chipotle ranch? came tumbling onto my lap, I couldn't pick the wrap up it was so soggy & all the condiments inside were soggy, it honestly was one of the worst things I've indulged in. Furious, I am now starving for the last 4 hours of my day & out of $12. I truly hope someone tries to make this right , I see potential in this establishment. Running out of soup at 1:00pm & selling non edible food isn't a great start to success.",1
4755,I had a great experience at Greulich's. I used the snap financing for new tires for my car. Their customer service was excellent!  I would definitely recommend them.,5
4757,"I'm from Las Vegas where most nail salons are amazing, so living in Pittsburgh for the last 4 months I've had trouble finding one that compares. I'm so sad I found this place right before moving back. This place is super clean and everyone is super friendly. My pedicure was amazing. I wish I would've found this salon months ago! I'm super happy with both my pedi and mani and the prices are super affordable!",5
4758,"Love it!
Dinner here was excellent and the service was terrific!

Our group ordered all of the appetizers and each one was really good.  We even shared the Mushroom Cappucino, it was a great conversation booster and provided a lot of laughs.

Everyone enjoyed their dinner - chicken & waffles, ribeyes, and my personal favorite the special - angel hair pasta, cream sauce, scallops, apples, and bacon - YUM!

The desserts were delicious too!  I had the chocolate cake!  It hit the spot!",5
4759,Awesome food and great service!  The water tasted weird so the owner/manager came out and personally apologized and offered us free sodas...we are usually a carbonated drink-free family but it was awesome that a business owner was so eager to accommodate his customers. We also liked the atmosphere.  It was simple but clean and didn't smell like fried food like what I've experienced in some small restaurants.  We will definitely be returning. They also DELIVER so I know where my family and I will be eating on our lazy days!!,5
4761,"Fast delivery, food was fresh, hot, and very good. Would definitely order from here again and also would recommend to my friends. I've had pizza, wings, and zucchini sticks.",5

4763,Good curry. Liked the thai style spider roll. Wife said the chinese was good. something for everyone you should try it!,5
4764,"After reading some questionable reviews from know it all nit wits, I would like to say that my sister and I have been loyal patrons of Shogun for many years. You will not find better sushi in Toronto, that is a fact. The prices are very reasonable considering the level of freshness, quality and culinary skill. While I can see that the servers sometimes might not be what Toronto foodies may be used to, keep in mind that the waitresses actually prepare and put together a lot of the appetizers, soups and much more themselves. They are also very friendly and very accommodating. I have yet to find a restaurant that has served me with the consistent perfection that shogun has shown over the years.",5
4765,"I drive an old '94 Jeep Wrangler that has well over 200K miles and still going strong because I keep up on maintence with quality parts and since  I am a former professional mechanic I do all the work myself. About a week ago I had my tires rotated and noticed my rear brakes were soaked in oil, I needed my brakes replaced right away but I work night shift and didn't have time to do it for another few days so a quick search showed Brake Masters was the closest to my location but closed in less then an hour. I called and explained what I needed done and they told me to bring it in and they would stay late to get it fixed. I got there at about 5pm and they got my Jeep right in and started checking out what needed done, they close at 5:30 and would have stayed late to get the repairs done but my brake drums they couldn't get until the next day so I opted to leave it overnight and had them replace the rear wheel bearings, seals, brakes,drums, and oil change. 
They had all the repairs done by 11am the next morning and I couldn't be happier with the service. I am very selective who I let work on my Jeep and these guys, at this shop have earned my future business for all of my vehicles.",5
4768,Staff was friendly and my Pedicure looked great for a month! I would highly recommend this nail salon.  I just wish it were closer to my house.  It was also very clean!,5
4770,"I think that even giving this location 1 star is being generous. Being a first time parent, I appreciate all the customer service I can get. I've gone into this store several times, unfortunately due to necessity, but there were 2 crucial trips there where I received ZERO service.
First crucial visit was to shop for car seats, no help, no acknowledgement.
Second visit to look at pack n play's was on a weeknight where service was slow. Barely any customers, but several employees on the floor. We asked for help twice with absolutely no success. 
I'd much rather drive my ass to Brookfield, WI and visit Buy Buy Baby.

Get this store under new management please.",1
4771,I had pretty much every burger in almost every restaurant  this one of the one of the best Sunnyside burger and truffle fries I ever had and the service felt like a five star restaurantand .. I applaud the management for training  their staff  very very well hats off to a server Carlos great experience thank you,5
4772,"Excellent customer service! However I went in for a tire repair and I was told my tire was unrepairable and I needed to buy a new one. I ended up leaving and going to Discount Tire, where they repaired my tire for free. Bottom line is, if you're a female go to a different repair shop or there may be a possible chance that you could get bamboozled .",1
4773,"If you are looking for a New Mexican cuisine look no more! This place is amazing! Had brunch this Sunday and paul, Chris, and Elena  delivered top notch service! The pork verde with eggs was great and if you like jalape√±o bacon you will not be let down. If you don't know now you do, they have the best margaritas in town!",5
4774,"Highly recommend! By far my favorite pizzeria since we moved to the area. I can honestly say that I enjoy this pizza more than some of the pizzerias in NY, where we originally lived. The slices are massive, and very filling. The sauce is amazing. We have also ordered wings and the wings are absolutely delicious. The only thing I wish they added on their menu is chicken rolls because I love chicken rolls and it is a common thing sold in pizzerias, but unfortunately they do not make them.",5
4775,"This place is HUGE!!! It has a great selection of all kinds of interesting items (including a mayonnaise maker...who knew they used to have to make that by hand?) We thoroughly enjoyed wandering the aisles and peering into display cases...so much so that we ended up spending about 3 hours here! My husband found these ""cool"" (I call them creepy) canisters and an awesome old lamp. I found a sewing machine drawer, old pencils, and some old games, and jewelry. We will definitely be back next time we're in the area!",5
4776,"Avoid this Hertz at all costs!  I rented a car for a couple weeks and was charged almost $400 for additional insurance even though I specifically told the employee (I believe her name was Kim) that I had my own car insurance and did not want to purchase additional insurance.  When she gave me a quote, I asked why I had to pay additional fees as I booked through Orbitz.  She assured me that this was just a ""preauthorization...don't worry about it, it'll be removed once you return the card.""  She seemed a little sketchy but it was almost 11 PM and I was exhausted and decided to trust her.  2 weeks later, I returned the car and the attendant notified me of a nearly $400 charge.  I told him that the employee assured me it was a credit card preauthorization but he explained to me that it looks as though she charged me for additional insurance.  I went upstairs to talk to a customer service employee however the line to speak to someone was extremely long.  There was, however, a employee (Bryan) who was monitoring the lines.  I explained to him my situation and although he was nice, he said that he could not reverse the transaction but would contact the employee and would contact me within 2 business days.  

4 days went by and I heard nothing.  But the 5th day, I called the number he requested that I call and was given the run around.  I spent 2 hours on the phone and spoke to 3-4 different people who kept transferring me to another person.  They seemed completely apathetic.  Finally they transferred me to a employee in lost and found.  She was confused how she ended up with my call.  I told her my situation and out of everyone I spoke to, she was the most understanding and said she would speak to her manager.  An hour later, I get a phone call from Bryan who said that he did speak to the employee (Kim) and that ""she doesn't remember you but she said she never overcharged you.""  To which I replied, ""if she doesn't remember me, then how could she possibly make that statement.""  The conversation lasted almost an hour and it was like talking to a broken record.  He repeatedly said that there was no way anybody could reverse the transaction.  I told him this was BS.  He then admitted that this issue has been a problem and they are attempting to resolve this overcharge issue.  But regardless, there was no way for me to get a refund. 

10 minutes after I got off the phone with Bryan, I receive another phone call from him.  He said he spoke to his manager (even though when we met, he said that he was ""one of the managers"").   He assured me that he would put in a request for a full refund.  2 months later, I get a refund.  But it was to no surprise that I only received approximately 35% returned.  And to this very day, I continue to get the run around and no one returns my phone calls. 

This was a complete rip off.  Buyer beware: Even if you tell them you want to use your insurance, some of the employees there apparently will still add on the insurance plan and you will be charged for it.  I'm not sure if the employees get some kind of perk/commission for over-selling but its pretty obvious that they have shady policies.  I have utilized almost every car rental company in the Sky Harbor Terminal (yes, even the companies one would think would adopt sketchy practices) and I have never encountered an issue like this before.  It is absolutely disappointing in addition to being completely unethical.",1
4777,I went here needing help with carpet and they helped me out so much!! So many places to choose carpet from here in Vegas and I would come back here. Hands down. They exceeded my expectations for sure! Thanks guys!,5
4778,"Taste wise, this is easily one of the best new places I've eaten at in quite some time.  Smoke is very easy to miss / hard to find, as it's on East 8th Avenue, which is the main road that runs through Homestead.  It's not located in the Waterfront area.

I absolutely love this place.  It's very informal inside, as there are only 4 tables and a few seats at the bar, and you pay your bill at a register.   This place definitely needs to expand, which I think it will.  The demand for the food is way too high for a restaurant this size, and every time I've been here there were double the number of people waiting than there were eating.

Anyways, to the food.  The menu is simple, with 8 or so different tacos (all soft tortillas) on the menu.  There are a few sides and a few specialty drinks.  I've tried just about everything on the menu and everything was amazing.  I really don't know what else to say.   Everything tastes fresh, and is not overly seasoned or salty. 

REMINDER:  IF YOU EAT HERE, YOU MUST TRY THE MAC AND CHEESE.",5
4782,"I would give them negative stars if I could! I bought a $500 toshiba laptop and a $1200 dell from this place. Both absolute rubbish! The toshiba died after 3 months of use, and the dell died after barely 5 months of use. Same error for both: unmountable boot  error. The geek squad guy was awful when I took in the toshiba and was very condescending, as if I was some sort of idiot(I'm an engineering student in my senior year so I know a little about technology). 

He said he would fix it for $300 (what?!). He said I must have done something to it. Um I don't think so, I have a 7 year old HP that still works decently that I bought from Office Depot yet somehow both the laptops from this store seem to not work and show the same error. This place is a scam! I am positive they sell refurbished junk at full price. I will never shop at Best Buy again nor will I recommend them to anyone!",1
4783,"Very disappointed ,ordered large and the tried giving me medium . Made them do them again  . while they where making them we seen the guy making our pizza reach for his phone  hope the manager puts the on check  once again very disappointed.",1
4785,Love this Shave Ice!  My favorite is the root beer with ice cream on the bottom and sweetened condensed milk on top. The Dreamcicle is so good too. Sizes are HUGE!!!  So many flavors and toppings to choose from!,5
4786,"First time here and I would not recommend this restaurant. They are a burger restaurant, but the burgers are terrible. They told me they only cook the burgers one way which was medium well........you're a burger place and can only cook the burgers one way? Makes no sense to me. Anyways, the burger came out and was extremely dry and the bun was burnt. Such a shame cause the restaurant is beautiful. Not going back.",1
4787,"After waiting an hour and a half after my appointment.  He tells me that he has 2 others that he did not know I was coming. Dude, I'm here waiting.  I will not be coming back to this place.  The worst customer service ever!!!",1
4789,"Ive lived here for over a year and watched people struggle in the parking lots. I just got off the phone with Rita in the office discussing the parking lot repavement which is unnecessary. But to my surprise they had no game plan for the extra residents that would be left with out parking. For the price u pay to live in these cheap poorly crafted apartments they should be paving the roads for us. But instead we get cheap free breakfast, every piece of equipment is broken in the club house, and careless management. They have no problem taking ur money but when u need help Rita in the office will give u attitude. I can't wait to move to a place that recycles.",1
4792,"The food had a lot of oil, and wasn't that impressive. Maybe next time I'll try again, and see. Stay tuned.",1
4795,"Nope, never again. I got a bloody burger!!!! Why? Is well done so difficult??? On top of that, it's a cramped place. They are trying to fit far too many tables into square footage that makes it feel cramped, uncomfortable, and stifling. On a positive, and my only reason for the one star is the drinks were good and our server was awesome. 
Still won't come back, though.",1
4797,"We Ubered from our hotel because we wanted a good breakfast place outside the standard Vegas strip and our hotel.  It was good drive there, BUT WORTH IT!

Great portions!  I had loco moco, not your standard breakfast but oh so yummy!  Also ordered a bloody Mary and it was awesome!  

Service was friendly and fast!  Waiter had lots of recommendations, so you couldn't go wrong.  We had a table of 7 and everyone LOVED their choices for breakfast.  

Good value, good portions, great service!  It's a definite return when we come back!",5

4808,"I seldom give any business or organization a one-star review.  When I do, I try to make sure that I do so dispassionately.  Unfortunately, this is one of those times.

I visited this church a few times, but I found the teaching to be shallow and very much entertainment-oriented.  Entertainment has its place, but it most certainly is not what worship should be about.  The teaching lacked depth, which is what typically happens when the focus is placed on making the church entertaining.

I also visited a couple of their singles groups on several occasions. Not once did anyone in these groups bother to say hello, even when the singles pastor/leader specifically urged everyone to introduce themselves to the newcomers.  I mentioned this to one of their members, and he said, ""Well, you have to understand. The people here want to spend time with their friends.""

As I said, I seldom give one-star ratings, and I do so very reluctantly  In this case though, I honestly can't give them anything higher.",1

4812,"came here many times after we discovered it. I've learnt the trick - arrive around 930-10, you get a nice seat right away, relaxing while you order, fresh food appear on the table as you laugh at the starved suckers that are lining up.

4822,I don't know why this is getting some low reviews. I guess people wanted more acrobatics. I thought it had just enough acrobatics and tons of killer dancing which is what Michael Jackson is known for. Played all the hits. The effects were stunning and spectacular. I don't know more what people want. I thought it was fantastic. I'd definitely see it again or recommend it to anyone. I even had the cheapest seats in the house and it was still great. The view was just fine even in the very back. Great sound. Great show. A+,5
4824,"I was very happy to learn that this store was under new ownership and that the pushy and condescending former owner Rob was no longer there. So I decided to go in and check it out (after vowing never to return after my bad experience with that Rob guy). I'm glad that I did. This store is right on my way home so it is very convenient for me to pop in and get the items I need. I also noticed that their selection of brands have increased and the prices are now competitive with the bigger vitamin stores. Plus all that creepy spiritual/voodoo decor is gone and the store is now bright and clean. The new owner was friendly and went out of his way to help me find the items I wanted (sorry but I didn't get your name but will next time), unlike the former owner who talked down to me and tried to push expensive products at me as if I was an idiot (I do have knowledge of vitamins and supplements). So I can very happily say that this is my new ""go to"" place for all my supplement needs.",5
4825,"Hands down, the best sushi in Pittsburgh, and actually the best sushi I have had period.  TJ, the chef, is amazing and super passionate about the food.  Do yourself a favor and sit at the bar and get the Omakase, where the chef just prepares for you based on whats fresh, you will leave totally stuffed and so satisfied.  Not only is the food amazing, but the people that work there are great and tons of fun. Have a sense of humor and bring yourself plenty of wine and sake to go with your meal.  Don't miss the late night service on Fridays and Saturdays.  I usually eat here at least once a week, sometimes, if Im lucky, two!  Truly a hidden gem in Pittsburgh.",5

4827,"I've never written a Yelp review before but my experience today warranted one. The service at California Pizza Kitchen is some of the best I've ever experienced at a restaurant. The host, my server, and the manager were all very nice and friendly. The host asked if I had ever been in before, which I said I had not. About 10 minutes later after I had ordered the manager came over to introduce himself and welcome me in and brought me a free plate of chips and guacamole! Who does that for a first time visit?! My server Travis always kept my drink fresh without me having to ask and was funny and nice. Even the chef who brought out my food and grated fresh cheese on my pizza was nice! Amazing service here. Will definitely be back.",5

4830,"Five dollars for an entertaining night is usually out of the question, but with AZFunnies I was able enjoy the a great night at a great price. This show was a locomotive train of funny. It kept going and going. The best part, I could leave when I wanted to. The show has an endless supply of comics, so I could walk in at show start and leave a half hour later if I wasn't feeling it. New comics every week, so you know the show will be different. At five dollars, it's worth a shot.",5
4831,"Nate is a genius! Not just with a camera but with people. He knows how to get anyone, even a 17 year old self-conscious girl, to relax so quickly. He did my daughter's senior photos and the pictures are like they are straight out of a magazine. So then I asked him to come and do my Executive team's corporate headshots and they were all really happy with them, which is a major achievement! it's not just the pure quality of the picture but how he can draw out just a great facial expression from his subject. I don't know how he does it, but he is seriously the best photographer I've seen for personal or corporate work.",5
4833,"Omg! How is there more than one of these places? The appetizers were decent, calamari and bruschetta. I ordered wings which I previously believed would be difficult to mess up, boy, was I wrong. They messed up wings, and they messed up wings horribly.  The skin of the wings had a look as though they were just reheated and has sauce thrown on top.  We got the kids pizza, which looked like bread with cheese and ketchup on it, i could do anything to convince my kids to choke that down.

The kids meals usually come with an ice cream, not at Turtle Jacks, you get a rice crispy square.  They charged us an extra $2 for a sundae, granted it was with whipped cream and sprinkles, lol.  i also had the Skor brownie which was not too bad.

The service was nothing great, she was sometimes hard to get, but was always on top of the pop refills.  Friendly, but not overly so.

I went to the restroom, and one stalls door was broken and couldn't lock, and didn't look well maintained.

Unless its a night of just drinks, I think I've had my last visit here.  I feel like this meal is eating me back.",1
4835,I can't understand where these sub-4 star reviews come from but they obviously did not appreciate the beauty of the food served at AL Mike's.

It is a wonderful experience on all levels.,5

No more spiders and sceeters. Absolutely love Zack and we'll keep using his services as long as we live in Vegas!",5
4837,"This was the single WORST experience I have ever had at a medical facility.  On February 21st, My husband and I went there when I broke my foot because there are never any cars in the parking lot and we didn't want to wait in an Urgent Care office or ER at the peak of flu season.  We were ushered right in - no line, no waiting.  I told the male nurse that I had a phobia of getting my blood pressure taken (I have a full blown panic attack) and he had to 'confer' with the physician whether I could be treated or not because of it. He came back and did a pulse-ox and said we didn't have to have a BP.  I waited another 30 minutes for the doc who came in - never even introduced himself, stuck his stethoscope to my thick sweatshirt for ONE second (that was the most ridiculous thing EVER - he didn't hear anything through that shirt in that time and why he needed to do that was beyond me - I had a broken FOOT).  He rudely said, ""Ok, we'll get you an X-ray."" and left.  I waited another 30 minutes - there were NO cars in the parking lot, no one waiting in the waiting room.  I finally peaked my head out and said, ""Do you know when I'll get an X-ray?""  The nurse said, ""Anywhere from one to two hours - our radiologist isn't available right now.""  WHAT???  This is supposed to be an E.R.!  Did he take a lunch break and leave?  I complained that time was excessive due to the fact there was no one there.  The male nurse said, ""Well, if you were at Banner Baywood, you'd be waiting 16 hours.""  I told them I was leaving.  The ONLY service provided by this facility was a PULSE OX.  I do NOT count seeing a doc for ONE SECOND for ONE SECOND of ""PRETEND"" auscultation a 'doctor's visit.'  NO X-RAY was done. I complained in the survey emailed to me and a rep from your organization called me and assured me that the medical director from the facility would be calling me in the next few days. In the MEAN time, I received a bill for $3,165.00 for Emergency Room ($1,839.00) and Radiology ($1,326.00) AND an additional bill for Physician's Services ($330.00).  WHAT??????  These are FRAUDULENT charges.  I want this RESOLVED ASAP.  I have been on hold for over ONE HOUR today trying to call First Choice Emergency Rooms back about this matter.  Most horrible experience ever and you will NOT be paid for this.",1
4838,"Awesome drink specials during happy hour. Fantastic wings that are crispy and delicious, wing night on Tuesday and Thursday!",5
4839,"Spend the extra money and go to a nicer buffet. This is not the epitome of the Vegas buffet. This is more like ""Hometown Buffet"" than a vegas buffet. It was overpriced for the food that was there and we were there on a weeknight and there was a lot of food that was constantly out.",1
4841,"I contacted North Shore customer service to see if the WHY EVO remotes offered on their website are compatible with my garage doors. Customer service told me they were, so I ordered two, only to find out when I tried to program them that they were not compatible. When I finally received a refund, despite showing them the initial correspondence, North Shore only refunded me the price of the remotes, not the full price including shipping. Obviously, had I know the remotes wouldn't work, I wouldn't have ordered them in the first place.",1
4842,I have frequented this nail salon at least 4 times and my last visit will be my last. After the pedicure I had left me with an infection in my toes. At the time of the of the pedicure everything was fine but the next day my toes were literally burning and after spending the night in the emergency room I am definitely unimpressed. I will mention that I normally get a manicure and this was the first time getting a pedicure and that I haven't had any issues with the manicures.,1
4843,"This is such a fun place.  Whether you're hanging out with one friend at the bar or a group of friends at a table - you're going to have a good time.  

Even if you take away the amazing beer - the food is great too.  They have your standard bar food like the 8th Street Ale Chicken Strips (my fav), fish & chips and burgers.  But then there are the Salmon BLT, the Carne Adovada and Chicken Enchiladas - AMAZING!

The icing on the cake is that the staff is great as well.  Always nice and quick to give suggestions.",5
4845,The consistency in the food and drinks are so very appreciated. The service is great and I enjoy my visit each and every time. Had a DJ on a Monday I was there..  Was great music but regardless the playlist was always appropriate. Definitely a place to check out if not for anything but their prohibition drinks,5
4846,"This place is fantastic. Seriously. 
We stopped by here for a nice snack, and we ended up having a darned fine meal. I had a hot sandwich+soup, and my girlfriend had a special chicken salad sandwich. Both were excellent. And keep in mind, I'm not really a 'sandwich guy', but these actually made me want to pick up stuff at the store to make them more often. The soup was awesome- it was a pumpkin soup with small piece of pumpkin in it, delicious, warm, and earthy.
While we were sitting down, one of the people who worked there made it a point to stop by and ask if we needed anything. As it just so happens, we had our eyes on a piece of lemon pie, so we mentioned that to him. He told us that he'd take care of it, vanished, and almost instantly appeared with it back in his hands. I gave him so cash, and he returned just as quickly with a receipt and my change.
A few minutes later, someone else stopped by to check on us. I'll be honest, I was pretty impressed with everyone's friendliness and with the quality of the food. I would never really consider coming to a place like this- like I said, I'm not a 'sandwich guy', but after two visits here making such an impact, I'm thinking that it'll have to become a regular stop. Thanks!!",5
4847,Great service from this company.  We called at 8 am when they opened due to our kid soul car windows being smashed at a la quinta hotel the night before. He  quoted me a little under 500 bucks to replace the back window and drivers rear side window. He said come at 9:30 and we'll be ready for you. We went and he replaced everything within and hour and vacuumed most of the glass out from the vehicle. The price was the same he quoted . Fast and efficient friendly service definitely recommend.,5
4848,"This is a place that truly knows the art of breakfast. Their bacon is hog heaven, their eggs are perfection, their hash browns and home fries are off the charts, and the service is just as good as their bacon. This place is 5+ stars in my books. I wish I took a picture, but my motor skills weren't working fast enough to take the picture, the fork was in my mouth too soon.",5
4850,"My husband and I moved to Monroe a few months ago, we have officially settled in and found our favorite restaurant!!!!  I love the atmosphere you can show up dressed to the nines or in jeans and a tee shirt and feel totally comfortable.  This place is beautiful, clean and huge! The parking lot was completely full we had to park next door but it only took a few minutes to be sat.  Then that's when our dinning experience really began, our server Christina was super friendly and knowledgable she had no problem guiding us through the expansive menu. My husband had the stuffed flounder which was delicious and I had the Spiro chicken that was topped with goat cheese. It was fantastic!!!! We walked (more like waddled we were so full) through the restaurant checking it out, we were impressed! We ventured downstairs to The Oyster Bar that is more laid back we decided to try that next! I hope you do yourself a favor and check this place out! If you get Christina you're in for a real treat but to be honest all the staff was very friendly!",5
4851,"If you are in Vegas just GO HERE. I wish I could give this place more stars! 

Everything about this place was wonderful. The atmosphere is fantastic, the seats are comfortable, the customer service is top notch... and the food literally brought tears to my eyes. We ate until we could eat no more, and both of us had multiple drinks. We walked out for about $65-80 with tip. I fully expected the check to be over $100 and wouldn't have complained it is was. 

My husband and I travel a lot and we don't tend to go to the same place more than once on a trip... but after our first experience here we just had to come back! The 2nd night was just as good as the first. The waitress remembered us and made us feel like regulars - which is rare when you are from out of town. The food and drinks were just as good as the night before, and the owner even came and chatted it up with us for about 10 minutes just because he liked us. 

I have never felt so sad to leave a restaurant. It felt like we were leaving an old friend. I wish I could pick this place up and move it to Seattle. 

Probably the best all around restaurant experience we have ever had.",5
4852,"Super disappointed!  

Burger cold am not as I ordered!!! Spoke to manager she was apologetic but offered no solution. 

The. Neighborhood Wendy's I will not be back and I will
Tell everyone I can they serve bad food!

4853,The team is very friendly and knowledgeable. Front desk is also very nice and welcoming. Office is spotless!!!. Highly recommend this practice.,5
4854,"I have been going here for about a month and I am not satisfied. When I first joined the gym I signed up for a welcome class; the trainer I was suppose to meet with texted me @ 1:30am stating that he was not going to make our meeting @ 9am because he had to do a training. I understand things come up; however I found out when I went in that morning that he was suppose to let me know a week prior when he first found out I was not happy, especially getting that text in the middle of the night when I was asleep. Then I scheduled a time to meet with a different trainer so I can get set up with bi-weekly sit downs for nutrition plans and workout tips. I got the email confirmation and was there for my scheduled time, I showed up and the trainer was not there, they told me to sit down and they'll get a different trainer for me to sit down with. I said I would be on the treadmill waiting if they could come get me when they got someone; I was there an hour and a half and nobody came and talked to me either to reschedule or to have a sit down with someone else. For the icing on the cake I have a 2.5yr old and an 11 month old that go to the gym daycare and I had to call ahead each time to reserve a spot for my infant for both of these meetings that did not happen. I live in North Mesa and would make the 30 minute drive because my toddler enjoyed the childcare area; however within the last week I have been pulled off the floor on 3 separate occasions because my toddler was being picked on and bullied and no adult was by her to stop it so she took matters into her own hands and bit the kids. Nothing was done to the other kids for hitting my kid, my daughter was the only one punished and she was sticking up for herself, because no one was there to say no for her. The kids that keep picking on my daughter are a couple years older than her an know better which is also unsettling. I am not getting what I am paying for and I refuse to EVER bring my kids back. They are the main reason I made the trip to this gym and I have had nothing but terrible experiences with myself and now my kids. I will NEVER bring my kids back here this place is an absolute joke! I would not trust having my kids in the daycare, there are way too many kids and not enough adults.",1
4856,Worse place ever!!!!!!!  With 25 people in the entire place it takes over 45 minutes for our food. They completely forget to make my meal so I get to starve.  The one meal they do decide to make is over cooked and cold.  Never again.  This place sucks!!! Stay away.,1
4858,"4.5 stars!

Went here to celebrate a project with a colleague of mine last night.  Let me tell you  we ate like kings.  We started with the Barrata and Grilled Squid, which were amazing!  the Barrata was served on top of sliced cantaloupe, side of mustard, and bread.  Everything worked well individually but together was magic.  it kind of reminded me of Nonna's (my girlfriend's Nonna but i consider her my own too) house when she served proschiuto with cantaloupe and boconccini....mmmm yummy.  The Grilled Squid was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth.  As our secondi we got Lasagna and i have to be honest Nonna makes the best lasagna hands down but this reminded me of it and if it can do that then i am truly satisfied. It was seasoned and cooked perfectly, no complaints there at all.  As a primi we decided to order the Baseball Cut Steak and Arctic Char.  I preferred the char more because i can get a steak anywhere to be honest.  Now what got me with the char was that it did not remind me of Nonna's but instead my Mommas.  She used to make fish and have this tomato topping just like Seven Numbers.  i was thoroughly impressed with this resto from its decor, staff, and food.   It's definitely a resto i will come to more often because it felt nostalgic eating there and not to mention the girl working there was very knowledgeable and friendly.  I recommend this place to anyone looking to enjoy Italian cuisine if you are either home sick or just want some quality food that reminds you of you family.  Ask them for the chilies in oil if you ever go...amazing!!!",5
4863,"My fiance LOVES Italian food. I had just moved from Louisiana to NC I was tired of eating Olive Garden all the time, so he took me to Frankies. I really love this place! Its a beautiful scenery inside. We go here often but on special occasions. It takes me back, haha.

 I wouldn't recommend a first time visit on Valentines Day.",5
4864,"If I had two more hands I would give it ""Four Thumbs Down""

They should change their name because this is an Embarrassment to a Chicago Classic.

I have been living in Chicago and dining at Giordanos since I was a child.  35+ years later I moved out to Arizona after retiring and to my surprise seen that they had a Giordanos pizza. Needless to say that I had to stop by there withe the family since they had never heard of the place.  THE PIZZA WAS GUMMY ON THE BOTTOM AND LACKED FLAVOR. Ok I said every one makes mistake I had them re-fire it GUMMY THE SECOND TIME TOO. Almost like raw dough. 

I gave them a second try

About a month later I ordered ahead arrived there to have another gummy un cooked pizza. To top it off It didn't taste good AGAIN. I took a frozen heart togo and made it in the oven it was good and the next day the left overs were amazing somehow. 

Last week I went back to Chicago and dined at Giordanos with my family to give them a true experience and we Absolutely loved it. 

I really wish that the owners of the original Giordanos would take a visit to Peoria and see how they are Ruining an amazing creation. I beg that the people highest up on the chain sneak in and try they pizza because it disgusting and making everyone who stood behind Giordanos for year seem like Idiots for praising it so much.  
 The Customer service was awesome the bartender was awesome the restaurant was clean and looked awesome.",1
4865,"Holy smokes.

For starters, I had a tequila and mescal-based berry cocktail that simply blew me away with the unique and interesting flavour fusions. 

As a Canadian, I felt it necessary to sample and judge the poutine. Although by no means a ""traditional"" type of poutine, the dish was amazing. I'm a sucker for duck, so I may be a little biased. Could have used a few more cheese curds.

Atmosphere a little dark and dank for my preferences, but aside from that I have nothing negative to say. Highly recommended.",5
4867,"This is the perfect casual cozy spot!  We went after hiking, sat outside, had the ploughman's platter and a bottle of wine - superb!  The platter had plenty of food for two and was so savory and fresh!  I'm going to have them make some for a cocktail party for me!  Their pizza's are also excellent and creative. NGo!  You'll love it!",5
4868,"Someone messaged me supposedly from the store saying ""We do not well junk that breaks so your review is highly inaccurate and ignorant.""

Absolutely stellar customer service there. 

Their inventory includes cheap junk that breaks easily or is even defective right out of the box. And instead of replacing defective products they try to get you to buy something else. Absolutely ridiculous.",1
4869,"DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY!!!  We have had nothing but bad experiences with them from the day we looked at the house.  It is a very nice place and very new, however, they will lie to your face and do whatever it takes at the time of showing to get you to sign up with them.  There was no stove or fridge when we looked on April 23rd, we were told that they were being ordered and would be in the residence by the time it is ready for renting.  Also, we told Tommy (Thomas DiMaggio) that we had two dogs and we asked what was needed for extra deposit.  His only answer was that it would be a $150/dog DEPOSIT up front and that was it.  We talked about other companies tacking on fees for any little thing and Tommy insisted that this company doesn't do that...HA!!!  Once we were accepted we were given a laundry list of added fees, including an additional fee each month for the pets.  I inquired about this and was given the runaround about how it is on all of their postings.  So I looked and couldn't find a single one with it listed, then their story changed to it is on the lease, well we hadn't been given a lease at this point yet, so yet again, their story changed to it is stated on the application online.  In any case, their pet ""deposit"" also is not such, it is an additional FEE which is NOT returned at any time.  I called several times over the course of the next couple weeks and every time I only got messages and no one ever returned them.  It came to our move-in date and I showed up when the office opened to drop off our check and pick up our keys just to be told that we need to have scheduled an appointment for their move in process.  Of course the supervisor at this office, Heather, does absolutely nothing but apologize profusely but will give nothing for assurances that things will be any different.  So we get to the house and SURPRISE, there are no new appliances.  I am told by Tommy that I will be getting a call to set up the delivery.  Well I did and Sears was to deliver stove and fridge the following day.  I sat at the empty house for three hours when I finally called Sears to see if their team had been running behind, just to find out that the delivery had been cancelled.  I was out of town for the next couple of days and I contacted their corporate office.  About the only thing better is that they answer the phone when it rings.  Other than that, they do nothing more and the second time I called corporate actually started getting scolded because it was my fault for not giving the local time enough time to resolve this matter.  WOW, from the 23rd - the 15th of the following month isn't enough time to get appliances in place.  There are many other issues with this company but that is the biggest... so far.  We have yet to have any type of positive experience and we still haven't moved in yet.",1
4870,This was our favorite meal together yet. We came tonight to celebrate our anniversary and were completely spoiled by the staff! We were provided a personalized menu with our names on it and one signed by the chef! Our server Frenchie (Patrick) did an amazing job explaining the food options and ensuring we had the best possible experience. Our favorites were the shrimp and grits and the steak. We love the creativity of the menu and the fact that everything is local to NC. The drinks are amazing as well. We decided to try the I Trust You and both loved the drinks the bartender concocted. Towards the end of our meal we were even provided champagne (and two take home cookies!) to top off the celebration! Will definitely return.,5
4871,"Paid for a wash and wax job on my vehicle and received the car with trash, dirt and crumbs still on the seats and on the floors. The floor mats weren't even in there back the way they were supposed to be. They sprayed armor all directly into the speaker so it dripped out of it when we opened the door. The vacuum job was a joke and they said ""they don't clean the inside"" and the dog hair would be too difficult to remove which is understandable but leaving behind the basics is unacceptable. I do not recommend this car wash if you want to have your car washed. They clearly over charge for a half job.",1

Got the pot roast fries.  The gravy was dark dark brown, all salt, and gelatinous.  Disgusting.  The onion frazzles on top were cold and soggy.

4885,"As mentioned, Abe is no longer there...and that's too bad.  I will never take my shoes here again.  They are disorganized and have very poor customer service.  Here is what happened:

I took three pairs of shoes in for repairs.  I went back two weeks later, after they said the shoes would be ready.  I picked up two pairs.  I had to wait about 15 minutes for the second pair because they did not shine them like they were suppose to.  Furthermore, they could not find my third pair of shoes.  The guy who runs the place now (a short middle aged hispanic man)  told me he would look for it and get back to me.  He said he had to speak with the person who took my shoes in when I first brought them.  

A week passed and he did not call me when he said he would.  I called them.  They still had not located my shoes.  Again, the guy who runs the place told me he would look for them and give me a call back.  

Another week passed and again, I never got a call.  So, again, I called them.  Still no shoes.  I told him that he needed to do something about the fact that they could not find my shoes.  That I was tired of waiting. Four weeks had passed since I had dropped off my shoes.  He asked how much my shoes were, if I had a receipt, and what brand.  I told him that I didn't have a receipt and that I did not know the brand.  Who still has a receipt for a pair of shoes they bought a year ago?  And I don't pay attention to name brands.  I just buy what I like.  However I did know that I paid about $100 for the shoes.  After I told him this, again, he said he would call me back in a couple of days. 

Again, he never called me and I had to call him.  He told me he would only compensate me $30 for the pair of shoes that they lost, citing some ""law"" stating that without a receipt he only had to compensate customers for 25-50% of the cost of the shoes.  I asked him what ""law"" he was speaking of and he didn't say.  I told him I would speak to an attorney to get some information about my rights and that I would get back to him.  BTW:  If you are an ASU student, you can get free legal advice.  

About 10 minutes after that last conversation, I get a call from the same guy I had been speaking with the whole time, and guess what?  They found my shoes.  I went to pick them up the same day.  

I was happy they found my shoes.  However, I was also upset at the way they handled the whole situation.  The guy who runs this place now never called me when he said he would, kept telling me he would look for my shoes, only offered me $30 as compensation, never apologized or felt bad for loosing/misplacing my shoes and putting me through what he did, and I did not get my shoes back till more than a month later after threatening legal action. 

I would not recommend this business to anyone.",1

Once inside it took about a minute or so before anyone even looked up to acknowledge us. Eventually a gentleman manning the grill told us someone would be with us shortly. After about 2 or so minutes a young lady came to take our order. We were ordering 3 items but I guess since she only saw two of us she assumed we were only ordering two items? My husband had to reiterate that we had a third item to make. She basically ignored us and proceeded with only the two items. We figured maybe since she started the two she was going to finish with those and make the third, which didn't make sense. I have to say that on first impression of her there was no ""hello"", no smile. The first thing she said was, ""what did you want to order?"" She seemed to be either in a really bad mood or she hates her job. The final straw was while she was trying to roll the burrito a good amount of the filling was bursting out onto the foil. What did she do after that? She kept wrapping the burrito into the wet mess. We are supposed to eat that with our hands? We felt frustrated with how we were being treated and it seemed our money/order didn't matter, so we left. I have NEVER done that before but that was simple unacceptable. HORRIBLE, horrible service!",1

I've been battling my weight most of my life, and I've never had good luck keeping a fitness routine.

However, something about Planet Fitness has helped me keep my fitness goals. 
Sure, their personal trainers have been running through a revolving door, and most of them are promoted desk jockeys, but I don't really use their service or take their ""classes"" 
The have TONS of cardio equipment, and just enough weights that there is no, or very little wait. People are polite, and the facility is CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN. 

I was visiting some other gyms because I was interested in classes, but nothing came close to Planet Fitness. I've been visiting nearly daily for eight months and I love it.

4900,"I would NOT recommend this dog care facility to anyone!! I went into their Ajax location on Kingston Road two weeks prior to book my puppy ""Koda"" in for an overnight boarding, I had an out-of-town wedding to attend.  They marked Koda on the calendar for a one night overstay, and informed me I would need a Bordetella vacine, which I had done.  I called them a week prior to confirm Koda was signed up for sure, and they said yes, and I asked them if they could send me the paperwork to fill out to save us time on the Saturday when we drop off our puppy. The girl said we could come in anytime to fill our the papers, so we did on the Tuesday night at 4pm, and to our surprise, there were two girls there, one gave us the sheet to fill out and the other girl said ""oh no I won't be here for one dog, I have the weekend off"",  she then called over to their other location on Finley and got the owner on the phone to talk to me, and she informed me because there was only one dog ""Koda"", booked it was not worth paying a staff  member so she gave her the weekend off, but..... I could bring Koda to her Finley location and he would be all by himself with no one there, but she could monitor him by camera from her house can you imagine? not acceptable!!! so I was out on a limb, if I had of brought Koda there on the Saturday  morning the place would have been locked up.

I look forward to my visits with her, not just because I know I'll start physically feeling better, but because she is such a pleasant person :). She is also really great at working with you on appointment times. I can't always make it before the end of office hours so her and her staff are great at working with me to find a time that works. WONDERFUL Doctor and WONDERFUL staff. Always leaving with a smile!",5
4905,"Was staying at the Rio Hotel and needed a rent car to go see Hoover Dam and Mt. Charleston.

Reserved that morning and was picked up at the Rio about 45 minutes later. Always appreciate the fact Enterprise will pick you up and drop you off if needed.

Car worked out great, no issues.

Real reason I'm doing this review is because of the excellent customer service provided by Carly and, I believe, Brian. Easy check in and return, basically a painless process.",5
4910,"I must be in the wrong business. 2 hours of waiting....its a $223 battery. So far I have had break issues, wiper blade issues and now a new battery all things not covered by my warranty and had the vehicle for a year. Wow...what a deal! Still never figured out what causes overheating after 2 trips here.  Other than the H3 Alphas weren't made to idle on a hot day for more than 20 minutes. GMPP and GM Major Guard has saved me what? Guess those free oil changes I paid for have been handy. Glad to a have dealer so close to the house but only good if I can get good service.",1
4912,Edgar was out to our house in less than 30 mins after talking with him over the phone. We needed to have our water heater drained and removed so the walls could dry. It was about 7pm if not later on a Sunday evening. He did an excellent job and was thorough. We are looking forward to having him come in a few days to install the new water heater.,5
4913,"Great food, great service, and unique feel with onsite butcher shop. If you drink wine - no corkage fee!  Huge plus with total wine down the street. Get balcony seating if possible, it's over the fountain and makes for a great setting.  Highly recommend especially for bachelor party or going out in groups.  It has an open concept for most tables,  which I like (but my parents did not).",5

4922,"Excellent the food was amazing. Boris was a excellent server. We started out with Sasha the manager he was good too.  We were the only ones in the dining room but they made sure to stop by often to see if we needed anything. I had the Calamari Fritti and Salad "" Va Bene"". My husband had the Linguine Frutti di Mare.  It was a wonderful place to celebrate our 36 wedding anniversary.",5

4924,"They took such great care of my grandpa who came in for heart surgery, had a stroke on the table at Banner Heart and was in bad shape in ICU for a while, then moved into rehab at Baywood. Every single person who took care of him was fantastic to him and everyone in the family. We had relatives flying in and out from states to come visit while in ICU and they let everyone in to see him as long as we wanted, got to help with his care and stay with him. I never was treated bad once by any doctor or nurse and they all had amazing bedside manner, I wish every hospital had employees like them and every patient could experience what he did with the staff. He constantly said throughout his stay that every single one of them were angels. I believe it too. Male or female nurses and CNAs, information staff, cafeteria workers, doctors, everyone was just amazing! Always cheery, loved to have conversations (my grandpa's a real talker and loves telling stories) and they always listened and were happy to chat with him and us. It was like getting to know them personally for as long as he was here at these two hospitals. Five stars for Banner Heart and Banner Baywood!

Also, I had testing done at Banner Heart too, and the staff, they were just as great to me. You can't ask for a better place to go for care of the technology they have to diagnose you and the people to watch over for you. I'm also happy to have Rodrigo Chan as my doctor. He's a great guy, great personality and bedside manner. 

These two hospitals are a great environment for everyone. Cafeteria is unique and has some good food. I would say the only problem is parking. It is crowded for both and most times you're going to have to park in the complex garage.

I would recommend both of these hospitals to anyone looking for somewhere to go for their treatment!",5

4928,"Our housing company sent this company over to furnace clean.  Unfortunately, we know how our furnace should be cleaned since my ex-husband is in the business.  The loan operator of the truck started by hooking up the large hose to the bottom of the furnace to suck from both hot and cold air returns.  These need to be done separately!  He did not cover any of the vents.  This helps with sucking the dust out of the vents, and instead blew the dust into the basement suite. He blew out all the vents that were uncovered, and finished by doing the main run.  My son put his hand on the register and told me there was no pressure, so where is the dust going to move?  It took him 50 min. To do a two story, which takes my boys two hours to do the same job.  I am still dry mopping dust off the floors, and can see more dust particles floating in the air.  The air quality is now worse then ever, and thanks to this company I have more house cleaning.  Spend your money elsewhere folks with a reputable company.",1
4931,"I won't be coming back. Waited like 20 minutes craving a burger. No signs saying I can't get lunch. Then I get told at 1040 I'd have to wait 20 minutes to get a burger. There was no line, not that hard to make a burger. I probably won't be coming again. Food is great, always long lines wish they could have just made me a burger a little early and I'd be a customer for life. Or at least have a sign on lunch saying 11 on........ seriously didn't have time today waited in line cause I was craving burger could have gotten a breakfast burrito anyway way to lose a customer",1
4932,"DELICIOUS. We ordered a beef and chicken shawarma. Both were filled with fresh meat and vegetables and were moist and scrumptious. Watch out for the hot and spicy version -- it's seriously HOT and SPICY. The shawarma looked a little small as we watched them being prepared -- but they fill you up without making you feel like the Goodyear blimp. A couple at one of the tables each had a shawarma plate which was loaded with chicken, rice and salad. We plan to try that next time. Parking is definitely an issue -- but when you want an awesome shawarma, this definitely gets two thumbs up and is definitely on our favourites list!",5

4934,"Homelife Protection isn't a good warranty company at all. I filed two claims with in one week.  The first was the hose bibs to my washer, they were leaking.  After telling the rep that the hose bibs are leaking cause of corrosion they still send a plumber out (which is owned by Homelife)  he took apart the hoses and called in the Melissa (the lady that denies claims)and they said they won't cover the claim because of corrosion. The plumber left all the parts out and our water off at left when I told him the $240 price was too much money for this repair.  I went to home depot bought the part and plumbers tape for $3.81.  With a wrench and elbow grease I fixed it. Two days later on Labor Day out AC went out when it was 109 degrees.  We called 3 times on Saturday and didn't get a call back.  On Sunday we call the property damage line and got someone on the phone. They wanted $150 because it was a Sunday, I told the customer service rep on the phone this policy is garbage and he said He doesn't want to be verbally abused. On Tuesday the tech came out and said they don't cover control boards.  He wanted $290 for this repair.  We are trying to cancel or coverage currently and I am hoping for a smooth process, however, I can't be optimistic. In the fine print of the policy they mention not refunding money if the customer is verbally abusive.  I am sure the guy noted I said the policy was garbage.",1
4936,"The care our pets have received at Aloha has been simply beyond outstanding. I cannot say enough good things about the people who work here - with every visit I've felt confident that they truly care about my animal family and that the medical attention will be the finest available. I know this sounds over the top, but Aloha really is just that good.

Both of the Drs. Sulliban have treated our Russian dwarf hamsters on several occasions. It's not that we haven't had good veterinary care for our hammies before, but in those cases was more a matter of luck that the vet was willing to get up to speed on hamster surgery. At Aloha, they specialize in (among other things) exotics, and it really, really shows. 

From the warm-hearted women in reception who coo at length over your pet, to the assistants who ask all of the right, detailed questions as they enter the data into the computer and take a photo of your pet for the file (and for the reminder postcards they will send when it's time for a checkup), to Dr. Jason who takes his time explaining every symptom, cause, and possibility and answering even the most far-out questions, I just cannot be more impressed. (And let's not forget the follow-up call a few days later, just to be sure that all is well.)

The facilities are outstanding. We went to their open house a couple of years ago and were amazed. The boarding areas are thoughtfully designed (and yes, they do board hamsters and other critters!), the equipment seems to be high tech, and it's obvious that the layout was carefully planned from the start to have everything they need just as it should be. 

The design of the exam rooms and waiting area is comfortable and welcoming. (Hawaiian candy bars while you wait!) I am always touched by the things people have made in appreciation that hang artfully on the walls. The surroundings speak of integrity and reassurance.

I also appreciate that Aloha is active in the community, such as conducting rabbit education programs for the SPCA, advertising local pet-friendly events, etc.

Nobody likes to think about money when their companion is ill. I tend to be the type who just wants my little friend to be well and happy again, even if it means handing over the Visa card with my eyes closed. Aloha has never put my vulnerability to the test, though. Exam fees and medicines are always reasonable, and the receipt is itemized very nicely. (Oh, and look, there's your pet's photo at the top. Aww.)

I can't imagine a better option for animal care in Las Vegas. If Facebook had a game called ""VeterinarianVille,"" this would be the animal hospital all of the top players would try to create. I'm trying to think how far away I'd have to move to switch to someone else... Baker? No, it would still be worth the trip. Barstow? Nope, still coming back to Aloha. San Diego? Maybe, but only because the hammies might get carsick, or they might get stressed when I yell at other freeway drivers. (Although I like to think that hamsters are with me on my ""indicators exist for a reason, bucko!"" crusade.)

Thank you, Aloha, for exceptional care and peace of mind. You are the best.",5
4937,"awesome addition to the downtown area... well needed convenience!!!

We were so excited to try these donuts so we showed up at 7 am on Sunday morning because when we called the day before the employee told us that we could preorder and pick up at 7 am.  However, we decided to just to go right when they open.  So once we got there we were greeted rudely by the manager telling us we weren't allowed in to buy any donuts since they don't open until 8 am.  We then decided to call to make an order on the phone which the employee told us that we could pick it up right away even though they haven't opened.  So we decided to place the order and were so excited waiting outside for our donuts: however, we waited for 40 mins and no one came out.  We decided to give them a call back and the employee stated that the manager wouldn't allow him to sell us the donuts at that point we were fed up and decided to leave because they were rude and unprofessional.  They should have given us a call back instead of making us wait for 40 mins.  Now I will never go back to an establishment that has bad customer service even if they are rated highly.",1

The BLT was piled high with crispy bacon and the burgers were moist, cooked to order and yummy.

4950,"Wow is an understatement! It has been several years since I've eaten at Va Bene Italian Restaurant. Celebrating my birthday with my husband and son on Dec. 19 was a special dining experience. I have no idea what they do to their Calamari Rings, but this was an appetizer extraordinaire. There was a special sauce that was extremely tasty, but the rings themselves were prepared in a way to make them very soft. I have eaten this appetizer at many different restaurants, but this is hands down the best. They kept bringing a basket of sliced bread with a orange-colored butter that was exquisite to the tongue. Then the main course of a chicken with fettucine was very well prepared. The healthy portion allowed me to take some home and much to my surprise heated up well two days later. The Server and Manager were very attentive also. I have no qualms about recommending Va Bene in Ahwatukee for a fine dining experience.",5
4952,"I'm shocking myself by giving this place a good review.  I do like Taco Bell, even sometimes when sober.  I guess I appreciate the fact that I've never found anything disgusting in my food, and they always have those green salsa packets in stock.  Service is usually quick or I'm too wasted to remember how long it took.  The taco artists are nice too.  Props for not ever giving me the 'rheas for longer than 24 hours, thanks guys!

Edit.....  Uhhh, what the hell guys?!?  I order 2 food items, both with NO MEAT.  I get home, hungry, at 2am, and gleefully open my food items.  One of them is as ordered, but the other is slathered in GREASY GOD DAMN STEAMING MYSTERY MEAT.  Thanks for nothing, jerks!",1
4953,"The seating area is more like a cafe and it didn't have the restaurant vibe I was expecting but the DELICIOUS FOOD and FRIENDLY OWNERS more than made up for it.  Seriously the food is so good is unreal!  I can see this place expanding as the they busier.  Also, no liquor license yet but it's coming. Still 5 stars for the food and service.",5
4954,"It's a Wednesday night and I didn't feel like cooking. What's a hungry guy suppose to do? You guessed it... Go out! I check around to see who's available for some good cheap  eats. A friend of mine gets back to me saying she received a free birthday burger email from Red Robin's. Why not I say. I don't mind being the buy one (thats me) get one free (thats her) person in this deal.

We get there around 7:30. The place is huge. Busy? It was normal I guess for a Wednesday night. Workers? Tons. 

""Table for two please"" I tell the young male host. ""Just a moment"" he replies. He then goes around the half empty restaurant talking to the different servers. He comes back and says ""Please have a seat in the waiting area. I will seat you when the next table is available.""

I might of been a little tipsy from drinking before hand... But seriously... ""When the next table is available?"" I might not have the powers like Haley Joel Osment, from Sixth Sense, to see people in the empty tables, but what I can see is about 30 tables which I could be sitting at. So we do what we can do... Wait.

About 5 minutes later, we ask the host if we can sit in that empty table next to the nice people who seem to be enjoying their meal. ""I'll have to check with the server of that area"" says the host.

About 8 minutes later... The manager comes out and asks us if we have been helped... Since we're the only people waiting for a table, I assume he's talking to us. ""Yes sir. We're waiting for a table. Apparently its standing room only in here tonight."" I smirked. ""Come with me"", he says. 

We walk across the restaurant and he seats us in a booth. Sweet. We go to the only table in the restaurant where the lamp over the table is out. ""I dont mind the mood lighting... But can we sit someplace where I can see my friends face?"" I requested. I know... I know... I'm just asking for something to ""happen"" to my food but i'm pretty much past that point.

The nice waitress moves us over a few tables and everything seems to be at peace in the universe now. We crack open the menu's and decided on two good looking burgers. Our order goes in... And we wait.... And wait... And wait...

The family next to us, who appeared to be waiting for a long long time, finally tires of the wait and gets up to leave. The manager quickly catches them and asks if he could do anything for them. The father explains that they have been waiting for like 30 mins for their food and their kids are hungry and they are leaving to get food. The manager offers to pick up their tab if they agree to sit and eat. The family leaves. Great... I'm stoked.

Eventually... Our food comes out. After a careful inspection, we eat. We pay. We leave. 

Oh and my burger was alright. I got the A1 Peppercorn burger. The description says ""Sizzling, hickory-smoked bacon, melted Pepper-Jack cheese, A.1.¬Æ peppercorn spread, crispy onion straws, onions and tomatoes on an onion bun. It's a taste explosion!""

I was upset that I couldnt give this place ZERO stars but I guess the burger was good enough for me to give them one star. I also thought it was cool that if you sign up on their website they send you a free burger coupon on your birthday. FYI, I read somewhere that the Peppercorn burger is one of the unhealthiest ones you can order there. Great. It just keeps getting better!

To see the yummy burger, check out the pics!",1
4957,"Worst experience ever. I have seen the unit through automatic way, I liked it then I wanted to put an application, however there were no online application, so I tried to reach the property manager. I have sent e-mail, text message and called three times and left message within 5 days. Never returned my calls or e-mails. Today I have called her again and asked to see if she listened my voice messages to save some time, she replied basically ""no"" 

When I say that I want to fill an application for the unit, she said someone else sent an application last night and she said they look good and probably they will be approved.

That shouldn't happen but people may miss e-mails, text messages and 3 voice messages, I would understand that. The problem is I haven't heard ""I'm sorry"" in anywhere in the conversation. She was so unhelpful and rude. I would stay out of this company for all cost. I wouldn't go in that unit even if they offer it for free now.

4959,"If I could give them negative stars I certainly would!  I was so excited to sign up for a healthy- food delivery service for my family's busy weekdays but I haven't even received my first delivery yet and I'm already disappointed!

After seeing their ad on Facebook, I went to their website and everything looked amazing so I proceeded to sign up.  The default delivery date showed this Friday and I discovered I was unable to change the delivery date to next week (as I know I will be out of town this weekend for Easter).  On this same screen it states, ""You can change the day later,""  so I went on through the purchasing process.  I selected the $129 plan for 12 meals a week which I felt was worth it considering the time I would save during the week.  After completing my order I could not find anywhere that would let me change the date.  I searched all over the site and the Help section with no luck so I emailed customer service with my concerns immediately after placing the order.

Their reply was absolutely shocking.  Shocking because it's 2016 and Customer Service is key to the success of any business and Freshly could care less if they address my issue.  They basically told me that the order was already processed and suggested that I donate the food or give it to a friend if I don't want it.  I never said I did not want the delivery, it just needs to come next week because I will be out of town Fri-Sun so no one would be there to receive the order.  

I cannot wrap my mind around how they believe this is an acceptable reply to my email.  I'm a brand new customer that expressed my concerns about the delivery date 4 days prior to delivery and literally as soon as I placed the order.",1
4961,"This is usually one of my go-to spots when I come out to Arizona to see my dad but today's visit will have me looking for a new one.  Everything was going fine until I got to the filming brush all of a sudden the foamy soap starts squirting out from the top of the hose that swivels above you.  I still had about three minutes and 50 seconds left but I still went to look for the guy I needed to scrub my car. He was in the middle of prescribing a car for one of those people that just pull up and want someone to do it for you I don't quite understand them why go to a coin operated car wash but that's another story.  Anyway he comes over apologizes has me go to another stall even hooked it up now I have over 10 minutes.

So there I am scrubbing my car scrubbing scrubbing scrubbing I do the rinse off then I switch it to the wax all the sudden guess what doesn't want to come out wax!  I kind of glanced around to see if I saw him I was like forget it its Phoenix it's freaking hot I'm going to rinse my car off I'm cool.

So now I'm drying my car and I decide quick I put my four quarters in and a vacuum had no suction whatsoever.

So for me personally three issues on one visit yeah I'll be looking for another one",1
4962,"Had dinner with a friend tonight, we ordered the sea bass and the salmon. The fish was well done and very tasty, good quality fish. Everything else on the plate was awful. The sea bass came with an extra large portion of lukewarm frozen corn mixes with undercooked peas and diced peppers. For $25 dollars I'm extremely disappointed as I would have expected fresh vegetables and something other than just vegetables... My friend had the salmon, it came with a side of overlooked rice that tasted as if it was Uncle Bens ready made. The salmon also came with a few pieces of canned pickled artichoke. Again, for $25 dollars this is a joke. We will not be returning.",1

We just moved in and are new to the USA from Canada. 9 days in to owning our home and we walked out the door to walk our dogs and BOOM! - the garage door springs snapped. We have never owned a garage and had zero idea who to call or how to fix it. 
We got Jeff's name from Yelp - and thought, hey it's Sunday we could leave a message and maybe get it fixed this week. 

He actually answered the phone, and said he would be over by 12 noon. We thought... of which day?! I am still in shock that he came over at 12 on a Sunday and within 2 hours had our springs fixed, added a spring, installed a new track, motor, keypad - all the bells and whistles for an incredible price! Now, we aren't experts on price, but compared to what I read elsewhere and what I've heard from friends - we were quite pleased with Jeff's work, professionalism and cost. 
We're definitely having him back to do our door insulation :)

4986,"I love monkeys and had always wanted to try this place.  I've stopped in a few times, but the $12-15 per cocktail led me on down the road.  Before our last trip to Vegas I found a Travelzoo deal for $29 for four ($12) cocktails, making them just about $7.50 each, so I jumped on it.  We came about 8pm on a Tuesday night and there were several people in the place.  Service was quick and I asked if I could order a $15 Monkey Suit drink and pay the difference.  No...you don't have to pay any difference, I'll include it with the coupon!  Yes!  We ordered two of those and then followed up with a a Margarita and a cucumber drink (don't remember the name, but it was very good).  When we went to check out, I expected to pay taxes but the server told us were were good.  She was awesome and got a nice tip.  I'd visit again, but damn, that Monkey Suit was strong.   I was buzzed for awhile on just that drink.",5
4990,"A new low, even by airport standards.  The ""double"" drinks were still pretty weak (seemed like I was just drinking a $12 single), and the pizza was the absolute worst one I've ever had.  Wouldn't be surprised to find they were frozen ones being microwaved in the next room.  I ordered the prosciutto and arugula one.  It ended up being a flat tasteless (frozen looking) cheese pizza with a pile of ""toppings"" thrown on top on the middle. Not cooked onto the pizza -- cold on top.  The prosciutto tasted like it had gone bad, so I ended up just pushing it off the piece I ate.  

Service was really poor, too.  I was sitting at the bar, and it took over 10 minutes to get the bartender to take my drink order.  He waited on literally everyone else who arrived after me, while avoiding making eye contact.  Finally, he acknowledged me by saying ""did you need something?""  Do people often sit down at the bar if they don't want a drink?

$40 for pizza and two drinks.  Never again.",1

4999,"Just happened by this place as we were walking around. My wife suggested I get a flat hat. They staff was super friendly and helpful. I ended up getting a hat with a lifetime warranty to boot. They also provide a military discount which is always appreciated. Later in the evening I felt the hat was a little too tight, we stopped back in and they stretched it for free. This was a nice find with friendly staff and great products.",5
5000,"HORRIBLE! Do not waste your time. They nickle you to death with extra fees, $15 EACH Person, and EACH Vehicle and EACH Dog these prices are not listed anywhere, and it's noisy as hell. The park has so many long term people that pretty much do what they want, always loud at 10 & 11 pm at night. Clean bathrooms is about it here.",1
5001,"I am trying to get better about writing reviews. Especially for local shop owners who deserve good reviews. I found Bike Doctor on Yelp. I went to his site and requested for a tune up. I thought this would be perfect since I have a bad back an a heavy Electra beach cruiser and to lift and put into my car would of been bad. Chris was very responsive, he asked a few questions about my bike what kind and what I needed. We set a day and time and no longer than maybe 30 mins. My bike was in perfect shape. This was so great! I paid $45 and well threw in $5 bc of he worked in the heat. But last year I paid Sun Cyclery over $100 for a tune up and I feel like I got sucked into buying new tires and tire tubes...plus I had to wait a few days to get my bike back. This was so convenient and easy...it was great! Thanks Chris.",5
5003,POOR SERVICE today. It took 50 minutes to get our food! The manager took $9.00 off our bill. She was nice but should have comped the entire meal! Gloria was our server & had a PATHETIC ATTITUDE!!!  We will never go back!!,1
5004,"It's rare nowadays to receive excellent customer service as I did at the Phoenix Lucille's ,the young lady Savnnah did an amazing job on serving her customer she was prompt and polite!! 

If you want great service in a good environment please ask for Savannah!",5
5007,"Delicious food and great ambience!

We were on a road trip heading south looking for lunch close to the 15 freeway.  Thanks, Yelp, for bringing us here!  We were pleased right off the bat with the warm tortilla chips, hot bean dip, and salsa as soon as we sat down.  We're suckers for tableside guacamole, which was great as well.  The portions were huge - we only needed two entrees to feed me, my wife, and our two kids.  We got the fish tacos and the combination with a chili relleno and green chile pork burrito.  My only criticism of the food is that the peppers they used for the relleno were VERY mild and I like them to have a bit more punch.

The kids enjoyed the live mariachi and had fun watching them make the tortillas fresh behind a window in the corner of the restaurant.  All in all a pleasant meal and we were back on the freeway quickly.",5
5010,Not the greatest. Meat and rice were good. Salad was super soggy. Bread they throw in there was not soft or fresh. For the price it's not worth it. I should've known from the guys annoyed tone on the phone when I was placing my order that they don't care too much about their customers or even care to have customers. I won't be back.,1
5012,"Our first visit was because our dog was sick , their outsanding service started as soon as I dialed there number, they took me step by step and even offered a discount . There staff is pleasant and inviting . We love it here ..wouldn't change them for anything it's worth the 30 min drive",5
5015,This my new favorite brunch or lunch spot! The hand pies are so yummy and such good quality ingredients! They have a great selection of sweet and savory offerings with interesting ingredient parings. Small and off the beaten path but totally worth it!,5
5017,"Best salon I've ever been to! Serene, peaceful, beautifully decorated, fantastic customer service, excellent services provided and very helpful!",5
5019,Used to love Noodles and Company but this location continues to underwhelm.  Burnt Parmesan chicken and terrible noodles.  They've become an overpriced McDonalds with the low quality food.,1
5020,I been a cancer patient for 5 years I started out going to Umc when they use to have a cancer center there needless to say Umc cancer center closed down for a reason they were horrible but I got switched to a new center and a new dr at this place. I have to say I get much better medical treatment here and my dr .. dr Kingsley is great so if your in need of a good oncologist I highly recommend this center,5
5022,"This place is great.  We've been here several times and always leave pleased.  I suggest making your own burger or the ""meat your maker"".  I usually do the bison meat but the wagyu is great too.  The fries with toppings are awesome.  Appetizers are huge and equally good.  We did find the chicken burger a bit of a let down but hey its a burger place.  

Our favorite milkshake is the carmel pretzel but on one or two occasions its been way too salty.  We asked and they happily replaced it.  The other milkshakes are great too and they can add liquor to any shake. Great beer list too (not huge but quality craft beers).  

One piece of advice is go early and/or with time flexibility.  They'll text you ten minutes before the table is ready so we usually go back home or do some shopping/people watching at Walmart.",5
5023,"Good service (Rob). You choice what do you want eat. They have a salad and beefs bar for choice and in minutes the good ""cocineros"" lo hacen para usted! Muchas salsas para escoger!",5
5025,Rachel is amazing! I came in with significant sciatica/piriformis pain. She took one look and said the same thing a prior physical therapist had honed in on - that my left hip was higher than the right. She spent a solid hour working my left side. I left feeling better and immediately booked a follow-up appointment. You won't regret coming to see Rachel!,5
5026,The collards were so salty i had to throw them away. the mac n cheese was mush n cheese. the brisket tough tough tough. the peach cobbler was the only thing good. the rest was trash. i was very disappointed because this food used to be good.,1
5027,"Scarpetta has amazing food and is in a great location with nice views. 

The yellowtail and polenta appetizers were both delicious with the yellowtail being slightly better.

The short rib agnolloti and the duck and foie gras ravioli were two amazing pastas that are very unique to the restaurant.

The entrees did not live up to the first two courses but the baby goat was satisfying. I wouldn't recommend the halibut.

The head chef Scott Conant was in the restaurant which is very rare for Vegas. When you head to this restaurant stick mostly with the pastas and appetizers and you will have a unique and enjoyable dining experience.",5
5029,"There are so many new and exciting restaurants coming to Gilbert and Zinburger is just one of them.  For so long, there was a limited amount of restaurants in this downtown area and now, there are a bunch to choose from.  

Zinburger is a lovely decorated restaurant with a shabby chic feel.  It is an open air concept with a nice outdoor patio and a large dining room that has windows that can completely open to the outside for that open air feel so even if you aren't outside, you feel as though you are.  The bar is nice and large and I can see coming here to spend time at the bar as well.  

The burgers here are what I would call a gourmet burger without being stuffy.  I am really picky about my burgers but these are really good.  The taste is just right and there isn't any gristle.  The fries are hand cut and tasty as well and can be shared.  The only thing I thought it lacked was a little presentation.  The burger was literally on the plate with nothing else.  It looked lonely.

Service was very good and we were able to spend some time without feeling like we were being rushed.  I will definitely be back to Zinburger.  It is a nice place to meet up with friends!",5
5030,This place is my new chicken favorite!  It is absolutely the best chicken I have ever eaten. It is fresh. Tender. Flavorful. I love it.,5
5031,"Tried to buy movie tickets online and was told ""movie tickets were not available at this time"". I called to ask if our movie was sold out and if we could pick another time so we wouldn't have to drive all the way out to Scottsdale if it was unavailable and was transferred to an assistant who told me to call again later.",1
5032,"One of the best spots for southern food in Charlotte. We got mac n cheese, chicken fingers, biscuits, and hush puppies. It is one of our favorite places in the city. The drinks are average, but all of the food has been great. Definitely worth checking out.",5
5034,"I couldn't have asked for a better ""car buying experience"" I started car shopping a few months ago and initially looked at a rogue. After I test drove one I decided it just wasn't right for me. What I loved was that the salesman I worked with (Cj) didn't pressure me into buying something I didn't want. I mentioned to him what I was looking for and he showed me a couple different options. I did mention that I was looking for a smaller sized crossover. Instead of selling me on the Nissan he showed me a couple pre owned options (I was open to new cars or a pre owned with low miles) they had on the lot. I ended up going with a terrain they had there and I absolutely LOVE my new car. Honestly I really can't say enough about how smoothly the whole deal went!!!",5
5035,"THINK TWICE!! And yes I had an appointment !!What was suppose to be a quick oil change & tire rotation turned into
A 3.5 hour ordeal. 1...45 min. Before they pulled my truck in 2...they couldn't get the lug nuts off my wheels because they were ""messed"" up ( i watched the ""tech"" use the wrong socket to start with) 3... I ask for them to replace the drain plug. The old one was leaking. When I got home I saw an oil leak!  I took my truck back to them immediately. Drain plug had not been replaced and was loose. I took it out using my fingers!!",1
5036,"If I could give them 0 stars, I would. You pay a mandatory resort fee of $15 a night that supposedly goes to pool, internet access, parking, fitness center. Their pool is closed until April (not like I would use their dirty pool anyway), parking is impossible to find,  the internet is spotty. Now I have to visit the nasty fitness center to get my $15 worth of this stupid resort fee. I just hope I don't contract anything from the machines. Look, I don't mind paying a resort fee if I feel like I am getting something out of it. In other places I paid higher resort fees and I had access to an amazingly clean fitness center, a great pool, good internet service and hassle free parking. 

Never staying in this lame hotel ever again. The only reason we made the mistake of staying here this time was because it was a last min trip and it was the cheapest option, and we were trying to save a few bucks. I would have paid a bit more per night to save ourselves from the nasty smoky smell, the gangs of people that look like the dregs of a reality show, really thin walls, dirty rooms, shitty view, and dumb mandatory resort fee. On top of that when I asked the front desk about the resort fee and why I had to pay for it if one of these facilities were closed, she literally laughed and with an attitude, corrected me to tell me that it isn't an optional fee and that it is part of the hotel fee. Wow. I am glad she knows the difference between mandatory and optional. that wasn't my question.",1
5039,"I love that Kona is now up in Desert Ridge, the macadamia chicken is one of the best dinners ever.  I also like their sushi and love their happy hour.  It is a great location with a great patio, I just wish they were open later.  The atmosphere is upscale and is a great date night place, we often go here in a large group before heading out to drink more at Blue Martini or Sand Bar.  Overall good place for any occation.",5
5041,Clean environment and friendly service. Food is fresh and well prepared. Loving the deals they offer and how well managed the establishment is. I come here to study and am always welcomed with friendly faces and fresh food. Drinks are always dispensed without delay which is to say their equipment is well maintained. Love watching football here ... it feels like home.,5
5042,"Love it!

We did Take-Out via phone (they don't have online ordering yet) and it was ready in 7-10 minutes, just enough time to drive over there.

You can create your own burgers with any number of topping - they even have different Cheeses and Buns to choose from. The Spicy Chipotle Mayo is to die for!

Expect to pay around $7 for a burger and fries. Compared to Five Guys - their portion for fries are very small. But do I REALLY need a large bagful of fries? Probably not, so it's fine. Smashburger's burger pattys actually seem much bigger to me compared to Five Guys. So it evens itself out.

If you want a great burger - go to Smashburger.",5
5043,I went to the Bell location. I have great trending style and they did not buy a lot of my clothes. Really surprised me because I shop at H&M and Forever 21 a lot.,1
5044,"Came back the next night with a party of seven and ordered the omakase. Possibly one of the best meals I've had. 

The Kobe and sea bass were the highlights but the entire meal was phenomenal. Well worth the $2,600 of our company owner's money that we spent.",5
5045,"My favorite Vegas show so far. If you're a Beatles fan you will love it (no pun intended). The music and imagery create a unique experience that you won't find anywhere else. There isn't as much aerial work in Love as there are in other Cirque shows but the music and colors and overall psychedelic vibe more than makes up for that. We sat in the second row but next time we want to sit higher up to get a different vantage point. Will definitely be seeing again someday, as I'm sure this thing will run for a long time.",5
5046,"Found a car on USAA.com, 2014 Lime Green Chevy Spark with less than 3k miles and for under $10k, went to Mark Kia on 2/20.  Spoke with Bryce Young, took the Chevy Spark for a test drive.  Prior to the test drive it was made known to us that the Chevy Spark had not gone through the multi-point inspection by a Mark Kia technician (unsure how many points, but over 100 for sure).  During the test drive the airbag light was on and the message center displayed a Code 95, the Code95 being related to the airbag system.  We returned to Mark Kia and my wife & I decide to purchase it.
At some point Mike, the dealership manager, came over with the Carfax.  The Chevy Spark has a salvage title due to having been stolen off of a dealership lot between the two known owners, though it had not been reported to have been in an accident of any kind.  Mike reduced the price of the Chevy Spark to $8,000.  Due to the salvage title we were limited to our financing options, Navy Federal and USAA would not finance the Chevy Spark unless the title was changed from a salvage one to a regular one; this would not be possible.  With limited options Bryce Young took our information to the finance department and we were approved for $13,000+ (included license, fees, & taxes) at 8.99% for 60 months, with $1,000 down.  Out Dodge Caravan is currently financed at 3.4% for 72 months.  Papers were signed, hands were shaken, and Bryce told us he would get the Chevy Spark in first thing Monday morning (2/23) to go through the multi-point inspection so that we can take it home.
On Monday (2/23), at 4:53pm, I emailed Bryce to see if my Chevy Spark was ready, no response from Bryce.  On Tuesday (2/24), at at 3:59pm, Bryce responded to me saying he had been with customers all day and that the inspection should be done by tomorrow morning (Wednesday, 2/25); I did not view this email until after 4:39pm.
On Wednesday (2/25) morning I took a city bus at Thomas rd. & I-17, traveled a total of 90 minutes, to arrive at Mark Kia just as the sales floor was opening.  Bryce was not in yet, but Mike was.  Mike sat me down in his office and proceeded to tell me that the Chevy Spark did not have any airbags; apparently when the vehicle was stolen off of a dealership lot the airbags were stripped; this would explain the error 95 code that was observed during the test drive. Mike said his general manger would be in later today and would see about installing new airbags at no cost to me.  Currently there were no loaners available for me to use to get home, but Mike assure me that as soon as one became available he would have it dropped off at my house, in the meantime a service tech gave me a ride home.  At 7:32pm, several hours after I had woken up and no contact from anyone at Mark Kia, I called 480-425-5300, spoke with Bryce, he said he was going to get with Mike and would call me back.  At 8:11pm, having not heard back from Bryce, I called 480-425-5300 again and asked for Mike, he was in a meeting with Bryce.  At 8:36pm, I received a call from a Jake/Jacob; they could not sell me the Chevy Spark due to the absence of airbags.  I requested my down payment back, I was asked if they could help me look for another car, I declined and requested to be refunded my down payment again.  I was told it would be refunded, and the refund would be processed in the morning (2/26).  At 8:40pm Jake/Jacob called to confirm my CCV code on my card and processed the transaction, at 8:43pm I received a receipt for the refund via email.

On 2/26, at 8:20am, I received a call from the bank that mark Kia used to finance the Chevy Spark under a salvaged title.  I informed them that the sale did not go through due to the absence of airbags.  On 2/27 the refund finally posted to my account.  That same day, my wife and I went to Bill Luke in the evening, purchased a 2013 Chevrolet Sonic with 20k miles, and I was able to drive off with it that night.  On 3/2, in the mail I received a card from Mark Kia.  Within it was not my $25 Target gift card, but a reloadable Visa card that Mark Kia loads when there is a successful referral.

Where did Mark Kia fail?
* They bought a vehicle at auction, either unaware or ignoring the fact it had a salvaged title
* They put said vehicle up for sale without it going through their multi-point inspection
* They did not print a Carfax until just before the paperwork was being started
* They did not complete the mutli-point inspection for at least four days after the sale
* They said they tried to contact me about the absence of airbags, yet they clearly did not despite having successfully contact me before this
* They took over 11 hours to get back to me that they could not sell me the vehicle due to the absence of airbags
* As of 3/6 I have yet to receive my $25 Target gift card for the test drive

5049,"I visited this place several times over the course of my trip to Arizona. The first time I went it was really crowded and really hot outside so we decided to go somewhere else. The next two visits we got seated quickly and the food was simple yet outstanding, just goes to show you more isn't always better. For both times I ate here I opted for the bruschetta, they give you plenty of options to choose from. The staff was super friendly, we had the same waiter and he even bought us desert on our final meal before we flew out. We really don't have places like this where I'm from so its nice to try new things! Overall, loved this place and highly recommend it!",5
5050,If I want to have the same food with the same quality and ambiance in SF it would cost me 100+. The bill came as 40 something total! highly recommended!,5

5058,"What best stands out is the service. I have been here twice and service has been consistently amazing. I would recommend starting with the table side made guacamole and chips. Nothing beats fresh made right in front of you guac! We also had the house margaritas (highly recommend it). For dinner we had the enchiladas and new york strip steak, both were really tasty and well cooked. I feel like you can't go wrong in anything you choose. 

Finally the best part of this place is that they are 100% GMO free!! What more could you want!",5

I installed a flowmaster 50 series on my 4runner. I opted to use clamps and it was leaking a good amount.

They welded me up for a reasonable price and it sounds great now! In and out!",5

I had the Hell's kitchen burger and the Damnation chicken burger and both were amazing, perfectly cooked and built with great ingredients. The prices of the burger are not even too high if you consider the location in the middle of the Strip. 

I would definitely come back if I came back to Vegas, no doubt.",5
5070,"Came in here with two out of town friends for my girlfriends birthday. We decided to try something new and after reading a few reviews decided it couldnt hurt.  We were directed to a nice table by one of the fireplaces and our server couldn't have been nicer. We had a later reservation on a Sunday and were the last table there, but never felt rushed.

The food was excellent. Everything that came out received a thumbs up, including the famous sticky buns. I had a pork tenderloin that was perfectly cooked, and no one said much we were all too busy eating!  Will be back again for sure",5

5077,"So, to add to my review, the cleanliness is seriously lacking. There was urine splashed on the inside of the toilet lid. I went to get my shoes from beside the bed and noticed 'items' left under the bed by other guests. 

I was awake much of the night due to the ridiculous noise of that elevator. 

If you're not going to offer in room wifi, at least have decent common area lounges for guests. 

I find it very telling that no one asked about my stay upon checking out.",1
5078,"My experience at sura was horrible. It was our first and our last time there. If I could put a negative star I would. We get in at about 335pm and were sat at a table. I go to get food (vegetable tempura shumai and egg foo young) well I take a seat back at the table and take a bite out of the tempura and about to take another bite and that's when I look down at my food and see a hair in my food. I pull at the hair and it ended up being a 2inch piece of hair. I told the first waitress and she apologized and took my plate away.. Ok so moving forward with our lunch not having an appetite to eat much I go and take a piece of my Kim chee and under that piece there was a piece of hair.. Talk about being disgusted.. I tell another waitress and she tells the owner and the owner comes to the table and was like I'm sorry blah blah blah.. Then the owner and waitress started to talk in their language and started to laugh looking at the plate.. Talk about feeling like crap as being the customer.. Then the owner goes well it could be your hair.. That was it, I was being so nice and professional with the whole matter after all it wasn't my fault and believe me we have the money to pay for our meal so trying to get a free meal is something I was not trying to do. With this happening twice in one sitting I am sure that I will not be returning to this place again.. Trust me it pays off to look at your food so stuff like this doesn't happen and your not eating someone else's disgusting hair..",1
5079,I normally don't write many reviews but this place deserves one !! I was in need of a fill and do to being short on time I couldn't get in to my usual place . I came across this nail shop through google. Let me tell you I think this will be my new nail shop ! Bonnie was super ! She was very understanding and helpful and made sure my nails looked amazing . I had picked out a pastel coral color and when she went to polish my nails noticed that the color was not setting correctly and on top of that she noticed that my cuticle was making my nails not look to nice . Most places would just polish and not care ! Bonnie cut my cuticle reshaped and buffed my nails and looked for another color in the same family family that would look better than the one I first picked . When it came to checking out i was assuming she was going to charge me for cutting the cuticle and re reshaping my nails !! She did not ! She just charged me for a fill w/ gel color ! I was amazed and happy that this place cares more about there work than the money !! I definitely recommend this place along with the whole staff they are pleasant and care about there clients ! Super happy with Bonnie !! Thank you again for taking your time on my nails :),5

5081,"I love the Coc, everyone knows it. ""The Coc"" is what Toronto locals call CoCo Fresh Juice & Tea by the way. I'm not sure what you were thinking I was saying but you were wrong. As usual. You have such a dirty mind.

Actually the Torontonononians don't say much about CoCo because it's as yet largely undiscovered, and definitely underrated. Which is sad, because as chains go and as bubble tea goes, it's utterly incredible.

What to get: Hot Milk Tea or Cold Milk Tea with Bubbles.
What not to get: Shingles, unless you're Terry Bradshaw.

I can only assume that rivals are writing reviews of Coco, because it's every bit as good as Gong Cha and Sharetea (the other international chains that are opening nearby), and perhaps in some ways, better.

This is an awesome little location of Coco, the place I first discovered and fell in love with in Queens (NYC) where they have several excellent locations. I first tried the hot version of their perfect, life-changing milk tea here in Toronto and it was utterly divine. My travel partner (not the cat) actually thinks it's better than my fave (Sharetea) and my 3rd fave (Gong Cha). I put Coco in 2nd place, but they're all very, very good and comparable. And the milk here is gentler and creamier somehow.

Awesome little place, ratings are inexplicable, delicious hot tea",5
5085,"we went to slate bistro while visiting some friends in pittsburgh - what a great meal!  every appetizer,¬†salad, entree, and dessert was outstanding!  the fried calamari (steak, not the normal rings and baby squids) was amongst the best i've ever had, as were the scallops (though being that they change their menu very frequently, i can't say they'll be there when you go).  and the DESSERTS!!!  the key lime cheese cake and the nutella mouse cake were AMAZING!  add this place to the list of things i miss about this great city!",5

Not only did Irina fix my skirt (which I assumed would be impossible) but she showed me what I had done wrong, PLUS FIXED IT WHILE I WAITED.  The price was great. She spent around an hour making it perfect and only charged me $20. I couldn't believe it. Best seamstress I've ever been to.",5

I didn't notice until I got home. So, I called them to verify what I bought was indeed on sale and it was. I wonder how many people got scammed on this deal as it is the last day of the sale. Gal on the phone didn't really seem to care.",1
5088,"I'm a huge fan of tendou! It is my new favourite soft serve spot uptown. They only do two flavours (for now) - matcha and black sesame, both of which are amongst my favourite all time flavours. Of the two, I actually prefer the matcha, which is ultra smooth and has that slightly bitter matcha taste that I love. It really reminds me of authentic Japanese matcha! The black sesame, I find, is not as creamy and smooth, but makes up for the inferior  texture with bold, delicious sesame flavour. I actually would not recommend getting the twist, because I find that the black sesame dominates the matcha flavour, and the two are not exactly complimentary. I like to enjoy the 2 flavours separately. I have been to tendou many times since it opened and I know I will keep coming back for more!",5
5089,"Great office staff, nice clean office, FAST - which is important when talking dentistry... And absolutely reasonably priced (we don't have dental insurance and our medical covers cleanings but nothing else)...

5095,"I have never before been disappointed in Quiznos food before. I ordered the ultimate turkey club, a fairly safe sandwich to order. They globed the mayonnaise on the sandwiches and when they came out of the toaster the sandwich racks bumped INTO the sandwich in front of it. On top of that, my mom ordered the lobster sandwich after asking the worker if the sandwich was especially fishy and she said no. She only ate 1 bite of it. Worst $20 spent. If you want good food, this isn't the place.",1
5096,I have been doin' my Vape thing with Kickin' It for almost a year now!!  Amazing guys and always helpful and ready!!  Knowledge above par and awesome juice selection!!,5
5097,Nice and elegant Barbershop I loved the service and quality of their work ! Definitely recommend,5
5098,"The owners name is Melanie... My name is Melanie but pronounced differently. That is why I decided to maybe do business with her instead. The Stars were aligned and she earned my business LOL She is great to work with. When it came to response times, she didn't have me waiting. Great customer service. We also had a conflict with the installation of our carpet and closets and she was very easy to work with. 

The quality of my cabinets are great! No complaints about the service or the material used. I would recommend her to anyone looking to get closets installed. Her prices are competitive. 

Thanks Melanie for the great cabinets! Love that we have a place for everything now.",5
5100,"Visiting family from out of town, came here for dinner last night, liked it so much we came back for lunch today!! Great food, games & now family is addicted to the OTB!! Everything tastes amazing!",5
5101,I'm not going to write some big sob story about my experience with this company. Bottom line is their customer service is horrible and they do not return your calls. They cancelled appointments and did not have the bid in on time. The job they did is sub par and if you complain they turn the other way and could care less.  Not happy with the product nor the service. BUYER BEWARE!!,1
5104,Julie is truly the best! Apartment hunting is hard and she made the process very simple. I'll definitely recommend her to anyone that may be looking for an apartment.,5
5105,"We have had a great experiences with bringing our pug, Gabby, to Karen's K-9 for boarding when we're on vacation.   We've tried two other places, and Gabby hated going to both.  And I can't blame her, she would spend pretty much the whole day in a cage with very short exercise breaks.  At Karen's she's out running around and playing all day.  Karen's has always been accommodating on fitting us in on short notice, and the staff has always been very nice.    Great place.",5
5107,"4/23/13 ~ (3 stars) I joined in Jan. when they were still doing their ""soft"" opening. The gym is nice and clean, the kids club workers are nice. My only down falls so far are the kids club still is not finished and my major issue has been billing issues from day one. I would've given it 4.5 stars if I didn't have those issues. 
5/6/13 ~ Most of my billing issues ""supposedly"" have been resolved but I'm still waiting to see them post to my bank account. 
6/6/13 ~ All but one of my billing issues have been credited back to my account. I guess it really comes down to you get what you pay for, the kids club STILL is not finished and I can't get a response when I leave a message to resolve my final issue. Cheap = low quality service. 
4/17/14 ~ In February I finally decided to cancel my membership, the gym was doing nothing but going downhill. They were running through managers so anytime I brought up a complaint a new person would be there. The kids club still had been finished, parents are donating toys since they won't invest in them. And it really wasn't worth the money, I'd rather pay more and go back to LA Fitness. So I turned in my paperwork with the last bill date for March. April rolls around and a payment is withdrawn from my account. I go into the gym at 8:20 am speak with the helpful front desk worker. He informs me that everything was entered correctly into the computer but the payment still came out and that he can't do anything else the manager will be in at 9am. Now I could've left but I didn't want to come back so I sat in the kids club with my daughter to wait the 30 min (side note: the kids club workers are amazing caring people). Needless to say I sat and waited until 9:35 am before the manager showed up. He then had to take a copy of my cancelation paperwork copy and said he'd call me around 4 or 5 pm that day. 4:30 pm rolls around and I haven't heard anything so I call and leave a message. The front desk worker calls me back and says they are reversing your charges. Whew!! That was a headache to deal with, again I can't seem to at it enough you get what you pay for. 

PS it's crazy to see how my review went from 3 stars to 1 star in a year...",1
5108,"These movers were recommended by someone on my condo community Facebook site so I thought I would try them out. I moved over the weekend and had a great experience with these movers.

5110,"The food is as great as the concept and charity! I feel lucky that Joy Bus is in our 'hood. Had the pancakes, eggs and bacon and was overjoyed to have real maple
syrup included with the perfectly cooked plate of locally purveyed food. An old Subway sandwich shop transformed into a gem! I will definitely be back. 

Now, after repeat visits, take out and eating more of the menu, I'm convinced that supporting this restaurant is not only good for our 'hood, helping the community but great for my physical and mental well being!!  What other restaurant can boast that??!!!

The filling in the poppyseed pancakes is proportioned just right- so good, chicken and waffles - delicious crunchy sweet and salty, salads - makes me feel justified, Ruben and a giant lunch burro were so filling. Go!

Today I discovered that it's a one mile walk to Joy Bus. I see more cardio in the future! Also, more good Karma!!",5
5112,"I stayed downtown for three nights, and two of my dinners were l here. That tells you something. 

They have an all-you-can-eat offering on Tuesday nights after 6 p.m. It's $28.95 for 1 hour where you can order off a special AYCE menu that doesn't include everything on the standard one, but has some things that aren't on the regular menu. Sadly, the photo I took of the AYCE menu came out blurry, and I was going to rely on it to list everything that I tried and liked. I'll save that for the update since I am going again next week.

I sat at the bar where Brian and Carlos prepared all of my dishes. Brian was particularly nice in putting up with my lame non foodie conversation even though he was clearly very busy. If he's around, I recommend sitting in front of him.

The food was great. It's definitely up there in the top 2 sushi places I have ever been to, and the other place is no longer in business. Particularly memorable was the maguro nigiri, which really tasted fresh and very tuna-like, in a good way. The ebi nigiri also tasted different from every other place I have been too I guess because it was so fresh. The texture was the difference. Each of the rolls were massive. The only item that didn't do it for me was a roll that had deep fried batter, which seemed a little heavy for me. Everyone around me was having the Poke monster, so I tried it during happy hour two nights later. Incredible, and really satisfying. 

My two hosts were Marcy and Ryan, and they are to be commended for their cheerfulness and service.

I'm going make this a regular stop when I'm downtown. See you next week!",5
5113,"I decided I needed a day to relax, detox and take care of myself. I got a detox package, with a massage and facial add on. First time doing a detox so I had no idea I'd be completely naked, although, I'm not shy.. The massage, the detox, all of it was amazing. I was truly pampered for over 2.5 hours. The staff was completely focused on me. I got cheeses and fruit and chocolate and tea following the treatment. Was it cheap? NOPE! But worth it and I would definitely do it again. I felt incredible afterwards.",5
5115,"Hello ello ello ello ......what have we here????? Nudge Nudge.....SAY NO MORE!!!!!

My Nana made a great Perch fish fry during cottage years. She is long gone but I can safely say Gordon Ramsey has done it again!!!! I have a Mancrush on this Guy!!!

If your here I highly recommend the fish and chips or anything with the Fish. I ordered the Fish and Chip Combo. 

You have your choices of 3 dirty seasonings for the fries. I got Dirty #1 chipotle, jalape√±o, crisp chorizo...The fish portions are incredible and served Superhot!!! Fish comes with sauces as well. I got the srirachi aioli. Delish. Fish Right out of the deep fry. The batter is clean and so frickin crisp. That amazing crunch sound while devouring the fish.... AMAZING. DEAFENING!!!!!
I recommend ordering a Peach Ginger Lemonade to wash it down. 
That stuff could be bottled and sold for $$
So refreshing. 
My companion got the Fishwich . Looked good and he enjoyed it tremendously. 
Wait time can be a bit long depending on time of day. We waited 20 minutes which I found to be well worth it. Food reasonably priced. Very small space and limited seating.....no problem tho.. plenty of people to watch outside the doors off the strip!!!",5
5118,"Stepping out of the car, into the deserted parking lot, I was immediately knocked in the face with the most noxious fumes ever and doubled over while shouting ""OMG, what is that?!"" My sister said it smelled like a bathroom was backed up. I should have gotten right back in the car and left - it was too telling of things to come. 

It was 2 o'clock (6/21/11.) The place was a ghost town. We weren't entirely sure it was even open when we pulled up. I had already driven all over town with my sister looking for places to eat. After coming up short, we were going to Macaroni Grill, on principle. After braving the rank smell out in the parking lot, we went inside. There were a total of three tables with people at them. After standing around for a good couple of minutes, our soon-to-be waiter (D. name protected) seated us and handed me a ripped up menu.

Man, I hate it when I wear a dress and there are crumbs all over the booth seat because they scratch the back of my legs. The seat was covered in the sharpest, diamond-cutting crumbs - and the server didn't remove the extra place settings. 

Speaking of crumbs, another waiter brought out our waters and bread, or ""prison food"" as he called it. Prison food was right! We were brought out what looked like a loaf of bread, but was actually a gigantic crouton. Yeah, for those who don't cook - don't heat up bread, especially at a restaurant, in a microwave. It turns it damn near rock solid. This bread had clearly been microwaved. Trying to break the bread required us each to look in the other direction, you know like you have to do when pulling the little confetti fireworks, so you don't pull out an eye. We had to do that with the bread lest we get a scratched cornea with a shard of bread.

I ordered the porcini mushroom ravioli and my sister ordered the Pizza Margherita. Both looked great when they came out. Look, I love mushrooms - mushrooms, onion and garlic is akin to my personal ""mirepoix."" This, this... ""dish,"" was awful! Never in my life had I needed to force myself to eat anything with mushrooms in it until today. The sauce was the consistency of milk.  Just awful. The pizza my sister ordered was so thin and floppy, all the toppings slid right off. Never mind that it was completely void of any flavor, both meals were barely palatable.

After sitting for nearly 20 minutes with half full plates of food, the waiter FINALLY told my sister he'd get boxes. Another 10 minutes later, he arrived with the box and the check. It took another 10 minutes for him to pick up the check. 

Good gawd, everything was awful. Never again!",1
5119,Absolutely awesome food!! I had three different entrees and the crab Puffs and egg rolls. Everything very fresh and very very tasty!! I would definitely track down this truck again.,5

5121,"Have never stepped foot in the actual store, and the website is a pretty standard flower shop template that many florists use, but the service has delivery has been impeccable the last two times I used them.

I called them in person the first time to confirm that the online order had gone through, and they were very friendly. They said that their online system is accurate and that there was no need to call to check. This appears to be the case, as you'll be sent an email notification when your order is processed (which happened for me about an hour after I submitted it on a weekday).

Ordered a Christmas bouquet online at 4:40pm on Thursday, December 18th for delivery on or before December 24th. Was delivered on the Saturday afternoon. Recipients loved it.

Prices are very reasonable - they have over-the-top stuff, but also very lovely and elegant arrangements for $55. Comes out to about $77 after delivery ($13) and tax ($9).

After having a few other Toronto flower shops screw up or forget about my orders, I'm not taking risks with anything else - this is my go-to flower delivery service from now on!",5

5126,"First the good points. Portions are large. The rice is as sweet and delicious as I remembered from the Los Angeles locations. This particular location had poor service. The staff was rude, including the waiter. He didn't even make eye contact. Wait, he didn't actually speak to me. He looked at me expectantly when I ordered. He dropped the food off without a word. Never checked was my food ok or gave refills. There was a boisterous group a few tables back who used the n word so freely that I assumed there were Blacks in their party. I was surprised to see when I got up to pay there was not a one. And the cashier-- she has to finish her phone conversation which may have been taking an order for delivery. I always feel staff should attend to the paying customer in front of them and then to their phone customers. That may just be me. Even though I missed this place dearly as I lived in the South for a while, I will NOT be going back.",1

I've been to Philly many times and have been to Jim's,  pat's, genos, ishkabibbles... You name it. This place here in Toronto is in the upper echelon of cheesesteak greatness. The vibe of the place is cool too and the family who runs it are very sweet. Mega passionate about doing the cheesesteak properly. Well done!",5
5145,"Love, love, love, love. I think that clearly gets my point across about how I feel about Postino. Their bruschetta, is amazing! I haven't tried on I didn't like, but I definitely have my favorites. My favorites being; the salami & pesto, smoked salmon w/ pesto, warm artichoke dip spread, prosciutto w/ fig & marscarpone. My all time favorite is the smoke salmon w/ pesto and if I could I would get a board with all salmon and pesto, but I get tempted with all the other options. 

I also love their service. I've been to three different location and I've never had an issue with the service. There's always a friendly, warm, welcoming ambiance at Postino. 

I've heard great things about their brunch and would love to pop in one of these days to explore more of their menu. If you're out of town or maybe it's your first time here, then I would go with their bruschetta because I feel like that's what they're really known for.",5

5151,"Pretty sad that I had the ""stereotypical"" car dealership experience here.  The one that everyone warns you about.  Went in on a Monday and test drove a car-was really into it-the salesman, Lon-was very nice, friendly, and helpful-the manager, I'm not sure what his name was, was pushy.  We really were just looking at this point and he  actually said ""what can we do to get you in this car today?""  Right...what he told me he was willing to do at that point was give it to me for less than sticker price and 1.9% financing.  I wanted to do a little more research before committing, so I left.  Went and checked out some cars at different places and ended up coming back to look at the same car the following Wednesday.  Same salesman, same manager, only this time the manager tells me $5k more than he quoted before and 4.9% financing-when I seemed astonished by the finance rate he acted like I was crazy.  Told me he could go to 3.9 but no lower----which was total BS.  At this point I realized he had flat out lied to me-I wanted nothing to do with his business especially since I found the same car, same year, less bells and whistles, less mileage-less money at another dealership.  It took FOREVER for him to accept my ""No"" but I finally got out of there and never looked back.  He actually told me I ""had to work with"" him on the price...though I'm the one who has to be able to afford it.  I went directly to the other dealership and bought my car and it was a fairly painless experience.  On top of all this-for the following week, I had numerous other managers from Camelback calling me day and night, people I never even spoke to.  I guess this way of doing business works for them, since they have people buying cars from them-but I just felt like the whole experience was sleazy.",1

5156,"We FINALLY made it to Luv-It last night around 10:30pm.  There were 3 people in front of us (which was great, because I heard the line is usually really long.)  We checked their flavors on our way down with our friends- Banana and Mango.  ehhh... not something we were interested in, but thats ok.  Chocolate & Vanilla are always on the menu.

Two of us ordered a vanilla & chocolate with chocolate jimmies (jimmies = sprinkles), one ordered the Western Sundae (their most popular) and our other friend ordered vanilla with fresh bananas, hot fudge and orea cookie crumbles.  The total was $18... not bad.  WARNING: IT IS CASH ONLY!  If you need to use an ATM, then you have to go to the Mart next door.

We decided to stand outside and watch the strippers walk into their place of employment- The OG.  That was fun!  haha!  We also watched a hooker get picked up by a red car.  OK, so yes, place is in the ghetto.  Was it that bad- no way.  I heard the girl that plays Kelly on ""The Office"" said this place was like hell.  Not in a million years.

If you like custard, go to this place.  I'll be going back later this month to get the Pumpkin flavored custard!  Can't wait!",5

The sauce here is unlike any other Italian place I've been to. It's peppery, meaty, runny, and an absolute delight!!! Reminds me of my mother's sauce.   

Lamb popsicles were a hit at the table and the Caesar was fresh and very well made.  

If you're in Pittsburgh you must visit!

5162,"We checked out Fresco for the first time for my birthday, and it did not disappoint! I loved the ambiance and how most of the light in the place was coming from the Orpheum sign across the street. The patio is beautiful, so I know I will need to make another trip in the summer...lots of bold patrons were braving the frigid temps in their party dresses to get pictures outside. We started with the crispy Brussel sprouts for an appetizer and they were amazing - brussels and bacon are a match made in heaven, and the app came with a dipping sauce that was mouth watering. My husband and I both had the seared scallops - the plate they brought out was a work of art in and of itself.  I'm not going to lie - I looked at it at first, and was like 'Is that going to fill me up?' but it did...the scallops were melt in your mouth tender, and the flavors were out of this world. Every element was meant to be together, from the grilled corn to the cherry tomatoes - I'm seriously drooling just thinking about it again. I sipped on one of their specialty drinks, the b-hive (barreled gin, honey syrup, lemon, up) the entire meal, and then enjoyed a cup of coffee with my birthday dessert (flourless chocolate cake). I wish I had snapped some pictures, but this is the type of place where I felt a little silly busting my camera out to take pictures of the food...it just felt like a night to just take in and sear into my memory, a rare treat!",5

5179,"I tried with these guys.  I tried.  I was extremely patient and extremely nice and easy going.  They came and repaired one of our AC units which needed a new compressor motor through our home warranty.  Although they did not show up on time, and did not show up to several recall appointments, they did initially schedule to come out quickly, within 24 hours and did the initial repair then, so luckily we were only without AC for 1 day. However the tech did a lazy job and left all our wires exposed to weather and moisture.  After contacting the company, they scheduled a different tech to come and correct the problem. It took me several messages and two weeks later to finally get this tech to come and ""fix"" the problem, only to find when I returned that he left the ground wire still out and exposed to weather and moisture.  I contacted the company right after that, which is now a month ago, and am still waiting for them to respond and fix this problem.  I have two air conditioning units, and the unit not touched by Air Pro has absolutely no exposed wires.  Ground wires and any electrical wires should not be exposed to weather and moisture outside of any protective casing. This is lazy and sloppy work.  I have attached three pictures.  The first pic is of the first terrible job, the second pic is of the second horrible job, and the third pic is of my other air conditioning unit and how it is suppose to look.  I hope that I can update and let you all know that Air Pro did the right thing and fixed this problem, but considering they've yet to get back to me, we'll just have to see.",1
5181,"Hands down, the best Italian food in the hood.

The food is always made fresh, and guaranteed to be delicious, every time. 

It takes a while sometimes, probably because everything is so fresh and made with care, but its worth the wait and the money.

I've had the pumpkin soup (it was fall at the time) and it was made, in house with freshly roasted pumpkin. I have had the handmade lobster ravioli, and it was delightful. I have recently had grilled calamari with fresh made rosemary bread... oh man, oh man.

Just go!",5

The waffles are fantastic. The shipwreck is a gigantic pile of awesome on a plate. Everything is wonderful. You could throw a dart at the menu and it would land on something awesome. The portions are NOT small-- you might be able to split something.

The coffee and coffee-like beverages are also amazing. Their chai is fantastic.

The service is great! You might have to wait a bit for a table depending on when you show up, but it's only because the place is packed so don't take it personally. Everyone's friendly and eager to help out. Definitely a busy atmosphere.",5

It honestly would be a 4.5 kind of place but I'm rounding up because of how quick the service was and the insane variety of sodas you can choose from.  it's basically the Total Wine of soda places.  I got some Leninade soda and it was delicious!  The wife got a grape soda that made you forget about any other grape soda you've ever had.  The food is great too.  I had the Santa Fe burger and it had a weird sweetness to it that I wasn't expecting (it had to be the pickles!) , and a very nice bun that absorbed everything the burger was throwing at it, and it was a lot (Good house sauce!).  Again, I will go back, and I will get root beer!",5

We had all the pupupas, cheese, pork, been with cheese and a combo of beans, cheese and pork. Really sumptuous pockets of corn based dough. Be careful, the fillings are hot. Served with a vinegar slaw and tomato sauce. Mammon, good. Did I mention they were $1.50. That's no typo. Tamales are a buck fifty too. The Elote tamale is a sweet, light bundle of yum. Beef burrito, enchilada style with rice and beans all tasting great - $6.50. Beautiful shrimp enchilada with tons of decent sized shrimp. We ended our meal with Fried plantains that were served with a sweet cream sauce - so good. Highly recommend for downtown eating.",5
5192,"Picked up two cartridges for my pen. But later found out they were not compatible.  Returned the next day , and instead of going through all the hassle of returning them the manager GAVE me the correct pen. To me, can't ask for better or service",5
5193,So I'm fake? I notice a lot of negative reviews come from disgruntled tourists so I don't think those are accurate.Lee's auto only employ competent professionals who have been nothing but honest and upfront with me. If anyone wants their car done right and less expensively than other places go there.,5
5195,"I bought a 9.9 Coleman motor which had a crack in the cover, but was new from 2010. Chris, the owner, had it set up so I could start it. The price was 1/2 of normal. They also included a gas tank and owner's manual which they mailed to me as I didn't get it when I was there. Chris and Kevin were very helpful answering questions. They both went out of their way to make this purchase a pleasant experience. Honest people who I would recommend highly.",5
5196,"We had a very disappointing lunch and certainly, Montreal can do better. 
At the height of the tourist season, between the fabulous Pompeii and Lautrec exhibitions, the Cafe should do much more to appeal to and entice visitors to our city, let alone regulars like me. 

The Cafe isn't what it used to be be. No more  onion soup and there were only a few regional or seasonal specialties. The prices were exorbitant considering the offerings.

I ordered the soup de jour, a flavourless pur√©e of potato and vegetables. My main dish, an entree of gravlax was mediocre to say the least. 3 slices of toasted ficelle with the proverbial smear of flavoured mayo. Not enough ficelle to match the salmon, I ate the rest with the accompanying dinner roll. At $13 this was not worth the cost. To add insult to injury, my accompanying baby arugula greens were topped with a disgusting piece of mystery object (dried arugula?), something that should not escape a cautious chef's eye.

Lunch for 3 without wine, tip or coffee (we all ordered the appetizer plates and there was one other soup) was $83! 

The only positive note was the service of our waitress. She was very attentive and professional. I did, however, note that there was a couple who stood for about 10 minutes before being greeted or seated by the hostess. They weren't happy either.

I think that the Cafe has many problems which should be sorted out quickly before it's too late.",1
5199,"Tofu chili mint is AMAZING!!! Also good with soy shrimp! Its not minty, its just fresh basil, garlic, chili, and bell peppers, and it is yummy.  My second fave item is the vegetarian panang...chock full with veggies and flavor!!!",5
5201,"Oh wow. That's real Mexican place. The food I had was great. The salsa was hot enough to burn through the table, since I specifically asked for the extra spicy one - was not disappointed :-)",5
5202,"Jennifer was our sales rep. Right when we walked through the door she assured us that she was here for us and not against us. With the reputation that mattress sales people had, it took a lot to break down the stereotype. Jennifer did it! She listened to what we were looking for and what we need. She lived up to her word, and I am so grateful! I was planning on doing more shopping around, but Jennifer made it to where I didn't need to. I'm astounded at her customer service!",5
5203,"There are so few ""cool"" chains, particularly in my area, and so I was very bummed about its closure, though not really a surprise.  They never seemed all that busy--never a good sign for a restaurant in a high rent strip mall.  Food was always fresh and reliable, and I never had a problem with the service.  I will miss the opportunity to get a complete, healthy, balanced meal for around $10 and the ability to sample their falafel for the price of ""Please""!",5
5204,"I ordered cupcakes for Valentine's day and three months later I'm still dreaming about them! The two flavors that I got were Red Velvet and Rocky Road. What sets the Red velvet apart from other red velvet desserts is that there are chocolate chips baked into the cupcake, the icing isn't too sweet and the texture is just perfect.  My absolute favorite was the Rocky Road. Marshmellow, almonds, and chocolate... it was delicious. I'm usually not a fan of eating icing on cupcakes but I devoured the whole thing because it was that good. I can't wait to try other flavors like the Irish Car bomb. 

For any occasion, I recommend Kole's Kakes. You can't go wrong, and the price is super reasonable.",5
5205,"What a great spot to catch breakfast or lunch.  The owners are friendly and run a great restaurant!  The staff is excellent also, serving delicious, hot fresh food.",5

5208,"This is by far the WORST place my mom could have gone after trying to kill my dad and herself multiple times. Social worker John Kelty will not return our calls and they are letter her out free to go back ""home"" without talking to the victims or finding out if she even has a place to go. She has multiple felony charges and has been determined by the Chandler POLICE DEPARTMENT to be a danger to herself and to society. I have called multiple times and left multiple messages to no avail. I am so frustrated right now because I now have to move my family to a safer place. THANKS A LOT!!! This facility will be hearing from my lawyer if she hurts herself or anybody else.",1
5209,"I took my first private instruction class today.  This is a great studio.  The instructors that I met were very friendly.  They pay attention to your body positioning, which I always think is important.  I've taken classes at a few other studios (both in the area and outside of PA), and this one is definitely one of the best. I look forward to working out here...and I never look forward to working out. :)",5
5210,"My husband and I have been going to One Self Therapy since Fall of 2017. We found them through Living Social deal.  
I was a professional massage therapist for 5 years providing deep tissue massage.  I'm impressed with  this establishment.  They are professional and provide massage to clients at affordable prices.  
I have utilized Several massage therapist at this place. 
Hands down Leah is amazing.  Her experience comes from a background in massaging clients for chiropractic adjustments.  She knows the muscle groups and attachments associated.  She can find the areas of acidic buildup and work them out.  She is great with trigger points that release tension.   
I have also had a massage from Kenta that was relaxing and provided total relaxation.   Brittany has massaged my husband and is amazing with deep tissue work.  
Bottom line is this place is the best!!! You can pay a one time annual fee of 25.00 and have discounted massage rates all year.  If you haven't tried them you are really missing out. 
Also Olivia if Rejuvenating Skin Studio is located inside One Self Therapy.  She is amazing with personalized skin care treatments.",5
5211,"I had the best baja fish taco of my life here! And I get fish tacos everywhere. It was so flavourful and delicious and was very filling. 
I had an octopus taco too, which was pretty good. I also tried a bite of the spicy shrimp taco and this was amazinggg. I will definitely be returning for more! Yummm",5
5212,"Not to be negative, but this was a really weird experience. I'm a visitor from N.Y., and I asked for an appt., and I got one pretty quickly considering I was only in town for about 10 days. I was put on a waitlist, then put in from a cancellation. The person I spoke to touched base with me very quickly, so I'd give them 5 stars in that dept., they were very prompt. I sent her an email of my hair and the style I was hoping for. I sent her pictures of my hair wet, and one picture of it when it was blowdried straight (w/o my permission), and 1 or 2 of the style I wanted (a simple pineapple bun with bangs).

She told me she doesn't do updos, which was no problem. But then she said that she couldn't help me because people come to her for ""cuts, curly styles and education and are not ironing their hair."" I kept trying to tell her that I don't iron or even blowdry my hair ever, it was just to show the length of my hair, but she basically brushed me off. I told her that I was struggling on styling my hair and I just wanted some help and insight on how to handle it, and it was like the second they saw my hair mildly straightened, they couldn't be bothered to help me. On the one hand, I appreciate the idea of being honest so as not to waste anyone's time, but on the other I feel like there was bias and a huge wall put up the second they saw my hair. I don't think I was really given a fair chance at all. I didn't understand why one picture of my hair that was blowdried months ago, without my permission, when I've been natural for almost 3 years, was enough to condemn me. I asked for an explanation as to where their concerns were, and was never contacted again. Disappointing, and strange experience. Honestly, it made me feel really bad because I've just been trying to figure it out for so long, and a place that seemed like it could provide real insight just couldn't be bothered to do so. I was really excited because other reviews are amazing. This was truly a let down

**disclaimer: I didn't get a real chance to even use their services or visit their location;  this is just a reaction to how I was treated as a potential client. Your experience may be different. I'll include pictures**",1
5214,They are very attentive here! They were fairly busy but I did a walkin and had about a 20 min wait.... Good sign they are busy but will try an appt next time. Massage chairs are ok but not the newer nice ones.,5
5215,Whoever gives this company a 2 star or higher is a liar.  They are either paid or affiliated with the company in some way.  I'm excited to finally cancel our service with Century Link. What good is paying for internet if it doesn't work?  I don't know how many times we have been in touch with them for hours and hours.  OMG!  How is this company still in business?  Can somebody shut them down PLEASE!?  It will save alot of people headache.

5217,"I *rarely* give out 5 star reviews, but this was one of the most perfect brunch buffets I've ever experienced.  Great service; really awesome setting right outside overlooking the Four Seasons Pool in the massive Mandalay Bay complex.

They had several stations (omelets, donuts) but the quality of the food - even the simple stuff - was really excellent.  Incredibly good cheese selection, even.

I highly recommend the Bloody Mary Bar - with house-infused jalapeno or bacon vodka with optional bacon or jalapeno-salted rim.  And lots of house-made pickled peppers and veggies!

It's really hard to find fault with this dining experience.  Going back for dinner next time. ;)",5
5220,"I bought the Groupon deal 20 classes for $25. I went to about 10 classes before giving up. 

Getting there: located on Dupont, there is enough free parking on the street. 

Facilities: the gym is up the stairs in a shady warehouse. At the start of class people skip rope in the hall way on cold concrete because the ""gym"" itself is a poorly ventilated, sweat-smelling, thin-carpeted, old and cramped room with one boxing ring and some hanging punching bags. I can't get over that I actually went to the disgusting gym as many as 10 times. Some days the stench was so bad that I gagged a bit. Not to mention that the dumb bells are always wet with other people's sweat. And NEVER use the community boxing gloves. It was the most disgusting thing I ever did. 

The class itself: while the Groupon advertised boxing classes, it was more of a boot camp class. Tony, the instructor, lazily pulls out a card from a deck and states the number of drills we would do. You can take advantage of the class and push yourself as hard as you want to but the gym members aren't particularly motivated. Some days in the last half hour he would have us punch bags, but wouldn't direct us how to do it properly, so I never learned anything.",1
5222,"The food here is delicious and the restaurant is small and cozy! I really enjoyed this bar with their craft beers and unique cocktails. The food had a great spice, and the bread pudding was TO DIE FOR. I am one who avoids desert and eats healthy but every bite of that Nutella bread pudding was worth the calories.",5
5223,"Happy birthday to my wife! 

We came here to celebrate and get the night started. But last night, we were not so happy about the food and drinks and ended up paying for a free birthday dessert.

You see the picture!? Looks good right? Not!
The fries were super salty and stale.
My burger was dry and burnt on one side. 
I asked for medium well, they cooked it extra charred! Ha!
I got it replaced. The second one was good.

The drinks were really watered down and to much ice..
It was a strawberry hurricane and a blue citrus something. I don't think those were the right cups for those kind of drinks.

Now it's dessert time! So we already told the waiter it's our birthday. He said we can get a free dessert. Great! We ordered one vanilla bean cheesecake. We took two bites then asked for a box to take it to go.

We got our check and I was charged for 3 burgers, 2 drinks, and dessert. Now hold on wait a minute! It was 2 burgers and the waiter said we can have a free dessert. When I asked him again he says only the chocolate sundae was free. Wtf! But you said.. you know what nevermind! He didn't even bother to fix it. There goes his tips! $12 tip went down to $1. 

Next time I come back, this better not happen again.!",1
5224,"I ordered Kung Pao Chicken to go. I got home and opened it up and all I saw was onions! And theses weren't even scallions, they were sliced strips of yellow onions and the box was half full of them. I had to wade through the entire package to find a few tiny bits of chicken and a few peanuts. It tasted okay, but it didn't taste even close to what anyone who has had Kung Pao Chicken would recognize. I dumped literally half the contents of the box down the disposal. I ate what little chicken I could find. It's a Thai restaurant who makes Chinese meals, but they don't do it very well. Won't be back.",1
5225,"I absolutely love this place! The charcuterie board is great! Their pizzas are amazing! Oddly enough, my favorite thing on their menu is their minestrone. Soup is not usually my thing but this minestrone is so fresh and delicious. I'm obsessed!",5

5229,"I just took the full day racing adventure in willow springs driving cobras with my buddy. My buddy bought this as a birthday gift for me and I have to say WOW..... this was a awesome day and experience. 
As the day approached the owner emailed us and asked if we would want to switch days due to our day not being full. We explained that we couldn't and Dave completely honored the day and was there ready for us. Cars and everything were completely ready. 
Dave wasted no time showing the cars and explaining how the experience worked. Quickly we were driving and learning about race car driving. He showed us tons and tons of useful techniques and tricks for driving. We had lunch and the entire 2nd part of the day was all on the track. 

The cars are awesome.
The teacher Dave was awesome.
the entire experience was awesome.

Super fun and not only do you drive these cars... YOU learn how to drive these cars...

Highly recommended. Thanks Racing Adventures and thanks David.

5239,"I normally, do not right a negative review, but after two years in a row of I normally do not right a negative review, but being robbed and abused by this company, the time has come.  There needs to be a ZERO rating.


Under no conditions, ever use this company anywhere.   ******

In 2017, I went to Hobby Airport,Houston and booked the supershuttle. They came 1.5 hours late. I called them and said, make sure you come on time on the return trip from Sugarland back to Hobby. They did come and time and called a yellow cab  to pick me up which they paid for.

Now in 2018 Jan. 26th. Book everything in advance. They have my flight number getting in 10 minutes early at 10:00 PM. I expected them right outside the door. I waited. Nada. There was another gentleman also waiting for the same shuttlexpress. He was going to downtown and it should then continue on to Sugarland. I went into the office desk of Supershuttle, four times over a period of an hour, pickup up the phone and getting the recording five minutes each time.  Finally the other gentleman an hour later 11 PM took Uber and I took a cab for twice the price. On the return trip from Sugarland, I booked a cab at twice  the price of the Supershuttle. 

When I got back to the hotel at midnight, I checked my credit card and supershuttle had already charged me the full 58 dollars after never having showed up.  That is theft. 

So, I filled out all the web forms and called supershuttle four more times.
I asked Supershuttle to reimburse me for the 70 dollar cab fare plus the amount they already took from my card. I had to wait 12 days and the 58 dollars they charged was returned to me.

They REFUSED to compensate me for the 70 dollar cab fare. I was only asking one way, not both ways.  I am doing as I said to the customer support person.  I have used services all over the world and never had this treatment.",1
5243,"Update!!! 

Used to be my go to nail spa for 3 years. Lately ownership has changed and the nail techs seems to have a chip on their shoulders. I'm a good tipper, $20  minimum. I love getting my gel mani and gel pedicure. Last time I went in,a guy, who I will not name because although he treated me very badly this time used to be one of my favorites, he ruined it and I will never return. One strike and I'm out. When you spend over $100 bucks every two weeks, good tipper and always show up for your appointments... no reason to get talked to or treated the way I was. Online searching for a new place. Good luck",1
5246,"Not the experience we were looking for.  I have had this on my list of places to check out in Vegas for a couple of years.  Certainly didn't expect Sports to be blaring on multiple TVs in every room.  It was so noisy in there, we left after our appetizer.",1
5249,Has a rustic feel to it but decorated like a cute baby shower. as soon as you walk in you get a whiff of the sweet marshmallow scent. Hence the name fluff it. The service was excellent! I don't know if they always have this deal but there's a $2 drink menu or $2 off a specialty drink. I got one of their specialty drink called bam bam. If you're a fan of fruity pebbles then this is the drink to get. Not only is the drink blended with fruity pebbles but they sprinkle fruity pebbles on a scoop of marshmallow placed on the shake. They also put a block of fruity pebbles marshmallow through a straw. I didn't really care for the block marshmallow but the scooped marshmallow was so delicious! The drink was very tasty and had a hint of tanginess to it,5
5252,"I've been living in Broadstone Arts District for nearly a year, and I have to say that this is the absolute best apartment complex in all of Phoenix. Before choosing Broadstone, I visited at least 20 different properties in the same category, but nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing came close. The first thing is the location--McDowell and Central is an ideal spot that gives you access to everything.--bang opposite the Phoenix Theater and the light rail. The second thing is the quality of the construction; they used really high quality materials all around, and it shows. The walls and floors are thick--I haven't heard a neighbor since I've been here. And all the fixtures around the apartment are top quality. The amenities are first-class: the pool is gorgeous, the gym is fantastic, the digital concierge makes getting packages a snap. And I like that the building is super secure (requires a fob to get around). 

I've had only positive interactions with the management. Alyssa really went out of her way to help me get the paperwork done fast and to get settled. And Jasmine has been fabulous--any time I have a request or feedback, she listens carefully and takes immediate action. The entire team has been extremely helpful with every request. And the place is really really well maintained--pristine--the pool, the grounds, and the building.

The management takes the time to organize regular events for the residents, and goes the extra distance to have a variety of interesting activities. They regularly sponsor an in house artist and host art-related events as well in keeping with the theme of the building and its location.

I'm writing this review because I know how hard it is to find the right place to live, and I just wanted to share this with anyone considering Broadstone: It's a decision you will thank yourself for making.",5
5253,Called and made an appointment for 3 people. Waited 15 minutes before anyone started on one of us. It was not busy (2 other customers in the salon). Took 30 minutes before anyone started on the next person. If you didn't have staff to cover the 3 of us you should have told us on the phone when we called. We called AHEAD of time for a reason.

The biscuit was even small and dense. Not at all like other bojangles I have visited.

There are a lot of machines, so even when it's busy you can usually find some open. There are TV's, vending machines and a sink to clean up if you need it. There is always an attendant on hand and they spend a lot of time keeping the place clean, tidy and putting the carts back so you can easily grab them. No one likes doing laundry at a laundromat but this place makes it as pain free as possible.",5
5267,"This place is downright AWFUL. Went here on a Saturday morning for brunch. Only two other small groups were in the restaurant when we went, yet the service was still terrible. The waitress had an injured leg, yet management still thought it was smart to seat a group upstairs. Due to her struggling around the restaurant it caused our service to be slow. 

We all (3 of us) ordered bloody mary's. When they didn't come for twenty minutes I went to check and they had been sitting on the bar the while time. When we finally got them (anther ten minutes had gone by) they were watered down and tasteless. This was potentially the WORST bloody Mary I have ever had in my life. 

The food was not good either. It wasn't terrible but it was extremely sub-par. All ordered omelets. Supposedly comes with toast and jelly. No jelly was given until we asked. Came with home fries which were nothing more than a cut up potato warmed up. 

Overall, I would never eat or drink here again. Unfortunate too because it could be a cool local spot.",1
5269,"This place is my weakness! It's a good and  bad thing that it's nearby. Good because, as a local, I don't have to drive far for beyond amazing bar food or a cool atmosphere. Bad (well not really) because there are so many great and truly unique menu items to choose from, you'll eventually wind up ordering them all--warning: leave your diet at the door. Must-haves at BAR include the Texas Nachos, Buffalo Mac n Cheese, Tequila Lime Chicken and The Chicken Katsu Sliders. All are more than generous portions and are seasoned to perfection. I say this because most bar food is an afterthought and pretty bland. At BAR everything has it's own flavor, often unexpected. For example, for dessert I asked if they had brownies--which are my favorite--the sever didn't hesitate to recommend the Brownie topped with Cookie Crisp cereal and whipped cream. Who does that?! They did and do and it's why BAR is one of my favorite dining outlets in the Silverado Ranch area. Also love the fact that it's 24hrs and it doesn't try too hard to be ""hip"" or ""cool""...it just is.",5
5270,"Been coming here for over 10 years and this is a first.
Ordered my usual lunch, and the fries came cold over cooked and greasy, ( they were deep fried twice). My sandwich was good though so I let it go. However, my wife ordered fish tacos, and the fish were cold in the centre, and the lettuce was brown and wilting. After one bite she stopped eating I pointed out these issues to our server, she apologized, took our plates, and then charged us full price for our meals that we couldn't eat. We paid our bill and left. We are the worst kind of customer, we just don't go back, and we pass on this experience to others.",1
5273,"Absolutely perfect from start to finish.  The installatation, of a fairly large project, went flawlessly during the scorching summer heat.  Karen's absolutely essential and out-of-box (but not killer expensive) design ideas can make a huge difference.  I have posted before and after pictures under Robert S. The yard actually looks better now (picture was taken before I figured out how to stop rabbits from eating the ground cover...""first world problems"") because Rolling Rock came in with some additional and replacement plants and additional decorative rocks (they have this great source so you can avoid generic boulders and gravel).  

Jim is a star with a heart of gold and is right in there with the guys.  Once it gets going, it is like a choreographed dance.  Like any small company excellent in their area, they get very busy and can't please all the people all the time...but t they try!!!

Once they are working with you, you are part of their family.  They come right out if there are any issues and have more than stood by their warranties (without us having to ask for them to stand by their warranty...they just do it).

We wouldn't have used anybody else.",5
5276,"One of the best sandwiches I've ever had! I love that there still exists a place on the strip to get cheap, quality food. All of their sandwiches and salads are $5.99 and packed with quality and flavor. Best of all, they're open 24 hours! Luckily for me, I stayed in the Westgate Towers at Planet Hollywood so we were only a stone's throw away from Earl's. Among my group of friends, I bet we hit this place up at least 5 times a day. My favorite is the club sandwich. The bread, ingredients, and special sandwich sauce they put in all meld together perfectly. Their chicken caesar salad is also delicious (croutons were on the salty side but no matter). Yes, the line can get long but it goes by really fast. Clubs, gambling, and other shenanigans are fun but Earl's is definitely gonna be my reason for returning to Vegas.",5
5277,"I was in Phoenix on Sunday to celebrate Father's Day.   On Monday, as I was leaving Phoenix to head back to southern AZ, I stopped at On The Border with my 2 children to eat lunch before our long drive home.  Brittany seated us and was also our server.  She was lovely and recommended the specials that day, although we didn't go with those.  I ordered the Queso Chicken which was very tasty and perfectly cooked.  My children got the Fajita Chicken Soft Taco and the Build Your Own Mini Tacos(chicken).  They ate every last bite which is rare when out at restaurants as they are very picky. On the Border definitely measures up to their standards which is hard to come by.  Brittany was very attentive, friendly, and efficient while not overbearing.  She knew just what I needed when I needed it.  One thing that I feel bad about was that I paid with Credit Card and placed the tip on the receipt in the space provided.  However, once the charge went through my account, the tip was never charged to my card...leaving Brittany without her tip.  I called but the gentlemen explained to me that there really wasn't anything he could do.  So I would like the manager and anyone else who might visit to know what a great job Brittany did!

5282,"The best thing (for me) about Yinzburgh BBQ is that it is vegan friendly. Seriously? A veggie-friendly BBQ place? Why bother? Well, I love BBQ sauce and all the sides that go with it, so I really appreciate this place. 

They have a smoked block of tofu, a tofu wrap, and tofu salad, plus veggie sides like collard greens and Mac and cheese. The tofu is amazing. It is dry-rubbed, like all their meats, and it's delicious. You get your choice of sauces with your meal-their signature red sauce is the best.  I think the Mac and cheese is also amazing-I watched them make it the last time I was there and it's all from scratch.  

The place is really geared toward take-out; there are a few tables and chairs and a tv. Parking is available across the street at Einstein bagels.",5
5283,Very nice staff and the Doctor as well...Jennifer took her explaining every thing to me.,5
5284,"They claim the ""meat"" is cut off and reheated....it's not. 
Staff is really nice-food is really bad.",1
5285,"We come here every once in awhile when we need our curry fix. Spice level IS spicy so fair warning. The parking isn't the best, but it's sure worth it. We're from Hawaii so the spam katsu is yuummm! Fried oysters is a must try as well!",5
5289,Rom and Danny came out couple days after I called and had me up and running again on my Samsung dryer in about 30 minutes. Price was fair.  I like that they showed me the exact problem that needed to be fixed. Would definitely use again if needed. Thanks guys!,5
5290,First time at gauchos and was really impressed the food was excellent and plentiful but what most impressed me was the service which was absolutely wonderful I highly recommend this delightful surprise to anyone,5
5293,"Had the ribeye, which was delicious. My friend's filet mignon was also perfect. Food and ambiance was great, and servers were quick and helpful. I was in a big group (six guys) for a bachelor party. The manager even sent over a free round of drinks for our celebration! If I'm back in Montreal, I will definitely make it a point to eat here again.",5
5295,"Horrible. Got here to be told that they only accept priority pass until 3:30pm. I asked for it in writing and they said ""we don't have it anywhere in writing but we've been doing this for 3 years"" So yeah, thanks for nothing :/",1
5296,"I am a newbie BIG time to this whole industry. I decided to sign up for Med Marijuana card for the pain I have caused by PD. I walked in feeling very inexperienced, ridiculously inept and self conscious. Front desk was genuinely welcoming and helpful - ready to make me feel at ease.  I was then lead into the product area by Rodrigo R. who, right away, was very friendly. Not the forced friendly. I got the feeling that was his nature. He asked me the ""why"" behind getting the medical Marijuana card. He knew & understood about my PD and the pain. He knew which strains would be best for my type of pain and he was knowledgeable about the amount. And seeing how ""green"" (pun intended) I was about it all, Rodrigo was very patient with me since I needed pretty much a picture drawn out for my naive ass. I will always be very grateful to The Holistic Center for making my first experience a very pleasant one.",5
5301,"The worst foot spa I could ever get .
All he did was touch the feet and move his hand over my foot , it was like his hands will telepathicly release energy and the massage will automaticaly be done.
Please take my advice and save your 20$. Not sure why this place has such good reviews .",1
5302,"The owner (Troy) and all the baristas who work here are all very kind, accommodating, and full of great suggestions.

I personally love their kona cold brew (when I act like an adult- it's strong and is a bit of an acquired taste) and their coconut haupia lattes when I want to feel like a kid (sweet and delish).

Their croissants are always fresh and butterly flakey (I get a bacon, egg, and cheese on a croissant when I'm hungry, or on an onion bagel- both are delicious), peanut butter chocolate chip muffins, butter mochi, and coconut haupia bars (kind of like a frozen coconut cheesecake!).",5
5304,"Doh!   I was hoping I had made a rash decision with my first failure here.  So I called again yesterday and I was put on hold FOREVER.  What is the secret password for someone to help a customer?  Do I need to ""know someone"" to be treated like a  human?  Come on, is there a poker game going on in the back because clearly they have no need for new customers.",1
5306,Awesome selection and quality all you can eat. The dining room's a little small and the wait staff a little awkward. But overall very good for the price.,5
5308,Great fast service. Awesome job I will highly recommend this place my phone screen looks brand new.  They price match so I got a great deal.,5
5309,"I can't say enough about Scottsdale Shea. There are times in your life when you or someone you love needs a hospital. It doesn't matter if it's elective or an emergency. The level of care is remarkable and the personal attention is so pleasing to experience. The care that this hospital has given to my parents, brother, sister, and myself I will never forget. Life sometimes hands us uncertainty, it's nice to know that Scottsdale Shea has has it covered!
Thank you",5
5310,"I originally posted a review of this golf course on their Facebook page however they deleted my review. This course also made no attempt to contact me and make things right or even try to apologize. I called this course about enrolling my child in their junior golf league. I spoke with Tim on the phone who gave me a many reasons why my daughter shouldn't/wouldn't want to play in junior league golf ""with the boys"". Tim also stated if my daughter did play, she would have to have a friend join as well. Having a friend join with you isn't a condition for boys to play junior league golf. My daughter was discriminated against. My daughters abilities as a golfer or her many years of experience did not matter. I'm disgusted by the way this was handled.",1
5312,Omg.. the wait is ridiculous.. my partner and i went there around 2pm and it took almost 20min to order and another 20min for food to be served.. the food was O.K. .. the service is very very slowwwww..,1
5313,"We tried Rotana because of the Groupon deal. We found a sign on the door saying that they no longer honor Groupon or Yelp. Because we had committed to meet another couple there, we decided to stay and eat. The service was very good as was the food. But because of the duplicitous nature of them luring us there, we won't return and I can only give them one star.",1
5314,"The host at the entrance did not have great people skills but once we were seated, the waitress was amazing. The food was excellent. We started with the chip trio which was a white cheese dip with jalape√±os, salsa, & tasty guac! My husband and I shared the steak and shrimp fajitas which were so tasty also. I wanted to try the nachos since that's what drew me there but after the appetizer of chips, wanted something different. So good!",5
5316,"Food is amazing! We had chicken and rice, okra, Alicha (sauteed cabbage, potato, and carrot), and Sambusa (fried pastry with beef). Service was good. Very helpful and friendly. Will definitely be back!",5
5317,"We got married in April and made our way to Sage for dinner. What a great experience! Top notch food, fantastic service and a great atmosphere. Please go to Sage, and tell everyone you know about it. We live in the Midwest, and have already made recommendations to everyone we know!",5
5318,"went here two weekends ago and it was sooooooo gooood.
we had the ginger beef, a few different kinds of dumplings, shrimp and
vegetables and it was delicious.  everything was served piping hot and
fresh and the atmosphere was cute, clean and nice. two thumbs up.",5
5320,First timers at this resto. There was a line but our wait time was about 10-15 minutes. All crew was very nice and professional. Didnt wait long at all for our food. Super large portions at a reasonable price. Chicken Fried steak was off the hook. Ordered the Scrambowl and I was overwhelmed with the amount of potatoes. Food was delish! Our waitress checked up on us frequently OD us with coffee which was awesome! Love this place!,5
5321,"Had a great experience from the beginning. No questions left unanswered. No continued service needed but if so, I would be comfortable with asking them for help. Highly recommended!",5
5322,"We had the all you can eat for $26 and had lots of very delicious Tapas!! Our favorite were the bacon wrapped dates, pork empanadas and chicken green chille skewers.  The red sangria was very good!! The service was wonderful too!!",5
5325,"Everytime I come to Vegas this is a must for me , I love there steak and eggs yummy yummy. I even think about this place when I'm at home. they also have great machines that pay I always do good when I stop in for 2-3hrs.",5
5329,"i can proudly say that when i was in college over my time there i ate every single sandwich on the menu (back when my body could take the abuse). Best sandwichs on the menu. Fat F, Fat MILF (best), Fat Sorastitute, Fat Cowboy, and a few others i can't recall. Worst are Fat Caesar and Fat Falafel, bleh those were nasty. 

This is a college staple and where you have to go if you have never been their before. Grab a six pack and drink while you wait. Eat it while its fresh it will turn nasty in your fridge. 

place is packed when bars close but empty just about any other time. Its super unhealthy but will sober you up in a minute. 

Good and Bad, at night they will take your name then call it when your sandwich is ready, BUT, they will ask you what you ordered. Its really hard to remember after a night of drinking so concentrate! They do it because people try to steal sandwiches.",5
5332,I love this place. Exactly what we needed to get away from Vegas. Perfect energy and the best sleep ever. Reminded me of being back home as a kid.,5
5334,"Love India Garden! The food and service are great. They are very attentive, warm and hospitable. It has a very mom and pop vibe and almost makes you feel as though you're eating at an Indian family's house. Definitely recommended.",5
5335,"This place is my first experience with Jamaican food.  I first tried their jerk chicken with fried plantain, and I loved it.  The chicken is juicy and tender.  I tried a different thing each time, and nothing had ever disappointed me. Their menu is small and you can try them all in one time if you are throwing a party : )  Their veggie patty is yummmm!!
^^ The jerk chicken is better than those I had in Jamaica. I'm glad that I had given P Jay's my ""first"" ^^",5
5337,"My experience with this towing service was great. Water pump went out while at Sema. Rafael in truck #46 loaded and unloaded my Modified Mustang up carefully. Being it's so low to the ground, he took his time making sure he didn't cause damage. Thank you Rafael.",5
5338,"Ok, I'll start by saying to be fair, the two staff members I interacted with were perfectly nice and helpful and the main ""dining area"" was clean, but god damn the food is soooooo gross, and it's very expensive considering how gross it is- over $3 for a crappy cheeseburger that's more sauce than burger and over $4 for the most disgusting chili cheese fries I've ever had. I love chili cheese fries, I get them everywhere! The fact that I 1) couldn't finish them, 2) didn't want them to go and 3) didn't even consider taking them with me to try to give to someone else and instead just threw them away cuz they were so gross is really, really, really saying something!

And the bathroom, which I used after I was done with the super gross excuse for food, was also pretty dirty. The place was totally empty and there were no cars in the drive through (it's a wonder anyone would come here for a repeat visit as there is much better and cheaper stuff in the same area), and the two staff who were there were nowhere to be seen. It's not fair for me to say they were ""doing nothing"" just because I couldn't see them, there is a now hiring sign up and they could be catching up on shit or something back there. but it's definitely not a good look on your business to have only one customer around and your customer toilet seat looks like it hasn't been cleaned in a week, especially when your ""food"" is also super disgusting.

I feel so ripped off, almost even scammed, and I wish I could get my money back. This place seems like they are trying to be in-n-out, which I guarantee you is far superior to this place regardless of how you feel about them. To charge the prices Tommy's does for such garbage is criminal. What a huge waste of money.",1
5339,Exceptional service and quality of work. I had my formal gown altered for my daughter's wedding. Laurie took the time to fit me in around my work hours. She worked with me to make my dress and plus size figure look elegant.,5
5340,"Got this letter from Bookmans today over my 1 star review.

.............................

Dear Sean,

We're sorry to hear you aren't as enthusiastic about Bookmans as we are. We base our purchases and pricing on the basic principles of supply and demand.  Unfortunately, this means that we aren't able to take everything people bring to us and our offers reflect the desirability of the items we do take. While we'd love to have you shop with us, perhaps another retailer may better suit your needs. It takes all sorts of businesses to create a healthy local economy.  Best of luck and have a good day.

Sincerely,
Katie Downing
Store Manager
Bookmans Phoenix location

..............................

Notice how Katie calls me stupid, as if I don't understand the principles of supply and demand.  Tell me Katie, do you understand the principles of vulture capitalism?  Here's a little hint, if I've reviewed a business with a 1-star review, it should be assumed that I am already choosing another retailer that DOES suit my needs.

Another example of why you shouldn't shop at Bookmans, where the staff thinks that they are smarter than you...",1
5342,My favourite restaurant in the whole city. The charcuterie / antipasto board is amazing. Ingredients are so fresh. The margherita pizza is a must try. The primavera white pizza is also incredible. Thy the caprese salad for an EXPERIENCE. Service has always been great. Been coming here for years.,5
5343,"I have eaten prepared food here several times and found it delicious and well seasoned. I liked the food so much, I had Fou d'Ici cater a meal for 22 people and was extremely happy with the entire experience. They worked with me to create a menu that accommodated the vegetarians, vegans and meat-eaters perfectly - and I was very happy that the menu fit our limited budget without compromising quality or even quantity. Everyone I dealt with was friendly, helpful and professional, dealing with my questions, requests, and changes promptly.  I agree with the feedback I received on the meal that it was ""really spectacular"" and ""incredible, I want it every day!"" I highly recommend Fou d'Ici if you are looking for someone to cater your next event!",5

5347,"I loved this place! I hosted my sisters baby shower here on May 19th. It was the perfect location. We created two pieces that we hung on the baby's door and in her room. 

Nicole was great in helping her guest complete the projects. The studio is decorated beautifully and is located in a great location. 

We had absolutely no complaints!",5
5348,"Copy of what I wrote on their Facebook wall as it will probably be deleted by them.

First trip ever to Vegas. Saturday, Started the afetrnoon by getting a quick bite at the Bistro Buffet. Then 2 hours into my stay, i get trapped at a slot machine for 1 hour bc your system crashed. I couldnt get up to tell my husband where i was bc then some one could take my seat and my money as the machines were not printing vouchers. After complaining to management i was told we had a 75$ food and beverage credit. Yea right. Wake up at 3 am sweating, shaking, heart beating, freaking out. Call front desk to see if there is a hotel Doctor. No. Spend the next 5 hours vomiting from a nice case of food poisoning. When i finally could attempt to drift off, room next door was having a party. its 4 am. Security is called. They finally stfu. Next day, double check there is still food credit. Low and behold, no such credit exists on our room. We are lucky enough to find the same manager who issued it. I notify him of my episode of poisoning and ask if the credit is good for food in the gift shop as i refuse to eat at any more resturants in the Palms for the remainder of my stay. Yes he says, of course. We stock up on drinks and food for ur 5 hour drive home. Having a feeling there would be yet ANOTHER problem, we keep the receit and open NOTHING. I ask if the room next to us has checked out and if they have not, we'd like another room. The did, but the noisy bunch of girls was replaced by a nosier bunch of MEN blasting Katy Perry at ! am. Again, Security is called. Im so ready to go home and never come back to vegas again at this point.  Its monday morning  7 am,we are cheking out early to get home for a Dr appointment and Of course!( as expected almost,) THE CREDIT DOES NOT COVER GIFT SHOP FOOD. The gift shop refuses to take the returned unopened items, Yes HERES THE PART where i throw my luggage on the floor and go ballistic. After 30 mins of threatening to call my lawyer, finally they declare my balance at ZERO. I kept the reciept as im sure they will start charging us randomly, since they are clearly so unorganized and shady. Retrain your employees Palms. Thanks for ruining my trip. Next time we will fork over the extra money and stay at Caesers. I cant believe two people in 2 days could have so many issues with 1 terrible resort.

Ps. I made a yelp account just to warn others of your HORRIBLE MOTEL. You should feel honored.

pps.  ps. theres no shower doors so its freezing, theres no complimentary items in the bathroom except shampoo and lotion, so i had to blow dry my hair each morning which is a pain in the ass as i have enough hair for three people. We were lucky to find a pen, and i could hear construction above us. Ive had better times at a DAYS INN. Oh and way to try to sneak in some ""MINI BAR CHARGES"" upon my check out, Im not stupid enough to even glance at a mini bar. Palms is unapologetic and their customer service is a joke.",1
5350,"I have never been more disrespected in my life then I was today. I called to set up an appointment for my free message. Apparently they won't honor my free message cause I didn't prepay for another message. This makes no sense to me. How could you offer a free message if you have to prepay for the service? I was told during my last visit that they would honor my message. Instead of this happening   the owner called me up and instantly started yelling at me how I'm not worth his time and he isn't going to give me a message. As I tried to explain what I was told he instantly started talking over me and arguing with whatever I was saying and started calling me a liar.  I'm disgusted with this companies customer service.  If you like mediocre messages and liked to be disrespected this is the place to go!

This place continues to sicken me. They have the nerves to call me up after I post my review and continue to attack me. Tell how I have made them angry now and basically called me dumb for not understanding their ""policies"". They should of been clear on day one what their ""policies"" were and what they were doing with my stamp card. Instead they just come up with their own rules on what they want to do when they want to do it.

Point proven on how horrible these people are. They harassed me In phone calls and continue with their reply to my comment. When I was handed my stamp card Beverly stamped it for both of us. Never offered each of us our own and continued telling us that when we get it filled out one of us could use it for a free hour massage or split it up. When I told Beverly we were moving she gave me my last stamp and said no could use it and get my free massage.  When they found out we weren't going to continue with their business they started attacking me on honoring what they promised. A professional company would have apologized for the miscommunication instead of instantly getting nasty. What you guys lost out on is a positive word of mouth for your business.",1
5351,"At last, Mr. Lee's Woonam Jung adds AYCE Korean BBQ to their menu. Ordering their tender, delicious Kalbi a la carte certainly put a hole in my pocket. As tasty as it was, I had a difficult time paying $30 for a plate of it on top of whatever entree I ate. Sura has some serious competition now that Mr. Lee threw his hat into the AYCE KBBQ ring. 

For a measly $26 at dinner, you can fill your three stomachs with all the Kalbi you want and your other three with bulgogi, chadolbaegi (thinly sliced beef brisket), samgyupsal (pork belly), dak (chicken) bulgogi , deh ji (pork) bulgogi plus the steamed egg and doenjang jjigae (soybean soup) traditionally served with a Korean BBQ meal. Given you have six full stomachs and still have room to spare, all of this and more is 'bottomless' and you still get a 5-star worthy selection of fresh banchan. 

Think of those pricey front-loading washer/dryers. Yeah, those shiny, fancy ones that are so quiet you can take a nap in the laundry room. They're considerably less annoying than their top-loading ancestors. Where am I going with this? Woonam Jung uses the fancy front-loaders of BBQ hoods--nearly silent and 1,000x more efficient. You won't have to project your voice over a noisy fan and you'll go home smelling like your perfume of the night instead of grilled meat. 

While Woonam Jung doesn't look like much from the outside, the inside is nicely decorated and has this Asian tranquility thing going for it. In short, it's a more luxurious establishment to stuff your face. If you want to up your dining experience or fancy up the act of over-eating, Woonam Jung's food presentation, modern plates, and cute server uniforms will not disappoint.

AYCE BBQ is available at lunch-time. But I hope you like bulgogi because kalbi isn't served until dinner. And if for whatever reason you're not into the AYCE BBQ thing or great deals make you feel cheap, BBQ is still available to purchase a la carte and their other entrees are flat out delicious! The yukgaejang and dolsot bibimbap are two of my favorites.",5
5354,I was very impressed with the professionalism of the company. I reauested a quote and 2 days later they were at my door and finished my truck. My F-150 turned out even better than I imagined. Thank you very much.,5

Then I was taken to get X-rays, and finally taken to the exam room.  It was a really nice office and super friendly staff.  Probably the best office staff I have ever experienced.  The dental assistant, Wanda, was so kind and it really made me feel comfortable in the office.  I'll be going back to get my cavities filled there because I was really impressed with the professionalism of the entire office.",5

5365,This place is amazing. It's a couple of blocks from my house. The atmosphere is probably the best I've ever seen. Very trendy. Love the concrete floors and interior metal gates to separate different areas.,5
5366,The garlic lime chicken with mashed yuca is an excellent reason to eat lunch there. I knew it would be good. I didn't expect the dish to become my number 1 favorite dish immediately.,5
5368,"Excellent Beer and appetizers and service. I highly recommend for tapas, good beer and cigars during happy hours. The calamari was excellent and cooked to perfection.",5
5369,"I went in to see Dr. Guyette for a root canal extraction. I was a little worried about the procedure, but the ambiance of the clinic, which feels more like a spa, set the tone for the remainder of my experience. The staff and Dr. Guyette spent an hour in the consultation room walking me through all of my options. Once I made a decision, I was walked through the ""how"" in such understandable terms. The procedure went swimmingly! Dr. Guyette later called me to check on me and took the time to answer my questions. This was definitely the best doctor's visit I've EVER had. I can not recommend this clinic enough.",5
5370,"As someone who literally went to Lux 5-6 times/week, it's no surprise that I sing such a song of praise for its next door neighbor Pane Bianco. Chris Bianco is a bread-making fiend. Everything about this place- I love. Sure, seating is only limited to the picnic tables outside, but the whole point it to grab a quick sammy and goooo. The lines are long during lunch hour, but they are efficient and quick. Ingredients are fresh, and most are locally sourced. My favorite sandwiches are their house-made mozzarella/basil/tomato sammy which they offer daily, and their occasional roasted lamb market sandwich with arugula. No matter what you get, the flavors are fantastic and the bread is so rustic and delicious. 

Most of the time I ended up eating half and sharing with someone else because they are filling. When my appetite isn't too big, I go for their foccaccia of the day, which changes daily but is no less amazing. Particular favorites utilized ingredients such as roasted shallots, dried figs, poached plums, goat cheese, and so on...it's hearty enough to be meal on its own and it's under $4.

They also offer a couple of market salads, which I never really tried and they've got a selection of artisinal/gourmet cheeses and pantry goods imported from Italy. If they've still got some vanilla bean pudding-- go for it!

Notes: Parking is tight as they share with Lux. They've got parking on both sides (bigger lot is off of Turney) and ample street parking on Turney as well. They close as 3PM, so get there early, and they are only open Tues-Sat. You can call orders in ahead of time, and if you want to eat your lunch inside of Lux, they allow it!",5
5371,"There is a new self service check in system that truly is not customer friendly. You key all your information in & then set and wait to be called. Today I did just that only to watch customers by-pass it & be helped ahead of me. The counter lady just said ""O, sorry the thing has been broken & I just didn't look"". Where is the face to face friendly staff from before???",1
5375,"This place might have the best coffee in the world for all I know.  I've never tasted it.  I moved here from Seattle and attempted to find a single estate bean similar to one I'm accustomed to.  I visited this location but they were sold out of the beans that I would have liked to have purchased.  I was told that the Scottsdale location would be stocked and worst case they'd have some the next day.  I tried to call Scottsdale to make sure but they didn't answer so.  I decided to drive there anyway only to be disappointed when they were completely sold out as well.  I returned the next day to Tempe and sure enough they still had empty shelves.  I told a barista the story and instead of apologizing she insolently reminded me that she wasn't the one that gave me false information but they should have stock tomorrow.  Well, I've heard that one before and don't plan on wasting any more time trying to give this business my money.  I'll search for a roaster that can deliver a quality bean without the pretention,  attitude, and empty promises.  I suggest you do as well.",1
5378,"Very nice (and clean!) rooms, great staff (front desk, service, breakfast). Nice breakfast area. Free parking, with a short walk to the STM station in Longueuil. This is the place to stay if you're visiting Montreal, and don't want to hassle with driving in town and finding [expensive] parking.

Definitely arrange for this hotel through their web site so that breakfast is included! The prices are very reasonable.",5
5380,"Both my girlfriend and I have concluded that Wild Mango is poorly executed, expensive Italian-Asian fusion.  Maybe our expectations were too high?

The decor reminded me of Melting Pot.  I did enjoy the privacy and the ambiance.  However, the chairs were uncomfortably hard and too large for my 5'1"" girlfriend.  She could not sit with her back to the chair without lifting her feet up off the ground.  And the menus are printed on really bulky and obtrusive wooden surfboards.

The food:
- They gave us two pieces of bread - the croissant-like bun was stale and hard; the other was burnt but tasted sort of like Asian bao bread, so it was okay.
- The calamari was sliced way too thin, and I could only taste the breading.  It was seasoned with their version of Chinese five spice, which had a flavor profile that is best described as off-putting.
- The chicken trio: The chicken cheesecake looked and tasted like a cheeseburger (it was okay). The middle chicken slices were overcooked and dry.  The chicken drumstick was good but the mashed potatoes that it was embedded in were not.
- The duck was also seasoned with the five spice, but I managed to bear some of it because they also added a bit of sugar.  It came with sweet potato mash that wasn't sweet and tasted kind of disgusting.

Our waitress seemed hesitant and sort of uncomfortable talking to us.  Maybe she wasn't used to having actual Asian people eat here.

We didn't finish our meal, went home and had microwave TV dinners.",1

5383,"Initially we really wanted to go to Mooyah, but after our bad experience there we decided to go against that and settle for McAlister's. And boy are we happy that we did that, we had a great meal and it was all very affordable. The people that worked there were such a delight and did their jobs well. The employees that would gradually walk around and ask us if we were in need of anything we're such a big help to us because we do have children and they do constantly ask for Stuff. The best part was as they didn't even seem agitated they seemed more than happy to assist us with whatever we needed, and my wife and I really appreciate that. Thank you.",5
5384,"Perfect every time!! Have several favorites from the menu...hummus platter with seasoned chicken and thousand beans with side of broiled chicken are both green options for healthy eating!

5388,"Oh, I love Capital Grille.  For us, it's the standard bearer when it comes to a steakhouse.  So when we were in Vegas for our anniversary and needed someplace to celebrate the day, there was no question where we would go.

Of course the table was decorated when we got there and a handwritten note was waiting for us, with a wax seal.

We almost always order the same thing: lobster and crab cakes for an app, we both have a lettuce wedge for a salad.  I have the filet and the husband has the kona crusted ribeye.  We'll vary on what we have for dessert.

I love the Bohemian there - it's an awesome champagne drink that has raspberries in it.  It's almost worth a trip to the Grille just for that.

Anyway, our experience here was wonderful.  Our minor quibble is the lobster and crab cake weren't quite as good as we were used to, but everything else was spot on.  As they sometimes do, they came out with a complimentary dessert of a small cheesecake and espresso cake with ""Happy Anniversary"" written on the plate.

I really wish they would open a Capital Grille in the Bay Area.",5
5389,"This was my first time coming here and my boyfriend decided to take me because they have penguins! Its beautiful inside with alot of fish and live carousel where it shows sea turtles, sea lions & sharks. Theres also restaurants. Its a great place to take children! I 100% recommend.",5

5396,"My husband took me to Top of the World for my birthday this weekend and we had a great experience. While we waited for our table we went up to the lounge above. Live band and attentive bartenders. Great place just to have a few drinks. Our server Lou was great. She was very honest about food options and she was attentive. We both ordered the pre-fixed four course meal. First course we had Caesar salad which was delicious. Second was crab cake for me and saw bass for my husband. Crab cakes were so delicious bursts of so many flavors cilantro and capers tasted great together. Sea bass had great flavor but it was on the small side, but great flavor. Third we ordered filet cooked medium. It was delicious with mushroom sauce and string beans. Fourth course were two measly mini desserts it was disappointing. Dessert is what we always look forward to. One bite was a bananas foster which was really good the second bite was a dry chocolate with some fruit jelly maybe raspberry it wasn't good. But it didn't ruin the experience. Ambience is nice and romantic. Even though I have lived here for 8 years I never tire of looking at the valley lit up at night. We had a great experience and will go back!",5

5400,"Another Sam Fox restaurant? I am there! 

Went there for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and walked in and was seated right away. Great weather to eat outside. The service was excellent and the patio was spacious and perfect. 

Had the Diner Burger with a scrambled egg and 2 egg breakfast. The burger was excellent and prepared as requested. The 2 egg was was good and came with seasoned potatoes which were very well.

Have been wanting to try out this restaurant and will come back for dinner soon.

Thank you again Sam Fox!",5

Second time, was told by the receptionist ""Sorry, we can't help you with that,"" and after saying that she hung up on me. Considering this company's website describes residential concrete work, and that it was recommended to us by a friend who had residential concrete work done, was surprised by this response. Would have been great to hear what the does do, and perhaps a recommendation for another company more in line with our needs.",1
5406,"My favorite Mexican food in north Charlotte! We always sit at the bar where the bartender, Nacho, (yes that's really his name) takes great care of us. My fianc√© and I always get the cheese dip and arroz con pollo (with cheese sauce instead of tomato sauce).  The service is always on point and the portions are huge!  The restaurant stays pretty busy even though it's off the main road but there is plenty of seating.  Clean restaurant and always an enjoyable experience!",5
5407,"It bums me out to say this, but we did not have a good experience here. We were seated directly next to the kitchen which was uncomfortably hot, so much so that the table next to us asked to be moved because it was so bad. I wish we had moved as well because that one tiny bathroom-sized vent was definitely not large enough to cool that size room. When we left, we discovered that with the misters on, it was actually cooler outside on one of the warmest days of the summer so far. 

Service was fine, but food was pretty lackluster. We started with the tuna poke which was good, but not great. My fianc√© and I both had the beef tenderloin with mashed potatoes and garlic spinach. Flavor was ok, but the steaks were rare to blue when we both ordered medium rare. We let our server know (no manager stopped by), but didn't even bother asking for it to be re-fired to the temperature of our liking because it was so hot in there, that we were mostly set on getting out as soon as possible. Against our original plans, we were wooed by the desert choices so we hung around for that thinking that might save our experience, only to be let down by that as well. I ordered the tres leches cake with plum sauce on the side. The cake was boring, the whip cream had a strange menthol flavor (I think they were going for mint, but it tasted very artificial), and thank goodness I had the plum sauce on the side because that was so bizarre -- extremely medicinal tasting and completely inedible. My fianc√© had the flourless turtle brownie which was dry as all heck and literally had one pecan in the entire thing. It tasted like I tried to make a microwave mug brownie but cooked the crap out of it. $120 out the door for a very mediocre dinner. We will not be returning.",1

5420,"I love this gym! They always have great music, it's never over crowded and everyone who works here is professional and courteous. The hassle of getting here when there is a home game (street closures) is well worth it. The personal trainers are unique and have different styles and Mark (training manager) seems to do a great job pairing customer with the right trainer. If all that wasn't enough... The clientele who come to this gym are here to work out. No perfume, texting while hogging a machine or creepy guys who follow you around the gym as you do dead lifts (ladies you know what I'm talking about). Great gym!",5
5421,"I love Presidential. I've used them now 4 times. All of the drivers have been great. They have always been on time. I have modified reservations with no issues. The cars were all new and clean, smelled great. The sound systems were kinda weak, especially in the 12-14 person Escalade. It sounded as if they had no rear speakers. 

I've done point to point transfers, the airport transfer, and the tour. The tour was fun, but the wasn't really a tour as much as it was a chauffeur to a few places. Luckily I know the city well enough it was not an issue. The champagne is usually warm, and its nothing fancy, but it tasted alright with ice. We had no problem killing the bottles in a few minutes, so it couldn't have been *that* bad. But like I said, its cheap champagne, its a nice touch, but shouldn't play any factor in picking Presidential over a competitor.

I have seen some people on Yelp that have had some customer service issues, and i've seen Presidential's response and it does seem to come off a bit abrasive. Hopefully I am never on the receiving end, and a lot of it seems to be people not reading the details,etc, but I do think it could publicly be handled in a more elegant fashion from the companies side.

For me, I wont use any other company in Las Vegas for limo service for my future visits to this wonderful city. It sure beats a rank smelling cabby or fighting to avoid the ""Fast route"" aka the tunnel.",5

5437,"Take note...this is probably the most honest (and longest) review of New Results Medical Weight Loss that you will read.

First, spoiler alert: New Results does not have any magic ""NR-3"" pill or magic plan to make you lose weight. They don't have a patented ""latest weight loss"" trick and they don't have their own brand of protein bars and shakes. Their medicine and supplements have been used for dieting for 40 years. You don't see a doctor every visit, but not sure you'd want to pay for that anyway. The first visit with Brett and the weight loss team comes across as a well practiced monologue and includes a 20 minute instructional video. They talk about everything you'd expect...the really hard first days where you lose a bunch of [water] weight fast, then the longer phase 2 with slower but still real loss, and then the transition period. Kind of like every major diet book out there (see? nothing new). Brett is totally a friendly, maybe salesmany personality and gives you a great ""Go get 'em!"" speech to pump you up, gives you your appetite suppressants, supplements, and meal plan and sends you on your way. The only thing missing was the ""this is a pound of muscle/this is a pound of fat"" demonstration. You could almost buy a $10 book for the same info.

And I'm still giving it 5 stars. Why? Because Brett really does seem to care. He's passionate about this topic, and it bleeds over into his staff who are fantastic. They are honestly the most encouraging group of weight support people I have ever met (and I've met a few). And cost? How about way less than all the ones you hear on the radio. Call around and check...you'll see what I mean.

Here's the deal. I know how I lose weight...I've successfully done it in the past, on my own, without any expensive doctor visits. I've counted calories, counted points, analyzed different foods, gone caveman, low fat, high fat, tracked food and weight religiously, and seen the pounds slip off over time. I've done enough fad diets that I feel I have a pretty good understanding of calorie deficits, how my body burns, etc. 

Nevertheless, I found myself now 60-70lbs overweight and the heaviest I've been in my entire life. I was borderline depressed about it and just couldn't motivate myself to get back into the pound per week habit over 8-12 months. I would get 2 days back into it and give up because it just seemed sooo looog till I'd hit my goal. I honestly felt like I had one more try in me and wanted to get it right.

This is why you go to New Results. If it's your first time trying to lose weight then they will provide tons of good education. Eye-opening education. But lets face it...most of us who are trying to lose are familiar with the drill. What I lack, what we lack, is motivation to get over the hump. 

When you go to New Results, you are not buying a magic pill or special home delivery meal plan. You are buying a weight loss education and ideology that includes great coaching, accountability, and a few little tools that help smooth out the experience. This is where Brett and his staff shine. You walk in and his staff actually greets you with a smile...it's like they are genuinely happy to see you. Brett's the first to tell you that their low sugar, low carb nutrition plan is nothing new. But he does explain why it's a really great option for fast, true, healthy weight loss and helps you understand how to do it. You get tools to make it more comfortable. You get coaching and encouragement. You get motivation to not eat that free cake and ice cream at work today because you have a weigh in coming up.

No, you don't see a doctor much. But you are initially seen by a real medical doctor who is accountable for making sure it's safe for you to use the medicine, checking your heart condition, writing you the prescription, and determining how you respond to it. I have to assume that unless he wants sued he's monitoring things behind the scenes and not just writing blank checks...er, prescriptions.

Is the price a steal? No. But it's not robbery either. Like I said...call around. I found it way cheaper than every other place out there with the almost identical plan. And you are getting a doctor monitored weight loss plan.

Bottom line: The speals at first seem a little rehearsed and the whole first visit seems pretty choreographed. The medicine and techniques are nothing new. BUT...the medicine and techniques work. The staff is crazy friendly, encouraging, supportive and helpful and it sets them apart. If you follow their plan, you WILL lose weight faster than anything other than bariatric surgery. But furthermore, you will understand WHY you are losing weight and what lifestyle changes are needed to keep that skinny body. They put it in your hands, but they also give you all the tools you need to succeed. Now it's up to you...is it time? Then go visit New Results.",5
5439,"First off I'm not the type of person who wants to give restaurants a bad review, I like to leave my remarks. 

First time trying Jasmin Express Cuisine, and I'm very sorry to say I AM DISAPPOINTED.

Went there ordered my food, the guy named Chris said it would be ready in 15 minutes but I was there for 45.

I ordered Veggies Fried Rice, Fried Tofu, and Tom Ka Chicken...

My Wife is a Vegetarian so she eats tofu to substitute meat, out off all the restaurants we have ordered tofu from...this order was just nasty. Very very, and I mean VERY soggy. The Veggie Fried Rice tasted like shit, and on top of that they failed to mention that the Tom Ka Chicken was a soup..it was separated to the ""soup"" section.

And one more thing, the guy Chris not to give an insult but loosen up kid... your too nervous. Instead of saying ""hey, hey you"" ask people for their names for they're order I promise it'll be easier on you.

Never eating here again, Golden Phoenix is waaaay better and quality.",1
5440,"It's been years since my band and I recorded here, but I couldn't forget the experience if I tried. Aside from the crude child rape joke that made me want to knock the hell out of our producer, the work in general was very lazy. I wouldn't record at Full Well if the time was free.",1
5442,"I am a ""first-timer""... i knew exactly what I wanted. well, more or less.  The owner Mark is who I went with.  Everyone I asked recommended these guys due to being sterile.  I came in with a design.  Mark decaled it on me, and as we went along, he did some examples of possibilities with a ballpoint pen.  That was great because we altered it a bit.  I'm very happy with it.  I would definitely recommend you ask any artist you go with about their policy for interacting with you during the process -- I had a friend go with another artist there (Chris) that did not get that back/forth feedback, and in the end he needed to go back and have fixes to the tattoo.  But Mark is the bomb: very communicative, and a great artist.",5
5445,"While on a trip to Toronto we decided to stop in here and take a break. My wife ordered the iced coffee and I just had an americano it came to 8.43 mostly due to the ice coffee as they charge over 5 bucks for that with tax. After my wife decided to take a bathroom break the server came over and bussed our table????? I was done but before I had the chance to react she was pouring my wife's drink down the sink. I could not understand what just happened? My wife came back and said ""Where is my drink"" I looked over at the server who was singing a song that was playing out loud like nothing just happened and said she took it. This was the strangest feeling. I would suggest if you order here you clearly tell the staff to not bus your table under after you leave.",1
5446,"Ordered a sofa and love seat combination  and was told it was on back order and would be delivered in approximately 11 days. On the approximate date of delivery, nothing happened and we never heard from anybody.   I called the sales department and asked for a copy of the order  since I misplaced  my original copy and the man told me he would email it to me and also said he couldn't tell me when the furniture would arrive. The next day I still had not received an email copy of my order so  I called the store and  asked for a manager, which they refused to connect me with. They said managers are for ""operations"" only. They sent me to the customer service department where I was told that somebody should have called me  regarding the delivery date as well as she apologized that I never received my copy via email. I was also told they could not give me an ETA on the furniture delivery. Somewhat sarcastically, I  then asked could  delivery of the furniture be next year? She said  it could be next year as they have no control over the manufacturer. I couldn't believe what I was hearing.   If they treat you this bad before you get your furniture, imagine how bad it will be after!   When I said I was going to cancel my order the answer I got was ""that's fine"". I promptly canceled  my order and will  NEVER shop here again.  I ended up buying two sofas from La-Z-Boy which I absolutely love and the service was outstanding. No comparison.",1

To make it worse NOT EVEN A WEEK with my nail and they started lifting and when I went in to see if they could help it fix my two nails that were lifted they blamed me for being careless and blamed my profession AS TEACHER as a reason to why my nails lifted.

5465,"This was super overdue, but we FINALLY got a chance to go back to Angry Crab Shack. Unlike our previous experience, this one was absolutely AMAZING!!! The estimated wait time given to us was about 40 minutes so I grabbed a margarita from the bar, but it ended up only being about 20 or 25 minutes. Our waitress came by soon after to grab our order. I got a pound of shrimp, head off, with 4 pieces of sausage in medium trifecta sauce and a piece of cornbread. My boyfriend got a pound of the vegetables with 4 pieces of sausage in hot trifecta sauce and gumbo. It didn't take too long for our order to come out; everything was piping hot and looked absolutely delicious!

My shrimp was so so good. I'd say that medium was just the right amount of spice for me .. spicy but not too spicy with a lot of garlicky delicious flavor! The sausage was kind of an after-thought, and next time, I'd probably skip it just because the shrimp was so much food! Surprisingly, the vegetables were really good too. The bag had an array of different kinds including broccoli, bell peppers, even some pineapple, as well as ones that we actually didn't know what they were. I love cornbread as it is and thought the one here was phenomenal. It was more cake-y than what I've had at other restaurants, which was fine. It was super moist and had a bit of sweetness. My boyfriend who typically dislikes cornbread thought it was good too! Lastly, the gumbo was super tasty. It was thick and chunky with lots of little shrimp, pieces of sausage, etc etc.

The prices here for a pound of seafood are pretty fair. The next time I return though, I'd most likely be inclined to order just a big bowl of gumbo and cornbread.

Our waitress was really attentive during our visit. She made suggestions for food, came by to check on us, grabbed us refills and our check in a timely manner. Like I said previously, this experience so great, we'll definitely be back!",5
5466,"This place is AMAZING. Probably the best sushi I've had in Toronto (and I'm the biggest sushi snob ever). It's not to be confused with ""food court quality sushi"", which you would automatically assume it is since it is underground in the financial district). I would recommend ordering some of their specialty rolls (Diablo for the raw salmon lover, Black Mamba, and Teriyaki Bomb). They make it for you on the spot. Ingredients are always fresh, and the rice is on point (I think the quality of the rice and how it's cooked is so underrated in sushi!!). It's a bit pricey but worth every penny to treat yourself! My coworkers are also obsessed with this place and we make a sushi run about once every 2 weeks.",5
5468,"Great place, great food, great service all around. Big selection of beer, and you are able to sample if you prefer before you order your drink.

5473,Excellent food and atmosphere. The entrance is a trip with the fake door and hidden window. Service is a bit slow but the food was delicious. Had the chicken piccata with mushroom risotto and would order it again. The rest of the table loves their meal too. Dessert....equally good. Go!,5
5474,"I'm not a huge fan of restaurants on the Strip. Food is similar even across cuisines and it's very over priced.  Picasso is an exception.

- Service is perfect. Polite, helpful, not too intrusive
- The space very nice.  It's not too dark, well spaced, and the art is beautiful.  It's not too loud and because it is well spaced, you don't need to worry about others being part of your conversation

I had the four course pre fixe:
- First, they were totally on board with my celiac disease restrictions.  They said they would make anything (aside from a couple of desserts) gluten free.  So no restrictions on what I could or could not get on the menu!
- The amuse-bouche was refreshing and I usually don't like cold soups
- The pork belly and pea soup was smooth, tangy, and the pork belly added a nice pop
- The ruby shrimp was ok.  I probably should have chosen the foie gras
- The veal chop was tender, juicy, and savory and the horseradish was very nice every third bite or so
- The flourless chocolate lava cake was delightful.  Rich and not too heavy

Although I'm not a huge fan of walking through the Bellagio, I'll do it to come back to Picasso.",5

5486,"Glen ""the manager"" was extremely rude !! Not only did he talk to me rudely but also hung up in my face when I was asking him questions about when the money will be put back in my account after being charged wrongly . Never will I order from this location !!",1

5490,"Yelp says Bites and Brews has closed, which isn't exactly true... It's still there, in the same location.  However, everything decent about it has changed.   They used to serve excellent pizza, sandwiches, and salads with create-your-own pencil and paper-style menus.  Crumpled and DIRTY menus with a few sandwich options and tacos have replaced it.  Our waitress told us that they haven't been serving pizza for five months.  

We had chicken quesadilla to start, which contained canned chicken (or something that they dredged in water?).  Even though we explained that we were going to share, we didn't receive plates or napkins.  The gross quesadilla was followed by tacos that were even worse.  The ""fried chicken"" taco was a chicken finger cut in half on a flour tortilla, with a ranch and mayo sauce.  The pulled pork taco (recommended by the waitress) was completely inedible.  It tasted like it had been saturated in root beer and vinegar.  It was also covered in a mayo-based ""sauce.""  

Besides the disgusting food, the beer was slightly flat and didn't taste normal.  I definitely won't be back.  Too bad this place changed... 

Go to Harris Grill instead if you're on Ellsworth.  It's overpriced for the food quality, but at least it tastes good.",1

5493,"This is my favorite Mediterranean place in all of Arizona.  The food is fantastic. Sylvia and her staff provide amazingly warm and friendly customer service.  Gyros and shawarma are amazing.  Best hummus is the valley.  Would recommend to anyone looking for authentic Mediterranean cuisine.

5495,As good as it gets is an understatement. Had the egg drop soup it was delicious. Had the orange chicken the best I ever had. My wife had the noodles and shrimp fantastic. Topped off with buddah beers and pot stickers. Service 5 stars food 5 stars. Then the owner came up and made us some walnut shrimp OTH.  What an incredible restaurant. an absolute must go back.,5
5496,This place has the best chicken stops.  The crunch on the fried strips makes them that much better.  We had the wasabi sauce.. My fav..  Buffalo.  Very good..  And the sweet and spicy.. Also very good.  The wasabi has a mild heat.  Nothing to be afraid of because it also has some sweet to it..  The Mac and Cheese ROCKS!!!!,5

5498,"I work in the area and this is one of my favorite lunch spots. I probably eat here 2-3 times a week. The main reason I love this place is the variety in dishes they serve for their lunch buffet. Most other places I've tried they serve a limited number of dishes and chicken is the primary meat. But here, they got chicken, goat, fish, etc. And they seem to put out a couple new items a day so it doesn't get old or boring. They also do brunch buffets on Sundays too. Great place for healthy and satisfying lunch if your into Indian food.",5
5499,"I don't like my experience with the boss at Otani Noodle. Their advertisement states that if we order their food through eat24 app, we will get a $2 discount. I asked the cashier about it, and the cashier turned to the boss. The boss thought we couldn't understand Chinese and yelled to the poor cashier saying that 'Of course no!! We can't give them the discount!!' This is not how you conduct business.",1
5500,"My (now) wife & I had our post-ceremony lunch here with our wedding party.  

First of all, Mother Bunch was one of the only restaurants to take our 20-person reservation which we obtained 90 days in advance. Most other venues wanted either an outrageous deposit, couldn't guarantee seating together, or demanded we pay for their catering instead of the usual retail menu. MB said yes right away and never looked back.

MB went above & beyond in every single way imaginable. Champagne for the wedding guests, our own dedicated server, and even a few conversations with management to ensure our ""big day"" was going well.  We were treated like friends of the owners instead of annoying customers with a large party to accommodate.

My only constructive criticism would be that we had 1 server to cover a table of 20 people, but honestly we were all having such a great time it didn't matter.  Plus the server herself was polite & enthusiastic in every interaction.

I literally would not have changed a thing about my experience at MB, and now our families know why we love it there so very much.  I wish I could give more stars!",5

5512,Decided to try out this one for breakfast with some out of town guest.  Hummmmm...  Definitely overpriced!!!  A two egg breakfast was $20 ... Four for breakfast was $80 and one in my party did not even eat we shared a fruit plate... Definitely not worth the money and since we were the only table in the dining room you would have expected the service staff to be falling over each other to wait on our table... NOT.  Don't think i will be returning and will not recommend to anyone else... Good Luck!,1
5514,"Maybe it's just me but Raising Cane's is not for me, whatsoever. I do have to admit that this is my first time here and maybe it's just this location, but I have a feeling it's not. 

I'm not sure why anyone would like this place, the food is meant for the palate of a child.

1) The Chicken - there is litterally no seasoning in the batter, I'm sorry but what is the point of having anything battered if it has no flavor? Just adding carbs and fat for no reason?
2) The Fries - these remind me of some cheap frozen crinkle cut fries that you would get at the grocery store... especially ridiculous since del taco is right across the street and their crinkle cut fries and pretty good.
3) The ""Texas Toast"" - mine was only slightly seared on one side and the other side is raw, this is not appetizing and immediately gets soggy.

The only thing I can think of is that people like their sauce? and that you are suppose to just put it over everything and that helps make up for their horrible food? I'm not a big fan of mayo products so it wasn't for me.",1

This place sucks they will charge you entrance fee, then they give you a stinky used jacket which it has never been clean before with dirty small gloves, then they will have you lock your phone in a locker so you don't take any pictures so they can charge you for pics. 
Their ice room is one small room which is made out of ice walls and few ice sculptures. 
NOT WORTH THE MONEY.

Deron is the one person I would always ask for and rent from whenever I am in vegas.  I am surprised he is not a supervisor or someone superior of this company because he is the type of person who is a great asset to an organization and will be a great leader for all the representatives who doesn't understand the meaning of ""customer service"".

5526,"Valastro Sunday Gravy, I was NOT ready for you! When I read the ingredients listing for this dish I just didn't believe it. I honestly took it for a joke. It was no joke. Valastro Sunday Night gravy is one of those thick, rich and hearty Italian dishes that you imagine Sophia would be cooking for the Golden Girls on a cheesecake and ice cream night. So saucy and full of meat, meat,  meat!!! Veal, sausage, pork, meatballs and bones. Ohhh the lovely bones. I ditched the rigatoni for spaghetti and I was soooo satisfied. Shame on me for swooping down on the soft and super tasty basket of bread like a starved hawk. So much bread made for a crowded tummy but I couldn't help myself. Butter and olive oil for sopping weren't necessary. That's just how tasty the bread was. Dessert??? There was no room and no way. This ain't The Olive Garden. The chefs in Buddy V's ristorante were definitely paying attention to their Italian grannies in the kitchen. I'm sure of it.",5

5543,"I had low expectations because the reviews weren't amazing but I was really pleasantly surprised!! 

First of all I have to comment on the service...AMAZING. probably the best service I've had at a restaurant in a long time. Our waitress was extremely attentive but not invasive and never left us without a full drink (in some tiny glasses!) We sat at the pizza bar and some of the chefs behind the bar checked on us as well and were interested as to whether we liked our food. Every person I encountered on the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. 

Now the food, we started with the wedding soup which was very tasty and had lots of ""stuff"" in it, which is great! Next was the mambo pizza and one more (whose name I forget) that had ricotta, Peruvian peppers and sausage. Both were Delicious. The crust was crispy on the outside and slightly charred, and the inside was soft and doughy. The toppings were plentiful and extremely fresh. Half a pie was enough for both of us. 

Finished a great meal with a piece of tiramisu, which was delicious and was inhaled so quickly I can't comment on it much more. I thought the ""m"" on top in powdered sugar was a cute touch. 

The atmosphere inside was loud but in an energetic way. Just be wary if you prefer quiet dining because there was definitely not a quiet spot in the place. I liked sitting at the pizza bar because we could watch the chefs work. For two sodas, soup, two pizzas and dessert the bill came to $59.",5
5544,"I was a Five Guys loyalist for a long time and kept hearing about Uniburger as having a better burger.

I finally got to go today and it did not disappoint. The service was slow but the wait was worth it.

The Uniburger is perfection without bacon. Next time I'll add bacon.

I reminded me of Shake Shack in the US or The Good Burger in Spain. It's perfect on every front. The meat, the bread, the ingredients, the sauce, I don't know where to start. 

It is without a doubt the best burger in Montreal, hands down.",5

5552,"I've found my new favorite steakhouse in Vegas!  

I made reservations way in advance for a friend's bachelorette party.  We came on a Saturday night at 7:30pm, and were seated pretty quickly.  Our servers were awesome!  Everyone was super nice!  I had bought a round of shots for the table, and our server came back with a 2nd round on him!  

All of us ordered some form of steak, and we thoroughly enjoyed every last bite.  I topped my fillet with foie gras and it was heaven!  I'm still very upset that CA banned it!  We ordered sides to share: creamed spinahc, parmesan truffle fries, mac & cheese, mushroom pot pie and the special trio of mac & cheese.  Oh, and I can't forget about their bread!  It was topped with melted blue cheese, and we ate it all!  Either we're a bunch of pigs or all the food was delicious because there was nothing left.

Another reason we loved the restaurant was the music.  The DJ was spinning hip hop and he had us dancing in our seats.  Even the table next to us was having a great time and danced as they got up to walk around!  It does get pretty loud in the restaurant, so don't go there expecting to have a quiet, romantic dinner. 

The only one bad thing I could even think of for STK was the single stall for the bathrooms.  Not very convenient.  But everything else was superb!",5

My wife has recently gotten a cut from her as well.  She does an outstanding job and are always pleased with the results.

5560,"GUAU is excellent! I've tried several groomers before finding GUAU, including Petsmart and some asian groomers in the Markham area but none of them come close to GUAU's service and facilities. Here are the reasons we love GUAU and why my furbaby Rikku is a regular client there:

1. One to one attention with your pet. Family run business with Lupita as the groomer, ensures your pet is well taken care of.
2. Lupita the groomer really listens to how you want your pet styled, and she gives advice and ideas along the way. No surprises when you pick up your pet, both husband and wife are very courteous and professional.
3. One of the best grooming facilities I've seen. Clean, modern, spacious. Even has a large dog bed and cushions for your pet to relax when waiting for a pick up, it really does feel like a doggie spa!

Thank-You GUAU from Rikku and family :)",5

Their beer has a nice range of light and satisfying to dark and delicious. And we had the nachos and they were awesome! 

Plus the decor is just so cool I end up just looking around for too long it's very cute cool..that is a think look it up, Cute cool and then there's a picture of Sugar Creeks tap room. For real. The vibe the beer, the everything. Go here. It's perfect. It's five stars. It's not noticed by enough people. So just go love on it for me since I live 30 minutes away and can't get there every day.

Are waitress was so incredible sweet (Mimi), very attentive & cheered up me & my partner after a bit of an upsetting event at another place. I would come back just for the great service alone.   

I had the veggie pizza on gluten free crust without cheese. One of my favourite things about this place was they don't charge to swap out toppings. I have a very restricting diet so this was great for me. They added extra sauce & jalape√±o & roasted garlic for no extra charge! The pizza was delicious! The sauce on it was amazing! Everything was cooked perfectly, the toppings were fresh. The pizza was a good size. My very hungry partner & I split this pizza. It was a good portion for the two of us! This pizza was $21. Normally I would think this was a little bit of a steep price but the quality of the pizza made it 100% worth it. 

The atmosphere was nice, they played kinda top 40 music, had oodles of T.Vs with sports one. It was very clean & organized. I liked it. 

I would say if you're in the area or feel like some really yummy pizza to check this place out. I hope I have time on this trip to go back!",5

5583,"Only reason we decided to eat brunch here instead of the Tupelo honey cafe across the street is because of the 2 hour wait at Tupelo. My advice: wait the two hours or simply skip brunch, either option would be better than the liberty. First of all, the service was awful. I would have liked to order a coffee, or an order of the biscuits for the table, but our server never gave us the opportunity. When our food finally arrived it was another disappointment. Half of the food was cold and my ""breakfast sandwich"" was so saturated in grease It was inedible. 10/10 would NOT recommend and will never be returning.",1
5584,"Oregano's is an amazing place for being a chain. Pizza is good, I get the thin crust. The Picasso salad is beyond amazing and big enough for two people.

I order takeout and you have to call early as they have takeout windows that can be an hour or after you order.",5
5585,"I recently attended the CES conference and was excited to find myself in the same hotel as Chica. I am admittedly a fan of Chef Lorena Garcia, so this restaurant was already on my bucket list to try since the opening last year.

So of course my first order of business before any conference-related activities was a solo brunch. They seated me quickly even though it was pretty busy already. I was quickly offered the chance to order a drink by the awesome Adrienne, and went with a nice classic mimosa. The menu is very simple, just two pages, but I asked for some suggestions from the staff before ordering. Adrienne brought me the guacamole appetizer, with an assortment of accoutrements - tortilla chips, plantain chips, and mini arepas in different flavors. The guacamole was delicious, and I really loved the pairing with the plantain chips. The arepas were excellent, and I enjoyed their flavors so much I didn't bother dipping them in the guacamole.

I also ordered the Grilled Peruvian Octopus, which did not disappoint at all. It was perfectly cooked, amazing flavor from both the octopus and the shishito peppers, and the crispy quinoa offered a nice light crunch. Absolutely recommend this appetizer!

For the main course, I settled on the Chica Burger, which Adrienne and manager Michael recommended to me when I couldn't decide. I had my heart set on tacos, but I'm glad I went with their suggestion. This burger is outstanding. Perfectly cooked to my preferred ""pink in the middle,"" with a super flavorful meat blend, and the kick of the Chica sauce was nice as well. It's topped with bacon, jalapeno jack cheese, avocado, crispy fried onions, lettuce, and tomato. Definitely a two-hander, and definitely recommend.

I didn't stop there. I wanted one more drink, and the bartender, Freddy, served up a margarita called ""Some Like it Hot."" It's made with their house-made papaya habanero jam, lime juice, and Espolon Reposado tequila. It has quite the quick, and I'm told that the spice level can vary based on the batch of jam, but if you like spicy you'll love this.

Lastly, I dabbled in some dessert! The pastry chef at Chica recently won Pastry Chef of the Year in Las Vegas (http://www.eatinglv.com/2017/12/pastry-chef-year-sara-steele-chica/) so of course I had to try some dessert. Her Tres Leches Dulce de Leche cake is absolutely incredible. I would come back over and over just for that. 

I can not sing the praises of this place any more than this! If you're visiting Vegas and you want to eat somewhere where the food is delicious, the staff is wonderful, and the atmosphere is great, head over to Chica.",5

Almost as soon as I got out of my car Louis started bothering me about using synthetic oil, which is a $34 upgrade.  When I told him I don't use synthetic oil in my 2005 Pruis he looked at me in horror.  He then led me to the office where he looked up the specs on my car.  He pointed out on the monitor where it called for 5w30 grade oil, API energy conserving.  Pretty much every oil produced is API energy conserving.  He flat out lied to me and said that API energy conserving meant full synthetic oil.  I told him it doesn't and he shut up after that.  This place is crooked and running scams.  I would never come here again.  I wouldn't be surprised if they used cheaper oil than the semi-synthetic I paid for since I saw him pour oil out of a large plastic jug.  Avoid these con-artists!!!",1
5587,What is not to LOVE about Flo's.  I haven't eaten here in years and it was just as great as I remembered.   I am from New Orleans and their shrimp rivals the fresh gulf shrimp that I grew up on.  I had the seafood soup and it was delicious and full of shrimp and scallops.   My meal was only $11.00 and I have leftovers for tomorrow night.   The hot and sour soup was also amazing and I hear their beef and noodle soup is delicious.   I am here for a month and will be eating here a lot.   I can't even make dinner at home for less than that.,5
5588,"I ate here a couple of times recently.   On both occasions I was acknowledged and seated quickly.  The menu was filled with other than usual fare for breakfast.  

The service was very prompt.  The food was prepared and presented quickly. The flavor
Of both meals orders was very tasty.  

My only feedback was I was not asked what type of bread I wanted or if I did or didn't want home fries 


I will definitely eat there again.",5
5589,"The worst McDonald's in the world.

Pulled up to the drive thru. No one at the first window. Pulled up behind a car at the second window and someone from the first window sticks his head out and shouts, ""First window please."" I said well no one was there. He said, ""I've been here this whole time"" and proceeded to argue with me about how he never left the window.

Didn't even bother talking to the manager because she was laughing at the way he talked to me.

Apparently they hire from the streets because this dimwit had no sense of customer service or communication. If I could give negative stars I would.",1
5594,Why does all that crazy stuff happen in Vegas? Fat Tuesday.,5
5595,"If the owner was so concerned with the work of his employees, he would've taken a look at my hair n refunded my $$$ instead of just firing the employee! I mean, I can't believe that he couldn't care that HIS employee fucked up my hair big time, and doesn't want to make it right!!! SMH",1
5599,Worse service ever! I went in for an oil change and a car wash. The technician told me that my  wiper's were in good condition on my driver side there is no wiper on there I need to replace the blade but in good condition really?... As I was getting my car from the car wash I noticed that there were marks on my bumper as if the car had been backed into something when I addressed it to the attendant he was in no assistant to help me to take care of the issue. I will never return to this location and most likely I will not go to any other locations as well. If you provide this type of customer service to people at one location it's a possibility all of them are like.,1

5602,"What a great local coffee shop! I love the homey feel of the place.. I came in on Monday morning on my way in to work, around 6ish and ordered a soy latte, then decided on some instant oatmeal. The woman who helped me was wonderful! I've been helped by her before.. She offered to make my oatmeal for me! Offered suggestions on which one to get. I also asked for honey for my coffee, again, she offered for me to add that in first so it would be mixed in with the coffee! I left feeling so good! My warm oatmeal in hand, and sipping on my great cup of joe! All made with love..",5
5605,"The best! Never had such a steak. A real event! Live Country music, reasonable pricing and the great view over Phoenix, AZ.",5
5607,"Oh Wicked Spoon! You've done it. THIS is how a buffet should be! Whether you want delicious poke, seafood grill station, frog legs, crab legs,bone marrow,  and more... wicked spoon does it right! Do NOT skip the seafood grill area (think omelet bar with seafood).  I loved everything I tried! We were driving through town and stopped for the night. I had three kids with me and we felt comfortable at the restaurant (as comfortable as one can feel with three kids on the strip in Vegas) 
It's a bit pricey (nearly $60 for weekend dinner) but I would pay it again and again! I will most definitely be back!",5
5608,"We Love the Applebees. So when we were in the area, went here, and had a really graat time and great food. Every time we dine in, we are treated with fast friendly service!  We recommend Applebees to anyone looking for a really good meal for an affordable price in a friendly atmosphere!",5
5609,"We've been going to this restaurant for about 2 years now. As a little background story, it is family owned and operated. The family immigrated to the US but first spent some time in Vietnam, thus the Vietnamese dished on the menu in addition to the Chinese. 

The place is indeed a bit antiquated in decor but it really makes up for it in food-flavor. The best way to enjoy this place is to go there with a few people and eat the food family-style. Sometimes you get to sit in the big booth table with the lazy-Susan. The last time I was there, I sat with a group of 7 people and each person ordered a different dish. 

My favorites are the House-Chicken which is a lightly battered and fried, and then they pour a light sweet-soy type sauce over it. The hot and sour soup is also very tasty. You can order it extra spicy if you want. It has all kinds of veggies, and shrimp, pork and tofu as well. Another good choice is the fried rice they make: pork or house fried rice are quite delicious. Oh and I almost forgot the walnut shrimp. OMG! DELICIOUS!!!!!!! My pregnant sister can't have enough of that.

The servers sometimes make fruit drinks that they hand out with crushed ice. I'm not sure if we get those because they know us or just because. We usually have water to drink so I can't comment on soda-pricing. 

The waiters/waitresses have accents because they were not born in the US. Some people should just get over that. 

I've been telling other friends about this place and I'll expect to go there again in the next few weeks.",5
5611,"Super understanding and helpful with our seriously anti-haircut two year old!  They did a great job even though he screamed and we had to wrestle him down :)
Well worth the money.",5
5616,"The owners (Atif and his Sister) are very personable and very knowledgeable about nutrition.  Their smoothies are the best nutritional smoothies I've ever had.  They don't load them up with sugar and they taste wonderful!   I tried most of the smoothies and I love them all.  Also, they have other nutritional items and supplements for purchase.  I highly recommend them!",5
5619,"The best yellow curry we have ever had!! Their Tom Kah Soup is amazing as well!! We loved everything! 

Location isn't the best, and it's off the strip. But the food is really, really good. 

Better than we've have in Vancouver, BC and we have good food in Vancouver!!!",5
5620,this place is a joke... I came in and ordered 2 smoothies and they made me wait 25 minutes for 2 drinks... they gave us a straw that had sticky substance on it... WTF. it was expensive for no reason and the smoothies weren't even tasty. NEVER COMING BACK.,1
5621,"I cannot even tell you how good this place was.
Great food. Fantastic decor. Wonderful service.",5
5624,"Truly a wonderful dining experience. The atmosphere is warm, quaint and inviting. The owners, Santino and Carmela Corso, and the entire crew go out of their way to make dining in their restaurant as though you're family in their home. The flavors and dishes are truly Sicilian as the Corso's are from Palermo! I've dined at Trattoria Italia many times and I've never been disappointed. The display case filled with authentic Italian sweets should not be overlooked. Don't miss this gem on Eastern Ave in Henderson. Your palate will thank you! Buon appetito!",5
5625,Monta is amazing. Not only are the noodles killer but I love the idea of a tiny little restaurant that really only does a handful of items. You won't find desserts or even much for appetizers here. But what they do they do to perfection. Every couple of weeks I NEED my miso ramen fix. I plan on moving next year and I know Monta is one place I will miss.,5
5626,"The Legacy Cafe and Lounge was one of the best, most cozy hookah bars I have been to. The first day I came with some friends and got seated immediately and was greeted by a wonderful waitress, whom explained to us the menu and more options that were not listed.

  In addition to hookah this lounge also offers a variety of food and hand made drinks. Both which I ordered and was extremely surprised! Most lounges have some cold stored food but this lounge made it all fresh.  I would highly recommend the cafe diablo. 

  Now to the hookah, we got two different ones, a blackberry peach and mint one along with a strawberry lemon one. Both were great and done traditional style. You are given a brand new house along with a full set of coals to light yourself. 

In total this was a great experience, with friendly staff and excellent food and hookah this place is a must stop when coming to Cleveland.",5
5627,These guys were great. Antonio was very understanding of my situation and worked with me to provide an excellent service for an affordable price. He also addressed all my concerns and the carpets look great. 5/5 would call upon them again.,5

5631,"The Cheesecake Factory never fails to let me down. I went came here the other night after a long day, so excited for the food. We were seated right away and had the best waiter, I wish I could have gotten his name. He was so friendly and diligent with refills. 

I love the Skinnylicious menu and all the options it has. It has a great variety with saving those extra calories for the cheesecake! I got the skinnylicous burger that came with a garden salad. I was very impressed with how quickly the food came out, being it was around 6:30 in the evening. The burger tasted very fresh and was cooked perfectly. The salad was very good. Whatever skinnylicious dressing they use, I wish I had a bottle of it at home! So good! The Cheesecake menu never fails to let me down. I always have to narrow down my picks. I went with the Reese's cheesecake. Amazing. Such a great way to indulge.

I would come back again, for sure!",5
5632,"This is our third time using mighty movers and it was flawless everytime! Moving is so stressful and they made everything so much easier. They were on time, very professional, and handled all our stuff with care. What I love most about them is that they are an HONEST and RELIABLE company. Seriously. I remember before we found them, how sketchy other companies were with all their hidden fees and taking their time moving things to try and make you spend more. Mighty movers isn't like that. They value heir customers and treat them like family! RECOMMEND 100% :)",5

The DJ was also awesome and kept the party going and our guests didn't want to leave!! I would highly recommend this venue to any bride!!,5
5635,"Excellent food, great service. Menu has classics and some creative choices including vegetarian. Will definitely be back.",5
5636,I've read a few reviews that had me worried. They said the place had been slipping was not as good as it used to be. I'm happy to report that we went last night and everything was amazing as always.,5

5640,"AWESOME place! I had the chicken shawarma and it was amazing! The owner is very nice. Have the house spicy sauce it's much better than sriracha. Also they make special shawarmas which I did not see on the menu, they add fries to it, you will need to ask. I will definitely go back.",5

5646,"Can i say.. This is my go to place for Korean BBQ! 

I've passed this place a few times when I used to work in the area, but I never really paid attention. It's been years and this was when it was still M sushi. I was greeted by Mr. Lee and his wife and right away, I knew I was going to love the place. Mr Lee is so kind and you can really tell he cares about his customers. He cared enough to get to know me and even if it was small talk, It made my day. His wife immediately distributed my soup while i waited for my boyfriend. I saw other yelpers say that the food was going to take longer because it is a husband and wife team , so I automatically ordered. It took less than 10 minutes for my food and they even offered us complimentary noodles! what place offers you authentic and free food? It was just the two of us so the couple offered us some privacy. Mr Lee would check on us from time to time and encouraged to eat as much as we can. Not many places even care enough to see if you're happy with the meal that was given to you. We left knowing that we'll be back soon. Mr Lee, if you read this.. Keep up the great work from you and your wife!",5
5653,"Boss wanted to eat Korean food and this place just happened to be near our work.
I was sooooo ecstatic when he said he wanted to eat Korean food because Korean food is Bomb and the Northside of vegas was def missing this. 
This place seemed new and was very clean. Had most of the fixings- bean sprouts, cucumber kim chi, regular kim chi, etc, but more limited selection than I am used to. 
We ordered:
1) Kalbi and Meat Jun Combo- rice and salad (2 peice of meat jun and 1 kalbi)
-meat jun: just like in Hawaii. Super juicy and the right amount of sweetness
2) Kalbi platter- 3 pieces of kalbi
- kalbi was tender and seasoned great
3) Hot pot Bi BIM BOP
-large portion: heavy rice and veggies
4) Spicy pork plater- rice and salad combo (BOMB BOMB BOMB- a must get)- perfectly seasoned and tasty
- portion sizes were on the smaller side esp the meat jun and kalbi platter
The reason I will be back is because of the Meat jun!!!!- something that has been hard to find and tastes just like how it does back in Hawaii.
Think I found my new fav korean place on the North Eastside :)",5
5654,"I heart this place! Who doesn't love pastries, sandwiches and desserts? One thing that stands out to me is how big everything is. Now saying that, I feel the prices are a little high, but again everything is larger in size (my opinion) and everything is homemade.

The Black Friday sandwich is delicious. The cranberry chutney and brie just oozes out the side of the warm pressed sandwich (I painted a good picture, right?) 
I love the tea and organic coffee here. This is a perfect spot for breakfast or lunch. Usually on the weekends or early morning during prime times there will be a line. 
I haven't had any desserts yet, but they look amazing. 
I look forward to the Dilworth location opening! I must try the homemade pop-tarts and fig and brie sandwich.",5
5655,My new local take out spot with many amazing dishes. My fav is the Norling fried pork.,5
5658,"SO went today and took my soon to be 5 year old. Went from 11am to 4pm. First off you have to understand this review is when some schools are still in session and a Tuesday after a holiday so crowds were small. Because of this we had a great time. This is a great place for kids of all ages and adults. Now I understand why some people get upset and write reviews they do but more often than not its not the parks fault and if they just plan ahead theyll be fine. Heres some advice. First off invest in some non slip water shoes. Itll make your feet feel great walking all over the hot pavement. You can also just wear flip flops and leave them where ever you go but its kinda of a hassle. I even saw people take them with them on rides but that seemed silly. I doubt anyone is going to steal your 5 year old, wrong size, ugly thongs like mine are. Second people complain its expensive. It was $5 for a snow cone, $12 for a double cheesburger basket meal and so on. Not quite disneyland prices and not quite Raising Canes either. Lets solve this. Take a cooler, pack a lunch, they will let you reenter. Turn on your car AC and relax in the car and have lunch. I did, we thought it was a nice break. Entrance fee. Too much people said. Costco, $27 tickets. Go between now and May 31 and upgrade to a Season Pass @ the park. Get a gold one for just $35 bucks more. Includes free parking (saves you $8 a trip) 99 cent drink refills, and a bunch of great stuff you can find on their website. People complained about the leadership there. Yeah the kids are young and if you get out of line Im sure there will be adults not real happy that someone half their age is telling them what to do. You know how many kids are in  their water? Tons.They are watching everyone with very good reason. They have rules for a reason. Not just so you can feel butt hurt about being scolded by an 18 year old.  Also there are a ton of places to find shade and put your stuff. You can leave it at your chair or rent a locker (again buy a pass and save). These are not requirements. You dont have to spend the extra $$$. But its there if you want to. I didnt take my 15 month old and wife today but will next time. There is even tons to do for them. Now remember I went on a Tuesday in May. If you go on a Saturday during peak time expect peak crowds. We walked on to every slide today, But I am not foolish enough to think that is the norm. Have fun and play safe!",5
5660,This place is ridiculously good. I had the short ribs and the chicken katsu and both were fantastic. Best lunch I've had in a long time,5
5662,"I do not recommend coming here. Although it is conveniently located in Oakland, you will get better service elsewhere. The staff is exceptionally unfriendly, ignored me when I asked questions, and there were barely any price tags on the products. Young's Oriental Grocery Store in Squirrel Hill is much better, has nicer staff, and has staple products.",1
5665,"This review is for the BCBG at Town Square. Yep! It's another dud of a store for customer service! I found a top and a bag I really liked, ready to purchase them but the associates were too busy in their conversation to get me another size. I left the fitting room twice to go get my own sizes as they stood there watching me and continuing their conversation. Regarding the handbag I liked, it was all scuffed up so I asked them to grab me another one. They said it was the only one. Ok, no problem I don't want to purchase the scuffed one, but on my way out there was another one right by the window! Maybe if they weren't so busy talking to each other about their car insurance they would know their merchandise better. Ughh... I'll just buy it at Saks so they get the sale instead of these underachievers....",1
5666,"This is the second time I've had the pleasure of eating here, and a pleasure it is! The big Bloody Mary is a meal in itself, and very tasty! The first time I was here I had the Bangers and Mash, and my tummy was in heaven! Great texture and flavor in the sausage, yum.
On this most recent trip, I had the mini cheeseburger appetizer as I wasn't super hungry, and it was perfect. So often, sliders are dry and puckish, but these were incredible! Perfectly grilled to a nice juicy medium, the generously sized  and delicious patty filled the tender brioche bun and was smothered in cheese and a crisscross of bacon! Yum!
They also do a great job with their cocktails. My friend is picky about her greyhound, she likes just a splash of grapefruit juice, and the bar got it right every time.
Our server, Afro, was beyond excellent! He made good suggestions, knowing we weren't starving, and was a delight. I would request his table again for sure! Love Gordon Ramsay and love the Pub & Grill!",5
5667,Great ribs and chicken plate. Large serving and well made. Will come back over and over. Cheap price for portions.,5
5668,"(DISCLAIMER: I WOULD GIVE A 4.5 IF I COULD) 

Falls Ice Cream is located in a quaint, set back little town in Downtown Olmsted Falls. There is parking everywhere, with signs telling where it is. The ice cream shop is set back in the ""village"", and it is not visible from Columbia. However, you will recognize and know the ""village"" if you look at one picture of Falls Ice Cream's storefront. You can easily access the shop from 480 and 71, with about a 8 minute drive from the highway to the shop from both. We got the non-dairy cookies and cream, and the non-dairy mint chocolate chip. They are amazing and the creamiest vegan ice cream I have ever had. Most vegan ice cream tastes like flavored ice, this did not! Sadly, we sampled some of the sorbets, and they were freezer burnt. I know that they just cannot sell enough of it, but if it was fresh, it would have been good. There are plenty of places to sit; tables at Falls, steps and porches, park benches, and even a large gazebo a minute's walk away! If you bring children who are obsessed with trains, there is a non-running two car train in the back to look at by the gazebo! The only downside to Falls is they way you get your ice cream scooped. Everybody crowds into the place, and they serve whoever seems the most determined to get served. You have to stomp your foot down and tell them you are ready so you are not waiting to order for hours. Some kind of system to the ordering (maybe deli tickets?) would be nice! Also, they are definitely understaffed, they usually have about 3 people working, when they should have at least 4, maybe 5. Also, they have plenty of toppings and syrups, but they are not on display. If you would like any on your ice cream (1 free, each one after for a small fee), just ask and see if they have it, because they may. I love the atmosphere there, but they definitely may need to move to another unit if the serving process becomes more of a problem.",5
5669,"I was so grateful that they had a lash professional here, after many attempts at other locations I could not get a appointment on a Friday.

He's extremely professional, has a great demeanor & delivers the content in a clear-to-understand manner.  He's also fantastic with kids (he does a kids handgun safety course, as well as other adult handgun classes).
In his home, it's a more intimate environment as he limits headcount. This allows for more absorption of the class content and important safety guidelines. Live fire after class is right in his backyard.
His flexibility, cost and delivery all make Michael a great choice for your CC Training.",5

She really did an amazing job and took less time than most hairdresser take to do blow out my hair.   She understood what I wanted from the pictures I showed, which surprisingly most hairdresser don't. 

All around great blow dry bar :)",5

5684,"I'll just begin by saying that I love this place. I've been there a couple of time, always on Wednesday because they have their Martini Mercredi deal; 6$ instead of 9$ for their delicious martini. The bartender, Stefano, is super nice and can make you some tasty martini according to your taste. Really, their martini are amazing! :)

I never had any food except for their bottle cap jalape√±o which consist of slice of jalape√±o fried served with a ranch sauce, it's pretty epic.

Every time I went, it was full which affected the wait time, it was sometime long but that's okay when you're in good company. Also, it's quite small but it's never feels too crowded and the decor is nice.

Overall it's an amazing pub that I'll keep on going to when I want martini!",5
5688,I love Page's!  It's a Pittsburgh staple that gives the summer months a sweeter taste!  I went to Page's last week and it was delicious as always!  This time I thought to treat my puppy to a small cup of vanilla ice cream.  I asked the lady at the counter for a small to-go cup of vanilla ice cream for my puppy!  When I got home and went to give my dog the cup I saw a milkbone topper that she had placed in his ice cream!  It was a perfect added touch that will keep us coming back!  Thank you!,5
5690,"To the rude woman, Patricia Z.,  with the broken leg who wrote a horrible review today : I saw you in there today, and you acted like a rude idiot . I have been a regular for 4 years here. Kevin did apologize , you were just too busy running your mouth off! ""Speak f$&#%ing English ""- racist much ? Are you kidding me ? They can speak whatever language they want in there , who do you think you are ? And you were angry about your broken leg and they had no accommodations for you ? Did you call ahead , did you let them know ? You were already upset about your broken leg and whatever else is wrong in your pathetic little life so you found it easy to pick on someone you feel is inferior to you. I almost said something to you today, but my regular manicurist asked me not to. She was defending you , then . You were rude, loud, and ridiculous today. I'm GLAD you won't return , then my regular appointments won't be disturbed by you and your entitled  attitude. You were an embarrassment to all of us older Anglo ladies today. Grow up ! And clean up your language on here! You sound even tackier then you look when you use curse words all over the place. And watch your spelling and grammar , too . Don't criticize people about not speaking English when you yourself cannot write properly !  Kevin, Jennie , and all the staff of Anthem Nails are very good people. You don't deserve an appointment there!",5
5691,"Gordon Ramsay Steak is located in the middle of the restaurant; when you walk in from the main doors/valet, walk towards the bridge and you will see bright red letters.

We made reservations for 2 at 6:30pm on Friday, May 11th, which was opening night.

After walking through the red tunnel and past the wine case, you can't be seated at a bad seat in the house.  It's not a huge restaurant, as it holds about 200 people, but it's comfortable.

The waiter comes out with an iPad with all of the drinks and wine list.

We ordered:
*Strawberry Martini
Bombay Sapphire, Strawberries and (something else).
- Probably the smoothest martini I have ever had!  I will be ordering all of my martini's with Bombay from now on.
*Pimm's Cup
Pimm's with lots of fruit.
- Very yummy and smooth.

We knew right away what we wanted for our main course & dessert, after watching Gordon Ramsay for years, but we weren't sure what we wanted as an appetizer or side dish.  We asked our waiter, Freddie (who was EXCELLENT!!) and he recommended the Foie Gras.

Appetizer:
*Foie Gras
Strawberry jam, homemade biscuits, bacon bits and foie gras.
- This was actually my first time having Foie Gras and OMG!  It was DELICIOUS with all of the flavors combined.  Amazing!

Before we placed our order for the main course, Freddie came out with a meat cart with all of the cuts of meat so we could see and make the best choice!

Main Course:
*Beef Wellington for 2
Beef in puff pastry with potato puree, carrots and potatoes.
- Cooked Medium/Rare and had great flavor!! 

Side Dish:
*Fingerling Potatoes w/ Parmesan and Truffles
- Um, no other description needed.  Sides are enough to share and are holy cow delicious!  The potatoes were seasoned to perfection.  I would order over and over again!

Dessert:
*Sticky Toffee Pudding w/ Brown Butter Ice Cream
-I FUCKING DIED AND WENT TO HEAVEN!!!!!!!
It's not pudding like we think, its a warm date cake/bread with warm brown sugar glaze poured over the top with some brown butter ice cream (cut in the shape of a stick of butter).
I'm not kidding- this was the best part of the dinner and I wanted like two more orders!  SO FREAKING GOOD!!!

By the end of the night, $225 for the total bill and we were out in about 1.5 hours.  I was worried that they might rush us on opening night, but not at all!  The service was perfection as we never wanted for anything.

I can't wait to go back and get that sticky toffee pudding!",5
5692,Great customer service with attention to detail and superior workmanship!  The location is perfect and the neighborhood has been in need of excellent tailor/seamstress services.

5693,"We can't express how delighted we are after great great dinner.  The food is fantastic taste,  fantastic quality.Great ambiance and good music.  Not like typical Indian music which even they don't listen back in India.  Atmosphere was like Toronto with Indian food.  It is must go place. 

We are visiting Toronto from US and we want something similar back home at Dallas.: -)

Me and wife are super foodie and we eat almost anyplace. Believe me,  for Indian food,  this is the place. We walked 30 mins in search for this place but it was worth coming here. 

Worth every penny and efforts!!  Must go !!!",5
5696,"Aside from the overly cooked chicken (which is safer than the other way around), I think this is a great place for lunch.  The avocado salad is wonderful.  The chicken is great once you put it in a tortilla and add salsa (since its dry otherwise).  I think for the buck, this place is wonderful.  There is variety and the food seems healthier than your typical fast food lunch joint.",5
5698,"Went to Shuseki for lunch on 1/3/11, as Monta was so packed, it was nearly a 45-minute wait. Wow, what a CHANGE for me.

It used to be a pretty tasty place, but after this last visit, they -have- to improve ALOT for me to return. The place was decenly busy, but only one waitress for the entire place. Therefore, she was not very attentive.

The food was pretty disappointing, as well. I got their tonkotsu ramen, and I guess Monta has REALLY spolied me for the good stuff. The broth was weak, and flavorless, the 2 slices of chashu were unseasoned, boiled bits of nothing.

My husband ordered the katsu curry set, and whar he got was just gross and unacceptable. The curry sauce seemed from a pre-made boxed mix, and it was cold, and seperating from itself. I know that a boxed Japanese curry mix -can- be fantastic, if it's hot, and decently tended. It looked VERY unappetizing. The katsu was freshly made, tho and was decent. (so he said) 
The waitress seemed to avoid us, and never -once- asked how the food was. No matter, as we were running late and actually getting a fresh order just wasen't going to work that day.

They -have- to step up their game, or they will loose lots more customers who have so many great places to eat in Chinatown.",1
5699,"Terrible, terrible, terrible customer service if I could give this place a 0 star I would. Rebecca was rude from the beginning when checking into the hotel. The bartender ignored us, and when we finally got his attention he was mean, and seemed as if he didn't want to serve us. My friend asked what beers he had since a list or menu wasn't given. He responded, "" We have over 20 beers, I'm not going to list them all...what do you like?"" Also ate dinner at the restaurant in the hotel, and received horrible service there. Food took forever, and the server got my order wrong, and it seemed like she didn't want to serve us as well. This was the most terrible experience I have ever received at hotel. I never write reviews, but I felt as if I needed to tell my experience. From the bar to the restaurant as a server I've learned from this experience, and will never treat my guest the way. The manager was good to us, but it wasn't enough to make me go back.",1

5701,"I love this brunch place!!! All the food was really delicious, the service is so friendly and the overall feel of the place just screams ""fun""!! We went on a Saturday morning around 11, and we were seated promptly. There was a DJ playing, and the music selection was great! We immediately ordered the bloody mary (I'm usually not a huge fan of bloody Mary's, however the make your own bloody mary bar seemed too good to pass up). I got the cilantro vodka and medium spicy (definitely spicy enough - would not be able to have any more spice to it). The bar had such a great selection - bacon, salami, pickled celery, asparagus, mango, eggs, and oysters. The pickled eggs were surprisingly delicious - it was the first time I had tried it. 

For food, everything we ordered was great. There were a bit too many potatoes in the huevos ranchero hash, but that's a personal issue. I'm not the biggest fan of potatoes. It was flavorful and there was plentiful. 

The service was excellent! Our waiter was extremely friendly, great with food recommendations and enjoyable small talk! I really enjoyed my experience here! Will definitely be back :)",5
5702,"Well, I wasn't expecting much from this place and I was right to. I had the 'FusiaDog', basically a cheap hot dog straight out of the Maple Leaf package with some ""kimchi"" (just some shredded cabbage and carrots, hardly kimchi by any standard) on top. The whole experience cost over 7 bucks. Total rip off. Save your money and go to a hot dog vendor on the street, at least you can get a sausage for under 4 bucks.

I don't see this place lasting long. I would of paid at best 3 bucks for the FusiaDog. I could see this whole idea working if it was just a street cart and meals went for under 5 bucks but to expect people to pay north of 7 dollars for a cheap, crappy hot dog is nuts. I understand that the area is high rent, but this place is going to offer a hell of a lot more if they want to stay afloat.

In short, go to any number of the street vendors in the area if you want a hot dog.",1
5703,"I went here on a first date, I was not that excited about my date except for that he knew of this superb little spot. 

Seating is limited but I love smaller spaces, they block out yacker types who cannot sit down in peace and enjoy sans cell phones. 

If it is warm out the back patio is lovely, but inside looks nice as well. The whole menu looks fab from lunch to dinner but I had the pan seared pork chop with polenta and kale.

Make reservations!

Lovely just mouth watering perflect marriage of flavors, I ate the left over as soon as I got home lovely. 

Its BYOB which is a plus :) 

The server was attentive and paced things well, which was good because I had to keep the conversation going with my date. 

I must miss France because a little taste of the food here brought it all flooding back. 

Kudos to my date for agreeing with me that the third hunger games book stunk and knowing of this place. He was not my match but the food here made up for it.",5

5709,"A-MA-ZING!! A friend of mine had been here and told us about the Chef (Steve Young), so we figured we'd give it a shot. So glad we did! Definitely made it to my list of favorite restaurants in Las Vegas!  Wagyu beef is insanely tender and prepare so deliciously! I had a soup with cauliflower three ways that was so tasty! I don't even really care for cauliflower and I loved this soup! We had oysters, shrimp, tartare... we just kept ordering food and it just kept getting better! Seriously, everything was prepared so deliciously! We mentioned to the waiter that we were there because we heard about the chef and the chef even came out to personally say hello to us and ask our meal was. He even took a photo with us. Amazing service and even more amazing food!!",5
5710,I have enjoyed this airport on more than occasion. I primarily fly Southwest out of Terminal 4. They are always working on improving the airport and amenities. I have always found it to be clean and organized. The staff is helpful as well. Automobile traffic has increased tremendously in the pick-up and drop-off areas but I guess that's just a sign that our economy is doing well. I enjoying flying from Phoenix Sky Harbor.,5
5711,"Oh my WOW! 

My friend and I dropped by to check out the new wing at the Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall yesterday, and lemme tell ya, its a big 10 in my book. It is beautifully! I thought for sure security was going to kick me out for looking a bit less than perfect, as everything and everyone else looked amazing. 

There are three new restaurants that have opened. Modern Steak (Sam Fox ) and Mercella's(sp) and Fred's (inside Barney New York). I have yet to dine in any of them, but I will be sure to review accordingly when I do. 

As for the shopping part, Forever 21 is huge, we needed one on this side of town for sure! There is also a True Religion, H&M, and a Christian Audiere there by Barney's. The outside of the mall looks spectacular as well. I guess Scottsdale is movin on up in the world, with a Barney's New York no doubt. Valet anywhere you need it, self parking is easy as well. A true mecca of shopping! :-) Now all I need is an abundance of money and all will be well. 

You must check it out.",5
5712,We went there for lunch for the first time and were pleasantly surprised. The fish was very fresh and just melted like butter. The rice was just right. My husband had the hamachi collar bone and stopped speaking . His face was full of joy. Miso soup delicious as well. Not cheap but great quality,5
5713,"Had the best experience. The person who helped me was Christopher. Very good people and excellent work. He made sure I knew exactly what was being performed on my car and advised me on some future issues. It's hard to find a new mechanic especially if you're from out of town, I see myself coming back here again and would definitely recommend this shop to everyone and anyone. I'll be back here again to get work done on my car.",5
5716,Beautiful tile and great customer service. You've got to love this place - they even remember your name months after you've been in. Thanks to Junior and the rest of the staff for always making it a great shopping experience !!,5
5717,Very friendly staff. A very beautiful nail salon and very good service. They are very sanitary and do amazing work.,5
5719,"Remember those pretzels that you usually buy at the mall? Well, imagine the taste of that pretzel with the fluffiness of a pancake with the crisp crust all in a waffle. I got a waffle with the speculoos ice cream, and that was to die for. It's a small shop, but it redefines what you look for in your waffles. My brother got the waffle with the cinnamon ice cream. The speculoos was sweeter whereas the cinnamon was more well balanced. I would have finished the whole thing, but I just finished dinner right before so I couldn't finish my waffle + ice cream or I would be sent into a sugary food coma. Both were amazingly delicious, so if you're a sweet lover like I am, you'll love these as well.",5

5721,"11/30/2015
I work right around the corner from here and for a quick lunch I will swing through the Drive through and I'm back at work in minutes...  What's that they say - ""you get what you pay for"" ... Well that's so true in the case of this Wendy's. I will drive 5 minutes out of my way to go to the Deer Valley location from now on. The last two times my spicy chicken wrap has been cold, and I mean, cold cold. Today we asked the girl if they were suppose to be hot- She said yes. Told her how the last two times they were cold, she said they would be hot. Well, they were cold. And so was my fries and so was my co-workers chili. Not to mention in the drive through window, had to reminder her to put cheese on the chili that she forgot and the side of ranch that she forgot. Then to get back to the office, I find, there are no straws, no napkins, and no spoon for the chili. If the girl at the window, wasn't in such a rush, to get back to the empty restaurant, maybe our order would have been correct. And you think you should get paid $15.00 an hour - I think not.",1
5722,"Awful experience.  1) they are overpriced and give zero discounts for multiple pets even when coming in during the same appointment.  They charged me for an office visit for each of my pets even though they were all in one room and got barely any attention individually.  The doctor was significantly late ever coming to the room and then had almost no answers to any of my questions.  My hour appointment turned into a four hour - all afternoon endeavor.  They wanted a follow up for the pets but again.... Wanted to charge a $40-50 visit fee for each dog for 1 follow up shot each.  To make matters worse, they flat lie.  I had my grandparents dogs with me to get shots.  I told them this.  They assured me that they did not report animals to the county for licensing.  We had just moved here and I didn't need that headache yet.  Low and behold, a couple months later I get a notice from the county for not having the dogs licensed and now owe a penalty fee.  I specifically asked if they report and they assured me they did not so I hadn't been in a big hurry.  If you report, be honest about it!  There is nothing I despise more in a company than dishonesty.",1

5726,"Well I came back to RC Willey after an exhaustive search for a couch.  I dealt with Kirk who was awesome.  Very helpful, not pushy, informative and let me sit on every couch in peace.  So I bought a new couch and love seat.   Thanks RC Willey and Kirk for being a super stars with the customer service, looking forward to sitting on the couch when it arrives Saturday.

*****update***** 
So they delivered the couches today and no doubt the mid rise I live in is a difficult spot to make deliveries. The elevator, while it can handle most things, bigger things like a couch sometimes have to go up or down the stairs. Houghton and his partner did a stellar job delivering the couches.  They called early to let me know they'd be here within the hour and they were!  By the time I headed down to let them in the maintenance guy had already let them in and the love seat was already being brought up.   Then, they grabbed the couch which had to be brought up the stairs and the guys handled it professionally and quickly.  Unfortunately I had no cash (I rarely carry cash anymore) to tip them but wrote them a tip check. Lol. Anyway, I can't say enough good things about the whole process. Great experience all the way around.",5

5728,"I've done my own eyebrows since I started grooming them, with the exception of 4 stylists before giving Shila a try. Everyone prior to Shila couldn't provide the results I wanted, even with step-by-step instructions. I heard about the horrible pain threading has, but I decided to give it a try anyway. Shila is excellent at her job (it gets a little tricky because of my scar causing my hair to grow a certain way!) I'm always satisfied when I leave and get complimented on how great my eyebrows look. 

Regarding the rumored pain, Shila's technique is extremely gentle. Plus, she trims all the right spots and gets every single hair that needs to be removed. I'm so busy with school and work that she has to start from scratch sometimes and I don't even need to give any directions. I'm a loyal patron for sure! I've seen one other stylist at this location, she does excellent work as well. My favorite is Shila though because her technique provides the least amount of pain.",5

5730,Awesome pizzas and salads are just as good. You can pretty much put whatever you want on either which is great. The concept is a bit confusing if you've never been but the people there are very friendly and patient and walk you through it. I've been back multiple times and it's always light and tasty. Definitely a great spot to grab a bite. Plus they have beer on draft which is always a plus.,5

5735,"If I could give this place negative stars I would.  Staying at the Marriott in Pittsburgh and ordered from here, based on a recommendation from the desk clerk.  I ordered a supreme steak gourmet hoagie without onions due to being allergic.  My food arrived within the promised 30 minutes.  Unfortunately, upon opening my sandwich, I found it full of onions. I called back and explained my order was incorrect.   The woman in the phone said  a new sandwich would be sent to me.  I meet the driver in the lobby a second time and he assures me my food was correct.  Wrong! This time they sent me a steak hoagie, not the supreme one I ordered.  My third call was to request my credit card be credited because,  I was fed up with trying to get food from this place. 
The manager was so disrespectful, referring to me as ""honey"".  He refused to refund my money because I wouldn't dig the sandwiches out of the garbage can and return them to his driver.  He expected me to get them out of the trash and go downstairs a third time. I have never been treated so poorly by an establishment. 
I worked in the restaurant business for over 20 years. This is not how you treat customers, especially when you don't deliver what is promised.",1

Ordered - 
Say No More - refreshing cocktail. You get light hints of honey in it. Absolutely stellar.
Devil in Red Dress - also tasted refreshing. Worth a try if you are a Gin lover.

Must go places I would say.",5
5744,"""Beautiful Views, Spacious, and Great music"". I'm rather picky when it comes to Nightclubs, but I seem to always have a good time here whenever we have our ""Girls Night Out"" and that is usually on a Thursday or Friday night so those days seem best. I do however recommend that you arrive early to get in because lines can get long, but the wait isn't that bad. The most we have waited in line is 3-4 minutes on a busy night, but Im speaking from the Guest List. I'm not sure how it works from the other end. I've been to this place more than any other Nightclub on the Las Vegas Strip, ""So, that's a A+ in my book!"" Plus the Promoter Izzy is really great!",5
5747,"Avoid this Burger King at all costs! I used to frequent this place often, but over the past two years it's become awful. I highly recommend going hungry should that be the only other option. The cheese is always dry, the chicken is always soggy, and the fries are freshly cold anytime of day. I've even had terrible breakfast sandwiches here, which should be a crime. It's not difficult to make a fast food experiences worse but the employees take the cake in that category.  Avoid if you value your stomach and have to have Burger King, try the one at Broadway and Priest, the quality is worth the trip.",1

5750,"On 16Mar18, I had my car hand washed at Full Circle.  My car has a key fob and they put my key into another vehicle, same make and model, and the other vehicle drove away.  I was told they had the information on the other vehicle and they would contact the owner and get my key back.  One of the workers had to give me a ride home to get a second key.  The next several days, through phone calls and personal contact with the manager Timothy, I was told the other vehicle was never located.  Timothy lied, telling me he was the owner of the business, I'm guessing in an effort to stop me from talking to the real owners.  I finally had to call the corporate office.  It took two weeks to rectify this issue!  At Full Circle's cost I had to go to a dealer and purchase another key, which took four hours out of my day.  

I understand that mistakes happen, but the way this issue was handled was 100% unacceptable.  I was not offered any compensation for gas or my time, and Timothy refused to give my money back for the wash.  This was the second time I have had an issue there with a key, and it will certainly be the last as I will no longer give them my business.",1

5755,"Have you ever had cheeseburger pizza? Probably. And I'm sure it was great. Now step your game up and get you a pizza burger. That's right. A cheeseburger wrapped inside pizza dough baked to perfection. I'm not sure what sorcery goes on in their kitchen to make the veggies still perfectly crisp and not at all soggy despite having been cooked in an oven underneath a blanket of pizza dough, but damn is it magical. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've never ordered anything from here that wasn't simply divine. I could legitimately live off of the healthy chicken bowl. And all of the praise for the amazing food is a moot point when you factor in how wonderful the entire family that owns this place is. It feels good gorging yourself on pizza burgers when you know you're supporting a really amazing family to continue doing what they're passionate about.",5

My sister and I were pretty stocked to go since it's part of our bucket list, we love traveling so this was a good way for us to bond. They send us instructions of what to do and when to send documents by. We sent our documents to the location in flushing so we can get our Visa it's been more than a month and we haven't received our documents, every time I called I get a different response or information. I asked to speak to a manager and there's still no point because she is as clueless as her employees. My trip is in 2 weeks and I have no idea if I'm going to get all the necessary document in time for my trip.

We got there early, ordered the premier cru margarita, a beer and guacamole and fell in love! Between the six of us we had the Korean fried chicken taco, beef short rib taco, lamb taco, oyster taco, duck taco, pork belly taco, street corn, pozole and gazpacho. We had the margaritas, Spanish red wine and beers.  I am Mexican and like rice and beans with my Mexican food.  Last night I did not miss them.  The food is all perfectly seasoned, a bit hot for one in our group, but otherwise just perfect. Service was excellent from the moment we walked in till we walked out. Chef Hinojosa has created my new favorite Mexican restaurant.  And not just because we are both from Texas where he obviously got his very fine early training.  What a wonderful addition to our Latino restaurants.",5

5760,"Fucking horrible,  being from both LA and NYC.  I think folks standards of food is way too low.  Like giving 5 stars to in and out burger.

This place is gross.  I ordered 3 things in an attempt to not go wrong.
#1 Chicken wings
#2 Chicken pad thai
#3 Mooshoo Shrimp 

ALL BAD!
The chicken wings are battered in bisquik,  WHY!?  what for?  I'm not saying not to season fried chicken but no asian joint makes wings that come out looking like fried oreos from a carnival.   

The chicken pad thai,  I hate when restaurants don't soak the noodles long enough so they come out undercooked.  The sauce used tasted like Mcdonlads BBQ sauce and they breaded the chicken.  So literally its like a rice based fettuccine with BBq sauce and chicken nuggets.
Instead of traditional sprouts it came with iceberg lettuce and carrots?  just WTF!

The moo shoo , comes in beef chicken or shrimp.  NO PORK which is traditionally what it should be was dripping wet with sauce and came with more sauce on the side.

We took two bites of everything and asked for the check.
I can't stand businesses who will ask you if you want a box to go but not ask you what's wrong if you choose to say no thanks with 80% full dishes.   So I really don't give a rats ass if they gave me service with a smile.  That smile is on auto pilot,  if they really cared, they'd ask me how come I'm wasting all this food.

I actually thought the decor was rather nice and being there was other patrons I thought ot myself how bad could this place be?   WRONG!  WRONG! WRONG!

There is a reason shitty places like these are not in china town, because they wouldn't last a day against real competition.   

Bottom line,  if you're in the mood for anything asian, get your butt to china town.  Otherwise you're better off getting pizza or chipotle across the street.   Holy hell this place was gross.",1

5763,"Great food, great service and the facility has never looked better! If you haven't been in lately, you will be pleasantly surprised.",5
5764,"This place is basically the definition of what you want from a local establishment. 

First, the product (in this case gelato and pastries) is both excellent and unique. Fried chicken and waffles gelato? Does that even make any sense? Who cares, it's awesome. There is a constant rotation of weird and classic flavors. You can tell the owners love what they do. 

Second, the service is always super friendly and engaging. We're happy to go just to interact. We probably stop in every month or so and they always remember my kids. They're just great. 

This place is a real gem. If you're looking for a case study on how to run a business, just watch this place. I can't say enough.",5

5766,"Stopped in this store for the first time last week.  There was a nice selection of jewelry in silver, brass, gold-filled, etc. so at different price points-something for every budget.  Some pieces were made by the owner, who is very nice and helpful by the way, and others by other local artists. I found a pretty, delicate pair of earrings designed by a jewelry designer from Montreal. 
The store is located in the plateau area and definitely worth a visit. Lots of other boutiques to poke around too.",5
5767,"What a dump!!!  Smells like a smoking room, lamp doesn't work, mildew in the shower. The one star is for the shampoo.",1
5770,Really great food. We had the salmon and a wedge salad. The blue cheese on the salad was amazing. The salmon was cooked perfect. Not a tv in sight which is big plus for us! Great music too!,5
5772,"What happened to this place? I guess coming in at 6pm on a Saturday and seeing it completely dead should be a sign. For starters, the food and drink prices seem ridiculously high from what I remember. The staff is alright, our waiter was pretty friendly this time around but with as slow as it was, it took way too long for our food to come out.

I went with a new item they had on the menu...Korean Steak Tacos. For $10, I expected a lot more. The tacos were small and had barely any meat on them, the tortillas were stale and I'm pretty sure the greens topping them were expired. My wife had the wedge salad and boneless wings which were both okay. They drench the wings in sauce so they are super soggy when they come out. About the only thing we liked were the pretzel sticks which I'm guessing are a frozen thing so not too hard to get right anyway.

The food and service might deserve 2-3 stars but the restaurant doesn't for letting a particular ""balloon man"" wander around. I posted a picture of the guy so if you see him, make sure to say no thanks on the balloon animals. I don't get mad easily and joke around quite a bit, but this dude was a complete d-bag. He was making inappropriate jokes, being rude and just acting like a complete jackass in front of my family, including my 4 year old who he was making the balloon for. Had I not been with family, there would have been a problem with the way this guy was acting. I won't be coming back to this particular TGI Friday's anytime soon, if ever, just because of him.",1
5773,"The bagels here are extremely fresh and soft. The cream cheese is always flavorful and the texture is perfect. Beware- they will sell out. Many times, I have come here past 11 and most of the bagels have been sold. If you want the full selection, come early or on a week day! It's definitely worth the trip.",5
5775,"I started coming here for crossfit, and I really like it!  Yes, I've been sore everyday since starting, but I know I'm getting a good workout. The people here are really nice. I've been going to the 9:30 am crossfit session, and so far it's ranged anywhere from 4-8 people in the class. It's almost like personal training in a group setting, so I really enjoy that. I bought a one month deal from the NPR auction, but I'll most likely continue coming here after that expires because I like it better than my current gym. And since the groups tend to be smaller, you feel a sense of accountability when you don't go. Currently, I've been going every other day because I've been so sore. But eventually I'd like to work that up to 4-5 times a week. It is a bit expensive, so it definitely makes you want to go more often to get your money's worth. I thoroughly enjoy this place and the trainers here.",5
5776,"What a complete disappointment. I ordered the potato soup, it was bland. Ordered the traditional Hawaiian lunch plate, it was lack luster. I would not waste my time or money again. 

The bread however was delicious.",1
5777,"One of the Best Pho restaurants in uptown Toronto!  Food is flavourful, with different varieties, portions are good, price is very fair.  Service is very good, very attentive. It's a must try!  A party of 5 including a kid, we ordered Bo La Lop, 2xLarge Pho, Tom Yum Pho, Ga Nuong Bun/For Vermicelli.  The soup bases are good, the meat is nice, has good texture.  You can choose dried or fresh rice noodles.  The food looks good we totally forgot to take any photos.  We fully enjoyed the food very much and cleared the table in no time.  There are much more food in the menu that is normally not found in most Vietnamese restaurants unless you go to the West end.  My kid who is a picky eater said she wants to come back!

The only negatives I found tonight were: it was a bit hot in the restaurant (hot day) and a bit noisy when they blended juices... otherwise, it's just superb.",5

Great job Nick's!",5
5779,"The food quantity to price at Halibut House makes this very very poor value.  Very very small fish portions!!!!! The chips are not chips in the classic sense.  They are processed somewhere else, frozen, then fried in the store.  Nothing special.  Coleslaw, nothing special.  Not in house tartar.  I think the very rapid expansion of this 'chain' is showing increasing problems in quality and attention. It doesn't really feel like a family run business.  Hate the d√©cor.  If anyone remembers H. Salt Fish and Chips,  I think Halibut House will disappear too.  We will stick with places like Harbord, John's, Kingsway (a little too snooty and pricey tho)  and a fav of ours in Shelburne Ont, Hyland Fish and chips rather than ever return here.  I think there is room for scaling up by good fish and chip businesses but not 18 stores in 15 years. Feels commoditized.  Again, fish portions are skimpy, chips are not good.",1
5780,"Numerous times the baggers have NOT bagged ALL OF MY ITEMS!!!! It's real irritating when I drive 20 minutes home to find out that my main ingredient to my dinner is MISSING!!!! What makes it more irritating is that when I go back to the store, the cashier was VERY RUDE and tells me that I NEED MY RECEIPT!! I just drove 20 minutes back in a rush so that I can make dinner for my family!! I complain and she rudely interrupts me mid rant and tells me to just go back to the butcher and get another one. So I go back there and they're now out of what I need!! Ugh!!!!!! I'm so irritated!!! My advice is to check your bags BEFORE you leave the store!!!!! On a good note though, the lady at the butcher shop was very very understanding and kind! She was able to get me what I needed!! Thank you Cindy!! I return to the check out to let them know that I got another package of hamburger and the Customer Service Manager, Bryson doesn't say a word to me, doesn't apologize for their mistake, nor does he say thank you when he hands me my receipt. Great customer service! *sarcasm*",1

The two gentlemen Joey & Oliver were very nice and helpful, I had many questions and they answered everything gladly for me. I accidentally locked myself out of my house in the middle of the day.

Really recommend any of their drinks, especially the dragonfruit tapioca and the coffee-esque one. Both were superb!  This place is underrated and I'll definitely be back.",5
5786,"So I read the reviews and as usual I don't pay too much attention to them because I like to make my own judgment on a place based on my experience so with that said I went in to the restaurant at 9:40 pm which is 20 minutes till close but they had over 12 employees working at what seemed full throttle which is typical for young folks trying to get off and out on a Friday night. I have to add that Chipotle is one of my favorite places to get food and having children and bills it's almost a treat to have being that for only me and my girlfriend it was 21 dollars. I got to the restaurant and there was a line. Usually a line for Chipotle but always moves fast I ordered 2 burritos, chicken for my girl and steak for me so as he was making my burrito I asked for half barbocoa and half steak he asked if I wanted double meat or just half and half and I said half and half. Well the barbocoa pan was full of meat so he gave me a tong full and the steak pan had less than a big spoon full literally 5 little pieces of steak and rather than get something fresh from what they were cooking behind him he passed my burrito off to the next stage of the burrito making phase and as i stood there looking at the 2 burritos with the meat on the rice my girls burrito had almost triple the meat mine had so rather than be a jerk and make a complaint I just asked for double meat which the guy from the next phase of the burrito making he grabbed a heaping cup full of meat. The little cups they usually put the salsa or other sides in and it was what the amount was for being a single meat burrito I asked him to go light on the hot salsa because let's face it that stuff can melt the paint off of a car if you tried. Lol but the guy put a whole ladle full. I just shook my head to which he didn't notice and started wrapping my burrito after placing the other ingredients I asked for in it. So final stage of the transaction of the burrito making production line the cash register guy asked if I wanted some chips or anything else. I love the lime salted chips and of course said yes. I didn't notice the size of the chips till I got home and to a great disappointment the chips were hardly filled to the bottom of the letters of the bag where it says Chipotle.  Which you get more if you buy a 1.49 bag from the store. So very disappointing and to have payed 21 dollars for food that was poorly put together and skimped on for chips and meat  which I had to pay double just to get what I should have gotten for the single meat price mind you, also the non existing bag of chip's. I will make sure they never get my hard earned money ever again. How could such an amazing chain become so non amazing over the last few years? For me I know that I won't be going back to this location or any of their locations which is terrible because of this experience and I truly hope my review reaches out and makes someone think twice before they go overpaying for poor food and poor service at Chipotle.

5792,"My Uber drive got lost 4 times, He couldn't even find me to pick me up... that should have been the first and last sign. should have cancelled right then... but I didn't. He took me to the air cargo area of the Toronto airport instead of the terminal. I told him that he was going the wrong way and he insisted on using the GPS. Once he finally turned around, he insisted on using his GPS again and missed the airport exit! He turned off the freeway looking for a way back and got lost again. He finally found another sign for the airport. This 29 minute ride turned into 55 minutes. Had he just followed the HUGE airport signs I would have made my flight. This mistake cost me a $200 flight change and a $157.07 hotel charge. Not to mention I was suppose to be at work this morning in Dallas. I use Uber all the time and I am usually very happy with the service. Very surprised that one of your drivers doesn't know how to get to a major airport or know how to read simple street signs.",1
5793,"We love the pizza at Barros. The restaurant is always clean which is a pretty big deal as well!! They are usually really quick with the order, although on a friday night when it is busy you might have to wait a little bit, but not too bad. I think the price is pretty good as well.",5
5797,"Very disappointed with the customer service at the pharmacy.

After my dr sent over a prescription, I headed here to pick it up.  The clerk informed me that the prescription would need pre-authorization from the insurance company, so they sent it back to my dr to get that.  Okay, that happens.  I've been through the pre-authorization process before with a different pharmacy, and they obviously can't do anything until then. 

I went back the next day.  Different clerk.  Still not authorized.  She gave me more explanation, some differing from what I had been told the day before, and some new info - the likely timeframe (3-5 business days).  I pointed out at the time that what she told me differed from what the other clerk had told me the day before.

Was driving by after the 5th business day so I stopped by to check.  Same clerk as the second visit.  Still not authorized.  Okay.  But then she gave me the spiel about the authorization process again, but with more changes.  

She also added that they'd call me when it was ready.  I pointed out that was the first time they said they'd call me - obviously I wouldn't have stopped in if I knew I was waiting for a call from them.  The first clerk offered to text me, but I don't have a phone that accepts text messages, and without her then offering to call me I verified that I could call them to check.  And this clerk hadn't mentioned it during my second visit.  But she became adamant that she told me that the previous visit - she could remember our entire conversation from 6 days earlier - pretty amazing memory, if you ask me, given all the customers she must have dealt with.

I asked to speak to the pharmacy manager, which was a worthless exercise.  She kept trying to turn it into a discussion re they can't do anything until they get confirmation of the authorization - Duh! - instead of the fact that in three visits I couldn't get consistent information from the clerks that she supervises on their process once they get authorization.

The manager wouldn't even assure me of them calling me when the prescription was ready, citing reasons - including freaks of nature or she could get hit by a car and die tonight.  Again, Duh!  (And supremely weird.)

To CVS, here's an idea on what to say, pieced together from information gleaned over three visits to this pharmacy:

""We had to send this prescription back to your doctor because he needs to get pre-authorization from your insurance company.  We can't do anything further with this until we are notified that it has been pre-authorized.  This could take 3-5 business days or longer.  Once we have it ready we will call or text you.  Until, you will need to contact your doctor directly to check on the status of this.""

Short.  Sweet.  To the point.  And apparently accurate (although i might have to change it if I were to go back a fourth time.)  It would have saved me two trips.


My only other experience with this pharmacy was last fall when I stopped by for a flu shot.  There were no customers at all in the pharmacy area (and almost none in the entire store).  Yet I was told I'd have to wait 40 minutes.  I didn't wait.

I'm new to in-store CVS pharmacy visits, and this store in particular.  The manager and her clerks simply make CVS look bad.  And inept.

FOLLOW UP:  I should have waited to post this.  When I checked with my Dr's office re the status of the prescription and the insurance company, they had no record of having been contacted (initially or follow-up) by this CVS pharmacy to let them know the insurance company was requiring pre-authorization.

We ended up switching brands of insulin pens, and the prescription was ready the day before I was heading out of town.

That evening when I opened it up, I discovered that they did not include any instructions.  Once I found instructions online, I discovered that I needed to buy needles (sold separately) in order to use the pens.  These folks knew that I was new to this - I told them, and it said so on the prescription.  I didn't have time to deal with this before heading out of town first thing the next morning, delaying my starting to use insulin by almost three weeks.  Not good.

Before getting a refill I transferred the prescription to a different CVS store.  That new store did include instructions with the insulin pens.  They asked me for contact information so that they could call me when the refill was necessary.  They asked me if I had needles.  All without any prompting.

That just made the CVS pharmacy at 7285 S Durango Dr looking all the more incompetent and terribly managed.  Too bad, as it's more convenient than the store I transferred it to.  But I'll trade off some convenience to avoid this pharmacy's disastrous so-called service.",1

I work with semi precious all the time so I am positive they are genuine, however before I spend $8 on a necklace I'm curious and ask her if she knows what type of stone. Well she snaps at me and says they're not! It's plastic. Wow okay, so I just leave.  Months later I'm thinkng to possibly consign some of my sterling and semi precious necklaces to this shop. And without even asking me what I had, she tells me they only sell clothes shoes and handbags. Okay...what about the huge rack of jewelry? Lol wow your loss!  You're a terrible business owner and extremely disrespectful!

He had the Seafood Stir-fried Noodles (shrimp, fish ball, scallop and crabmeat), and I had the Prawn Stir-fried Noodles.

Guess it's more expensive if you don't buy the tires from them since they asked me if I bought the tires from them.  Then I called Xtreme to see how much they charged and was told $27.50 per tire.  Went there and watched them do it at the window.  I found out it wasn't as simple as removing the tire and replacing it as I experienced at other places.  As I watched them do each tire, I thought to myself that $27.50/tire was definitely worth it for the work that was done.  Job took about an hour to do.  I will definitely go back.",5

I reported the problems we had after Maze left repeatedly when I asked for them to come re-spray.

5831,"Some things never change... and for Saigon Pho and their customers, that's a Good Thing!

The first day in the Phoenix area... more specifically, Chandler, brought me the ONLY Vietnamese Pho place I have ever frequented in Arizona... really, I have yet to try another Vietnamese Pho restaurant in this state!

And... without a glance at my previous reviews... I virtually ordered the exact  same combination of entrees...

Chicken Rice Soup #51 (***** $4.95... increase of $0.50) After two years, there only has been an increase of just fifty cents for this Rice Porridge Soup.... JUST FIFTY CENTS! I have no doubt other Yelpers have noticed portion reductons and / or price increases in their favorite restaurants. In just two years an increase this infinitesimal is a bargain!

You'll receive your Porridge, which is just boiled Rice to a glutinous consistency, in a 6-inch wide bowl, with the addition of pulled Chicken meat, fermented Turnips, bits of Ginger, and Green Onions. A very simple Soup, don't you think?

Along with either Porridge or Pho, I also order...

Beef Chow Fun #39 (***** $6.50-no change in price) A very, very affordable Chow Fun... as inexpensive as you'll find anywhere!

Stir-Fried wide Rice Noodles with marinated strips of Beef,  Bean Sprouts, Yellow Onions, Green Onions in a Sweet Soy Sauce! Delicioso!

My friend, whom I visited on this trip... even though he is Chinese, never had Chow Fun of any kind in his life... stated this is one of the best Chinese entrees he ever had! I had to remind him that this IS a Vietnamese place... and Chinese would never make SWEET Chow Fun, even though it was VERY, Very good.


I, initially, wanted an order of Oysters in Black Bean Sauce..  but the waitress stated the restaurant stopped serving Oysters because customers started returning the entree... Saigon Pho, the last time I ordered it in  Black Bean Sauce, then had the LARGEST Oysters I had seen short of seeing it served in a coastal city like San Francisco. The Oysters can be very intimidating... they're HUGE! I kid you not, if you special order it now... you would think the Oysters were aided in their growth by artificial means. If my stay in Arizona were longer... I would not hesitate in ordering this. But I had to resort to....

Clams with Basil Leaf (**** 1/2 Market Price) A HUGE order of Clams cooked with Basil, in a sweet Soy Sauce concoction! The PILE of Clams musta been over four inches high!

Saigon Beef Rice Noodle Soup (Not Rated $5.95) My friend's order...
 
Ice Coffee with Condensed Milk #54 (***** $2.50) WAAAYYY better than that Italian stuff... Way, WAY BETTER!
   
... And you get to percolate it yourself at the table... if you want to, that is. This is one of the very few Vietnamese restaurants that will let you ""do it yourself"", as most restaurants want to ""turn"" your table as fast as possible.

   Some views of the Viet Coffee dripping, and dripping, and dripping...

I was amazed at the sheer number of positive reviews for this place, yet I've never heard of them. So into my Yelp bookmarks it went for the perfect afternoon to go here. After an amazing visit here (and 2 punches on my regular customer card) I'm hooked. 

If you think you'll leave hungry since it's just a hot dog, no you're wrong. I always get a brat and it's filling! I've now had the Island Dog and Hanalei Dog, my lovely date the last time I went had the Island Dog so I was able to have the best of both worlds. I also get the volcano spiced version. It's has a perfect amount of spice to it, so for the average eater, don't get it lol! 

As for the sides: 

I had the tater tots. They are great to share, unless you have an islander sized appetite then get your own. 

Shave Ice. They do it right here. We split a crazy concoction where they added a bunch of awesome flavors. They build it right. After adding some flavors, the ice melted down a lil, so they added more. Then top it off with ""crack"". We had a bunch of funny jokes around it but it's condensed milk. This place also doesn't disappoint considering your in AZ. 

So if you're reading this considering to go, make dinner plans tonight, or tomorrow for lunch. They need the biz and your stomach needs the flavor. It's tired of eating that frozen crap you keep in your office freezer. I hope to fill up my regular customer card sometime soon.",5

5854,"typically I find hotels to nearly be the same all around the world. However, the Residence Inn Tempe has comfortable rooms with plenty of outlets for electronic devices - and easy to reach and access. 

The front desk staff and hotel service is the best experience. Everyone is ultra friendly. There is paid parking connected to the hotel which is connected to your room key. The hotel is adjacent to Mill Avenue with plenty of restaurants within walking distance. 

There is a pool, gym and whirlpool on the 11th floor. It has an amazing view and had towels by the pool so your don't have to lug around towels from your room. There is laundry on the 2nd floor with state of the art washers/dryers. My room had a full kitchenette and full size refrigerator. You could not ask for more. 

Prices are a bit high compared to other locations, but perhaps worth the cost if you want a nicely kept property and convenience of nearby attractions.",5
5856,"I signed up for unlimited group class ($50) and it's the best thing I've ever done!  Not only the group classes fun and easy to follow, they have classes everyday with great variety.  Also the teachers are very helpful and accomodating. Everyone (including all of the students) is so welcoming and nice. It's the best environment for any dance lovers!!!",5
5858,"We frequent Easy Life Boba anytime we are in the area, and/or really craving a delicious, refreshing drink!!  I always get the same thing, which is a peach slush, they are great for hot summer days and nights here in Vegas!!  I don't recommend hanging out there in the shop, it is very hot in my opinion!!   Maybe this is just due to the sweltering summer heat...who knows, or by design to give extra incentive to get an ice cold drink once inside?  Either way, don't let that persuade you not to try one!!  Definitely a must try for all Boba Lovers out there!!",5
5861,"A fantastic eyebrow threading experience. The price was right. The technique, care, attention to detail, astringent, aloe vera after-treatment and mini-eyebrow massage were all fantastic. I will definitely be a repeat customer!",5
5862,This place is so beautiful and calming. I had a great time with my girlfriend taking pictures and watching the fish and baby ducks. 7 dollars to get in is a little pricey for the size of the place though. But I guess they must charge that much to keep the place running. Would definitely recommend,5
5863,There meal prep is impeccable!! tried several different places but they really do it right. Five days a week soon turned into seven days a week no more grocery store for me.,5
5865,"This place is my number one spot to visit when I go to Vegas.
They have a vast selection of snack foods, lots of beef jerky. Hey, they have cuttle fish, which is rare, and they also have ika, which is spicy cuttlefish.  Don't forget to buy some and any other type of snack food, because they have a wide selection that will satisfy any palate.
 I had a good conversation with the owner who went to the Oakland A's Yankees game. He and his wife are very nice and friendly. I went in their with my hecka brother in law and family. Hope you enjoy! 

Mahalo!",5
5867,Amber is a great stylist. I'm very happy with the work I get from her! My hair always feels amazing and looks fantastic! She is very friendly and makes me feel super comfortable!,5
5868,"AMAZING NICE PPL & CAR BUYING EXPERIENCE BY FAR!! This place is seriously the anti-stereotypical dealership. Steve was extremely accomodating and easy going. He gave me a WAY better deal than the 6 other places I went to. The entire process was comfortable and the nice ambience and total attention made it actually feel like a special experience. I was hesitant at first, but the kudos to Steve had me try it out. He is the man, full of integrity and has that pride and stake in the organization that makes you want to support local people rather than huge corporations. Dropped off car and paperwork during my lunch. Gave me a much better rate than the credit union I've paid off more than 8 cars with!! They run a lean operation, no high overhead, fees etc. You owe it to yourself to make buying a car an easy rewarding experience!!! Thanks so much Steve and Co.!!",5
5869,I used this florist last minute and they delivered exactly as described same day - four custom arrangements!  Gorgeous and cost effective.  Highly recommend,5
5872,"There is no better place to go for a great, easy breakfast in Vegas for the price.

They have such a wide selection of egg dishes for breakfast, delicious stuffed french toast, a wide range of lunch selections... total food boner.

The eggs are always done perfectly, the toast is crisp but not burnt, the service is excellent... it's an awesome modern diner.

Also, Cracked Egg is giving Poppy's Frozen Yogurt a run for its money with the jailbait cashiers.",5
5874,I went down here to their south location tosee their Doctor Joel and he was amazing. Their north location was convenient for me but I gladly made the drive to get treated extra fast for my extreme lower back pain. Their south office is so warm and inviting my comfort level for as much pain as I was in was high. I have to say his ability to find the points seemed better than any other doctor I had been to when I first had acupuncture years ago. He really knew my pain and what was necessary to help it!,5
5875,Best Pizza Toronto and this coming from someone who has lived in Naples. Staff were great also.,5
5876,"I come here every year for the same conference which happens to fall around the time of my birthday.  Being in Vegas for work is sort of a drag.  You're working.  Everyone else is partying.  You're up in daylight.  Everyone else is just getting home by daylight. 

The staff at Caesars are great.  I always get my room upgraded without any trouble.  The casino is completely useless to me.  I discovered the spa on my last visit and I'm planning to work it into my regular Caesars routine.",5
5878,"I'm a cupcake queen. I'm also not fat for nothing. I've tried many cupcakes over the years, even the so called ""famous ones"". Don't  be mislead. Believe me when I say, cupcakes by Kate are the absolute best in the country hands down. Super moist, fresh and not super sweet. They make you forget your name. No matter where you are coming from, it's worth the drive. The workers are extremely nice and friendly as well. I love supporting businesses that are great all the way around.",5
5879,"I absolutely loved the vibe I got when I walked into this place! And the beautiful display of gelato and treats made me drool. 

The man that helped us out was very friendly and we ended up chit chatting for a bit. Tis' the pumpkin season and I'm a huge fan of pumpkin so I'm sure you can guess which flavor gelato I got. Absolutely amazing. I also got to sample the fresh baked cookies. I think I'm going to be addicted to this place. Can't wait to come back here and try all the different flavors.",5
5880,"So the last time I was here was July 2006 and now I know why.  The place itself is cute in a very dated way.  The service was very good but the food is nothing to rave about at all.  We ordered a house salad that came out almost as a soup because of how much dressing was on it, same went for the Chicken Marsala, drowned in sauce you had to search for the chicken.  Ordered a side of penne with oil and garlic, there was so much garlic you could keep vampires away for a lifetime, deeming it inedible, and the pasta was not cooked well either to boot.  The others we dined with seemed to like their food but all complained about things drowning in sauces and lack of real flavors.  With so many options in Tempe and the surrounding area, just go somewhere else for Italian food.",1
5881,"TOT cafe closed down(temporarily) so I found this place. Compared to TOT cafe, this cat cafe is cleaner and more comfortable, the cats roam around the entire store. You only need to order one drink (~$5, it's a few dollars cheaper than TOT). The vanilla ice latte is good. The cats only wanted my treats lol. They seem to liven up and follow you when treats were involved. But they seemed friendlier than the ""orphan"" cats at TOT, when I reach out to pet some of the TOT cats they would do that flexible cat bending thing and slide. These cats are owned by the store owners so maybe that's why they're not as unfriendly. 
Beware of Coco the fatty. She kept begging for treats. There was an interesting one with a grumpy face and snagged tooth. It would watch you from far, wanting a treat but then you approach and it runs away lol",5
5882,"I've heard so much about this place and I'm so mad that I haven't had it and I literally drive by it everyday! First time for me. had the donair pizza but really wanted to try 1 of every pizza they had for pizza by the slice. what more can I say...but go try it for yourself, you will not be disappointed...its really that good. Full of toppings and oh so much cheese! I wish I would've got one more slice!  All positives for me...good job Seniore!",5
5883,"Check out their website - they have a great selection (and even more to choose from at their warehouse!)  The photos and descriptions on their website are realistic to what you will find at their warehouse.  They are in an industrial area, but still easy to find.  Great prices and terrific selection.  They have seasonal items on special too.  I should have bought that autumn wreath I saw on my way out the door :(",5
5884,"They have multiple lifted trucks on their website which lead you to believe they are on sale with HUGE end of year discounts.  However, they said it was a misprint and that it would be another $8400.00 on top of the internet price.  The sales rep Antonio tried to appologize but really didnt say much more.  Frustrated with the incorrect information on the web (as there were three of these trucks that they are saying are priced wrong) I decided to test drive another truck.  It took him 20 minutes to find the key and actually get the truck.   After taking a look at the truck, I decided I wanted to test drive.  He gave push back when I asked for him to actually get a dealer test drive plate.  Once he got the plate, we got on the freeway, and the tires were out of balance in which the response was they just need air.  This wasn't the worst part though, while driving, he received a call from another customer and spoke with him for the rest of the test drive  (I must not be very important as you can see).  We finally get back to the dealership, in which I asked what the numbers would look like.  I decided to stay outside to look over the truck further.  After about 25 minutes we decided to go inside (its hot out in August), only to find out the sales agent was working on pulling details for the other client that he spoke with during the test drive.  After this happened he decided to finally go and get me a numbers sheet.  That took FOREVER as well, I was fed up and got up to leave.  This is when I met Keyon, he was real with us and actually answered and helped me for a few minutes with a couple of questions I had.  Unfortunately, we were still unable to make a deal.  

I love the fact that there is a Chevy dealership down the road from my house now, however, I'd love to have more confidence in this dealership which will be difficult after my expereince tonight.  I understand we all have off nights but this seemed more about the commission and the sale for Antonio as opposed to working with the client and working with my needs.",1
5888,"I should have read the reviews before going to this place.  Now I'm added to the victim list.  They deserve 0 star!  Looks like it's a problematic business for years!  If you want to take care of your garments, DO NOT come to this place! 

I experienced the same things the previous yelpers did.  They ruined my all white Burberry dry coat the following ways:

1. An abrasion on the left sleeve area. The fabric has a obvious scratched line on it. 

2. The inner lining with the Burberry brand label and signature pattern on it. The colour is bleached out of the pattern, the whole big area is damaged to a point that is non-reparable! Now the lining looks like it's an old pairs of jeans that was washed over 100 times! 

3. Got a new black stain on the right sleeve area. It was not there when I brought it in, it appeared after the first wash in May. I saw this and agreed for a second wash as remedy. Then the stain spread after the second wash. When I was asked to give a third chance to remove the stain, I agreed with the condition that if there is any risk of damaging the coat, it should not be washed and I shall be notified immediately. I was not notified. The coat was not ready for pick up twice after a given 'ready' date. Today I found that during the delay, Pauline, the staff made the call to inquire and was told that it was being SOAKED. The label on the coat clearly stated 'specialist dry cleaning only', soaking should not be taken place! Again, if specialist dry cleaning were not possible at your plant I should be notified. The coat should be returned untouched from the second wash. 

Like all others, I was told to contact Riz. I emailed him, I called and left messages, he just ignored me.  I reported this to the Better Business Bureau recently and the next step will be bringing it to the small claim court.

According to what they have promoted on their official business website, after contacting them about the damage, they will 'conduct a thorough and timely investigation', sadly it was not my case. I have been calling, leaving messages in store and in voicemail, and emailing for a week, without a single respond, it cannot be called 'timely'! They also promoted their level of customer care as 'Attention to detail and care is paramount in ensuring the clients' expectations are met and exceeded. At The Preeners Custom Fabricare a satisfied client is the foremost objective, all strategies and efforts are geared to ensure that this happens.' Again, I experienced the opposite, I have been trying to contact a manager (I was told Rees is the only manager) who takes care of complains for more than a week, I still receive no response by any means.

This company have issues with cleaning service, customer service, warranty promises, and false advertisement on their website! 

When I see all other victims having the same issue, I would like all of you who are interested in pursuing justice to contact me.  We have to be gathered together to have a voice.  We have to do something to stop this Preeners scam going on in our city and get back the compensation we deserve!",1

5902,"I recently figured out my severe foot pain was due to plantar fasciitis... classic symptoms.  Dr T was able to fit me in asap for acupuncture then we discussed many home care remedies I can do to expedite the healing of this painful condition.  I returned for traumeel injections which hurt, but I am convinced they were the key to a speedy recovery.  All the literature I read said it could take up to a year to heal.  I'm in month # 2 of treatments and feel 90% better. 

He is knowledgeable, friendly, professional and very gentle.  He is clearly passionate about healing and I will be recommending him highly!",5
5904,"My husband picked this place, and I was nervous because I tend to like Westernized Japanese food (you know, those rolls with cream cheese and sweet sauce). And while I've never been to Japan, Yuzu seemed like it would be rather authentically Japanese. I was wrong to be nervous -- everything we got was delicious. We ate the homemade tofu (fried version), a bento box, Matt's Roll, black sesame pudding (he loved it, I didn't), and a strawberry mochi (only one -- I could have eaten 6). 

While I liked Matt's Roll, I wouldn't get it again in favor of trying something new. Based on our experience, I'd guess everything at Yuzu is good, and I'd rather try things that are more subtle (this was one of those over-the-top sushi rolls that strike me as very American).  

I was happily surprised with Yuzu and would love to go back.",5
5907,"I'll start by saying that I've never had a positive wig store experience in the past. So I didn't arrive with high hopes. As soon as I walked in, Haley did everything she could to make me feel comfortable. I got to try on many wigs, I was never rushed, I had help when I needed it, and wasn't hovered over when I didn't. I was so comfortable that I was walking around bald, looking at the different wigs, and wasn't embarrassed. I got an adorable wig for a great price and some accessories (she trimmed the bangs for me, for free). I'll be going back asap for a human hair one that I had to leave behind. 

No snobbery. No mean girl vibes. No invasive questions about why my hair is gone. Plenty of help when I needed it. Space when I didn't. No sales pressure. THIS is the wig store I've always wanted to find. I will be back again and again.",5

5910,"Great outdoor venue! Went when there was a live band (who actually were kind enough to let me sing with them) and it was a really fun time. Beautifully built outdoor bar with swings for seats. The owners are friendly and very welcoming. Felt more like we were at a friend's party in their backyard than at a bar! Good beer selection, large apps menu, and good burgers! Wonderful experience all over and I highly recommend going!",5
5912,"I went in to the store with one shoe in mind and left with another. That's because the owner took his time to find out what it was I needed and  not what I wanted. And with his knowledge of his product and the local job requirements, etc., he got me exactly the boot I needed. Sure these boots are expensive. These are high quality, made in the USA (there are some made in China, but they are less expensive), built to last and backed by Red Wing. Try taking a pair of boots back to Wal-Mart to be oiled or for new laces (both services are free at Red Wing), They'll look at you cross-eyed. Or try getting a pair of (insert chinese made brand here) boots re-soled, good luck.
All in all I was extremely pleased with the experience at the store and with the boots I was sold. That's right, I was sold a pair of boots by a knowledgeable salesman who took the time to fit me correctly and educate me about his product. I didn't walk in to a big box store and get no service from underpaid, inexperienced and untrained attendants (if you can find one) and buy a pair of boots at a bargain price. Only to have to go back in a few months to buy another pair.
The boots I bought should last approximately 2 years or more. Multiply the number of bargain boots I'd go through in that time frame and the cost is the same if not cheaper AND I've got a better boot with better foot and ankle support (translate that to less or no foot pain after a long day on my feet).
If your looking for a quality boot this is the place to go. But be prepared to get what you paid for!",5

When i went for my appointment they stuffed me in an mri machine for an average sized person.  I freaked out as i was being compressed / squeezed and had to get out. At this point i was in a panic attack mode. After i got out of their they asked me if i wanted to try their larger machine. My thought was why the f wouldnt you have put me in the larger machine to start off with. Cit was like putting 2 lbs of ham in a 1 pound bag.  The utter incompetence that i find in the medical field in las vegas (front desk and other lower level medical people is unbelievable.  No one really cares or takes the time to even fake it.

5915,Class estlishment!  I've been bringing clients here for years and have nothing but praises to sing about this place.  From food to clothing Tommy knows how to do it right.  I love everything about the company.  They make the best chicken sandwich going and know how to dress it up  in class.  I would record Tommy Bahamas for anything form lunch to and formal get together with your favorite corporation.  This place is a classy joint and the food is to die for. Don't get me started on the service and world class cocktails.  I could go on forever.  Next time you're near a Tommy Bahamas you have to check it out. Yummy and awesomeness all around.  Keep up the amazing service and excellence in everything you do.,5

You know when you get on to that second day of a fresh haircut, you look in the mirror and you say to yourself, ""I love my hair!""...That's what you'll say after you see Haifa at Ruby's Salon. It's a bit of a drive depending on where you live. I live in North town, so it's a bit of a trek for me, but way worth the drive! Thank You Ruby's for giving my tired hair a new lease on life!",5
5920,"I revisited Hibiscus Spa, since my last visit was such an amazing experience while staying at the Westin. I opted for the Hibiscus Island Paradise treatment: half salt body scrub with warm shower therapy and half coconut milk massage. Cyndi was very enthusiastic and welcoming. Sometimes it can be a little...eh, weird, to be naked in front of strangers, but she was completely professional and helped reserve modesty. 

The Spa was not crowded and i was offered beverages and snacks upon arrival and departure. You're given a locker key to put your clothes and valuables in while being provided with a robe and slippers for wear to the therapy room.

Apparently Groupon recently featured Hibiscus Spa so some services were not available. I booked a massage last year a week ahead of time with no troubles. This year i called 4 weeks in advance and no massage services were available on days i wanted. If you have a treatment in mind i'd suggest giving them a buzz asap.",5
5922,"I have been here four times before and few years ago - once for our anniversary and had good experience. Came here once again in 2015 dec - it has changed. Service is very poor. I came for three nights  with my wife and four year old. It was a spacious 1200 plus sq ft room with nice bathroom and extras. 

For every bad experience i am taking a star away in my review.. And its just first day into the stay!

1.It took 10 minutes to get a person on line to order dinner - and they dont have Kids menu! The reservation included breakfast- when called it took almost 7 mins hold to get a live person. 

2. The bed was bad that I almost hurt my back and neck by the morning. King bed is almost queen size in most of other luxury resorts

3. Electric car charging is not available at Valet... They asked me to goto Another resort to do charging! Really

4.asked for water and delivered  after almost 1 hour. Anything else you ask to the room service they say No very fast.. Asked for Foam bath and they said No..went and checked in the bathroom I found it was there in the shower.. They dont even care what they have- say no to any special request.",1
5923,"Dena our bartender, was the best bartender I have ever experienced in my drinking life. She should be given a raise. Even promoted. (no I am not a friend) she made our drinks to order and accepted our Groupon without an protest. The 4 people on our group love her.",5
5924,"Real Estate Agents and homeowners - Buyer beware! If your real estate agent gives you this company to consider for your home warranty I recommend picking anyone else! 

This is my second HORRIBLE experience with these people for 2 separate pool related equipment issues. My prior review on 10/7/16 laid out how this company says on their website they won't be overreaching in their use of ""pre-existing"" as a rejection reason but they will tell you that it isn't covered due to pre-existing even if you had a home inspection done and paid the extra add-on for the pool equipment. 

THE NEWEST DENIED CLAIM was on 5/19/17. Being under their warranty for nearly 7 months they couldn't use pre-existing to deny this claim. Instead they said that it was their opinion that it was caused by poor maintenance. They also claim on their website they are liberal on covering claims where prior homeowners maybe didn't maintain things as well as they should have. THAT IS A LIE TOO! I tried to work with Dawn at One Guard since she provided me a ""little"" assistance with the pool heater once I blasted them on Yelp. They gave half towards that repair. 

Even approaching them proactively did no good! Dawn said she would get back to me after having management review the claim again. That follow-up never happened. This issue was where a DE Filter for the pool developed cracks on the fiberglass shell then causing the other pool equipment to get flooded and trip the circuit breaker. They blamed my weekly pool guy (yes I have it professionally maintained on a weekly basis - that wasn't good enough for them either) that he must have caused the filter to ""dead head."" However, two separate professional pool repair people said that was false because it had a pressure value that prevents the system from ""blowing up."" Since One Guard wouldn't be professional and operate with Integrity to cover this claim I had to quickly have others come in and fix my system since the pool was going green. I spent over $1,200 to repair everything and get the pool clear again. I understand the policy has a $1,000 limit. 

Maybe after seeing the scathing review they come to their senses and reimburse me the $1,000 for something they should have fixed in the first place.",1
5927,I had Eric do a repair on the motor for my pool pump. Great communication! He let me know what was going on every step of the way. The repair ended up costing less than half what the estimate was and he was honest and refunded me the difference. Very satisfied customer!,5
5929,"Foodie's DREAM COME TRUE. Heaven on earth! 

We picked up macaroons, hot chocolate, cheese, dipping sauce for baguettes and seasoning. Fresh fruit and veggies available as you walk through and the vendors hustle you to buy from them....9 lemons for $1.99? Cheaper than Kroger!  Very fun vendors. 

GREAT place though I will warn you good luck on parking. We almost gave up. You have to follow one into the minimal parking lot as one leaves you go in and take their spot. One in one out. Little brutal but worth the hassle to get in and it was an amazing experience.",5
5931,"Go somewhere else! As previously stated, the service is horrible. Aside from that, I ordered a lemonade...they were out. My b/f ordered a Lumberyard Pale Ale....they were out. Our server was not helpful and all the servers were literally running down the aisles trying to help people and it was NOT even busy. I ordered the 3 Flags and my b/f ordered the house special burrito, without the rice and beans, and no sour cream. Our food came, my 3 flags was all very dry and small portion (fine) and my b/f's burrito came with rice, beans and sour cream. Since our waitress NEVER came back until she wanted to clear our plates, he decided not to deal with it and never ate it. They even charged us for the rice & beans. Instead of speaking up if we could even find her, we decided to show it on the tip and wrote a note on the bill. We will never go back. Bad service, no drinks available that we wanted, and ""meh"" food.",1
5932,"Last year my sweety bought me a spa day for xmas from this salon.  I went for the treatment which included a facial, a body wrap, massage and mani pedi..  The services were great and I became a fan of this place immediately.  After checking on what other services they provide, I came across the lash extention option.  I have done this in the past with others service providers and was suprised to see that they offer the service at 150$ for initial visit then 50$ for upkeep appointments, (I had always been charged 250$ and 100$), so I took the chance and got the lashes.  Nancy is the lash girl, and she is absolutely adorable, reliable, super accomadating and available, and she does a very good job.  I highly recommend this place for this service, it is less expensive and she does a good job, I have also used their services for a mise en plis, and have been quite happy.

Another plus for this place is that they have these VIP evenings for their clients every now and again, to have an information session (the event usually has some food and wine and prizes and gifts), which is a really nice way to show their clients they care.

This is a salon/school, and you can choose the person pro or student, which can mean saving some money.  The salon is very bright and clean, and in a great easy access location on Prince Arthur.  If you or anyone you know is looking for some TLC spa services, at an affordable price, this should be your first stop.",5
5933,"So good! Officially my favorite pho place in Arizona.  Looks like a hole-in-the-wall from the outside, but those always end up being the most delicious places. The coconut water came in an actual coconut (that we ate and it was really tasty and fresh) and it was VERY refreshing.  For my pho, I ordered off the menu with the better grade meat and got the one with everything in it and added oxtail.  I tasted the broth before seasoning it and it was everything but bland! You could really taste the flavor of the meats that were cooked in it and if I wasn't so addicted to sriracha, I would've eaten it plain.  I also asked for half noodles (something I always do because I can't finish) and for once, I actually had 70% meat and 30% noodles. Bottom line: this place does not skimp out on meat like most other places do. I had so much meat that I barely finish it, and that is rare for me.  One thing that stood out the most to me and my friend (who ordered the tendon and brisket pho) was the quality if the tendon. It was flavorful and had just the right texture so you know it was fresh and not overcooked to the point where it was mushy.  The only thing I could've done without was the oxtail because it was kind of a pain to eat with so many people around. The place is big with plenty of seating and almost packed so we had to share a long table with another group, so if you're not into that don't come on a weekend afternoon. I'm definitely going to be frequenting this place even though it is 30 minutes from me, and I can't wait try more items off their menu.",5

We've had their cheese curds, nachos, pizza and wings so far, all were a total knockout. Great use of the old Bellini's space, 

Also love that the downstairs is set up with it's own bar (Tiny Tiki Shack!) and lots of games, darts, Golden Tee, etc, to keep everyone entertained at half-time. We will definitely be regulars here and hope they stick around!",5
5935,"I'm only here to give the place some love.  Gotta say, best fatty brisket I've ever had.  Great selection of sauces and the staff is super cool too.",5
5936,"I have been eating here for about 7 years now. It is one of my two favourite fish & chip places in the city!! The food is always fresh and hot. The bread and butter is a fave as well, the bread is so fresh and the thick slices make you feel spoiled. The fries I like a little well done and you can ask for some scraps.. which are the bits of batter left in the fryer from the fish cooking.. yum!!! 

The staff are always friendly and personable. If you go often enough they start to remember your order!! ha!! The prices are very reasonable. The dining area is very clean. 

I'm not a huge fish fan but I go every couple of months to satisfy my halibut craving!! :0)",5
5937,Nadia helped my roommate and I find condo in Toronto. She was very helpful in taking us around to the different places. She did a great job in tailoring our search so we didn't waste time going to condo's that didn't fit our specifications and was very organized so our search went smoothly. She was also very good at responding in a timely manner and giving us insights into things we should consider as we hadn't lived in a condo before. Overall Nadia was very professsional and I recommend her to all my friends.,5
5938,"It's very rare that a place truly impresses me. This place knocked it out of the park. Just stopped in today for takeout on a recommendation from a friend. First of all, the place is so dang clean that you could eat off the floor. Very impressed by that! I ordered a chorizo breakfast burrito and rice and beans. PHENOMENAL. Fresh authentic Mexican food. Not greasy. High quality. Prices are completely fair for the quality of the food. I will definitely return to this place and bring friends with me.",5
5939,Love this place.  Neighborhood feel with wonderful food.  It never disappoints.  It can get crowded but the wines are plenty and a table usually becomes available.,5
5941,"Food was to die for that guacamole take just like my grandma used to make it while I was growing up as a kid! The only thing is we ordered a quesadilla as an app along with the guacamole and they forgot to bring it out so when the manager came to check on us we told him, not as a complaint cuz we didn't  want to get anyone in trouble, but to make sure we didn't get billed for it. He said he would take care of it and since we were so nice about it he took the other appetizer off the bill as well. Very kind man who happened to grow up where we are from.!",5
5947,Great food  had a assortment. Of things and all prepared  excellent. The service  very helpful on telling you the menu.   Will go back again,5
5949,Best car buying experience ever. If you are looking for a cheap reliable car this is the spot. When they said no credit check they mean it. Saw there ad on Craigslist went in and looked around the lot found a clean g20. Told them about my situation and they worked with me to get a deal with no pressure at all. They were upfront about down payments and monthly payments what would work. Best part is the whole process only took about an hour half only because insurance company took long. I will always return to this location as well as refer people here. No other place like this thank you guys at used car outlet.,5
5950,"Do yourself a favor and don't take your child here unless you feel like being judged by the doctors.

Took my sick daughter here today. First of all we walk in and we were the only ones in the office. There was only one lady doing both check in and check out, answering phones, etc. This prolonged the process way longer than needed. After waiting 30 min to be seen (again we were the only ones in there!), my daughter (2 yr old) tested positive for the flu. This was after starting a fever on Friday which broke on Sunday but started back up again today. She was told to take tamiflu and I said I didn't think I wanted to give her tamiflu because I read horrible things about it and my sister had a bad experience with it with one of her sons which I didn't remember what had happened. The doctor was very very rude and very judgmental making comments such as ""so your not going to give the medication to your daughter because of something that happened with your sisters son which you don't know what it was?"" Also telling me ""the death rate in Clark county is at and all time high"" Lastly, when joking that my daughter better not give me the flu because I'm pregnant she replies very rudely ""your doctor didn't talk to you about a flu shot?"" I told her I was only 10 weeks pregnant therefore I only have had one OB appt so far. 

Oh also I called my daughter's pediatrician after the appt because my daughter started her fever on Friday and tamiflu is only effective the first 24-48 hr. The pediatrician's office said that tamiflu is only effective from the first onset of fever so it wouldn't be effective to start taking it now...

Really should be more considerate and caring, considering you are working with children.",1
5951,"My best friend just got married here, and it was WONDERFUL.  Words really can't describe just how wonderful it was for Joe & Tate - and all of us walked away impressed with how well run this busy chapel is.  Definitely a great reason to visit Las Vegas - seriously how often is one driven into his/her wedding in a pink cadillac?  :)  Congrats Tate & Joe!",5
5952,Forget this place. Bartenders demanded a 15% tip for water downed drinks and there was a $25 cover.,1
5953,"My g/f and I come here about once a month and we are never disappointed.  The food is excellent.  I usually get the sukiyaki and she gets the shabu shabu.  If you get the sukiyaki, I have some recommendations.  First, order the raw egg with the meal.  Crack the egg into the small bowl they give you with the egg, then beat to mix the egg yoke and white together.  When you pull a piece of cooked food out of the hot pot, dip it in the egg then eat.  When I dip a piece of the cooked meat in the egg, then put it in my mouth, it melts...  So good and there's nothing else like it.  I would also recommend that you order a side of mushrooms and udon noodles to add to your hot pot.  

Check the web site for specials.",5
5954,"First off I'd like to say I was prepared for a long wait because of other yelpers. But thankfully I was out of baggage claim at 7:25 am and at the hotel before 8 am. We prepaid for the shuttle online and instructions told us exactly where the SuperShuttle booth was. Upon arriving at the booth no one was there. But that's ok because according to our confirmation if the terminal 3 booth was unoccupied, a number was given to call the terminal 1 booth. 

The first call went straight to voicemail so I called again and a lady picked up and put me on hold. She was apparently helping another customer. I was on hold for maybe 5 minutes or less (not her fault, I think she was the only worker). As soon as I got off the phone within 3 minutes,  a van pulled up. The driver was pleasant and informed us of one more stop at terminal 1. We waited a few minutes at terminal 1 but I think the person we were picking up canceled (I was watching his screen, it should 3 pickups (my boyfriend, myself and the 3rd party). But then the 3rd person disappeared. The driver apologized and said ""I guess we came here for nothing."" And then we were on our way. The driver dropped us off right in front of the check in doors, grabbed our luggage for us and walked away without a tip but my boyfriend grabbed him before he left because he was good to us, even providing tips about timeshare people and safety here.",5
5956,"My favorite bookstore. They have an awesome selection of new and used books. There is also a gift boutique with perfect little knick knacks that make perfect presents!
The Wildflower restaurant that is attached has amazing food and a delicious bread selection!",5
5957,Waited for 45 minutes for my husband to get his hair cut because he was skipped. When we asked if he was next they said he had one person in front of him when the only other person in the place came in after us. There were five people working and only one cutting hair. The rest stood up at the register. They said it was cause they couldn't figure out their new system. I don't see how it took 4 people to figure it out. We just left. Lost our business.,1
5960,"They called me in Nov 2015 asking me to take the paper at a discount. I agreed and after 4 weeks I called because I had not received the paper yet.  They assured it would start but it never did. I called again a few weeks later and asked for a refund and they basically begged me not to cancel and to give them one more chance. Very unprofessional and I refused several times and finally demanded a supervisor so I wouldn't have to keep repeating ""no, please cancel and give me a refund"". They would NOT transfer me to a supervisor and promised to have one call back. Of course one never did. I received refund mid January and of course, it is for less than half the amount they charged me in Nov (remember, I never received even ONE paper delivered).  So I call again to a land far away where they can't understand what I'm saying and they say they will turn it over to some dept and in 5-7 days they will get back to me.  I will NEVER sign up again...their customer service is outsourced and crappy and it is not worth the headache.",1
5961,"I was at this Tony Romas on Nov 21, 2011 for there 12.99 Steak n lobster with family and three of us order the same special!! But i guess you get for what you pay!! My steak and  was so bad that it was full of fat hard to chew was so disappointed that even my sisters and my boyfriends was just as bad!! My sister mentioned to the server after he came to our table and asked us how everything was and as soon as my sister mentioned the steak was rubbery and he just ignored us and just walked away!! I will say that he also took a long time to bring us our check let alone never came back to collect the check after he dropped it off!!  I was so disappointed that I should have walked away without paying because no one seem to notice but of course I'm not a person to do that so I had to find someone to take my money so i went straight to there greeter!!   The one thing I will say is I did not leave a tip to our server!! This place already charged me enough for a rubbery full of fat no meat steak that the service did not deserve a tip!!! I will never come to any of the Tony Roma's since they are over priced anyways!!!   so don't waste your money on the Special!!!",1
5965,Worth every penny. Was really happy with the service provided both by the receptionist and technician. They do everything they can to make sure you leave with a big smile on your face. I had to go for two session because my baby wasn't cooperating the first time. She took up 8 mins of my video recording just to try to get her to show her face. I was asked to come back for another session. This time they advised me to drink something cold and eat something sweet 20 mins before my ultrasound. It worked! The technician was really patient with me and my baby. She took her time to really capture beautiful face images of my baby. They extended my time to make sure they get the images right. So happy with the result and so grateful for the wonderful service. Ps. Don't forget to avail Yelp voucher $20 for $40 value or check in to get 10% off,5
5966,"Yay for FEZ, I need to visit again.  I used to go there all the time, brunch, lunch, dinner and um, happy hour :)  Love love love sitting on the patio.  Since I moved to the east valley I haven't frequented as much, but it's always a treat when I do.  

My favorites are the apricot chardonnay fusion.  I always have to have that, actually I usually go with a friend and we split a carafe (or two).  Their hummus I think is the best hummus I've ever had and I never thought I liked sweet potatoes, till I had FEZ's sweet potato fries.  Everything is pretty reasonably priced too, which is always a plus.",5
5967,It is very rare that I go in here leaving without buying anything. Their women's clothing section is awesome (especially the dresses.) I go here once a week I love it so much. Highly recommended.,5
5969,"Brought my dog in because he stopped eating and was very weak and lethargic. The doctors who worked with my poodle were so wonderful and genuinely caring. They asked me on how to proceed and gave me options. I trusted them to get me dog better and they tried out a few different tests. After a few days they diagnosed him with tick fever. I was so relieved and overjoyed that they found the cause. They gave my dog some medicine and he was back to his normal, playful self. I recommend this place because they do care genuinely about the well-being of your pet.",5
5971,"Dr. Tang is an amazing dentist! He treats you like family and completely puts you at ease.  He's thorough, straight forward and honest. He also doesn't try to sell you things that you don't need. He takes his time going over your x-rays with you and answers all your questions and concerns. He shows empathy towards his patent's and that isn't something you see very often in health care nowadays.


Erin was my hygienist, and she shared a lot of great information about at home care with me during the visit. She also seemed concerned about my comfort, and during the cleaning she asked if I had any sensitive areas and continued to check on my comfort level throughout my whole cleaning. I was very happy with my experience, 

The office staff is super friendly, accommodating, knowledgeable  and communicative. Theresa always makes my visit enjoyable by always remembering my name when I walk in the front door which makes it  so much more personable. It's nice to go somewhere where everyone knows your name. After my first cleaning I was recommended  to do a ZOOM whitening treatment which I've been thinking about doing for awhile now anyways and the fact they gave me an awesome deal I set up my second appointment for it. They were even so nice to not even give me a courtesy  phone call, but I also received a text message also to to remind me of my upcoming appointment.  I will be sure to update this review after that!",5

Thank you!",5

5979,"Excellent pizza!   Numerous options for toppings, awesome crust, and you can get a personal 8"" or 16"" to share.  They also have other items such as different appetizers and tacos, next time we will definitely have to try those.  It is also a great location on central ave and a great spot to watch the games.",5

They got tons of selection   Including Japanese sushi,sashimi, Korean grills. The food was very delicious, I specially love the crab leg,pecking ducks, egg pudding also is my favorite desert. The severs is very friendly, they brought me a cake singing the birthday song for my .",5

5984,"My boyfriend and I visited Madison this weekend for the first time. We were shopping on State Street and he asked the girl working at Pop Deluxe if she had any lunch recommendations. (Side note: Pop Deluxe was a really fun store.) She told us about Mediterranean Cafe and I am so glad we decided to take her advice and check it out! We both got the falafel plate which came with hummus, pitas, rice and salad. It was all delicious! Next time I'm in Madison I know I will go back. It was very affordable and fast! Despite the long line when we arrived, we ordered and had our food in under 5 minutes. It was under $10 each and neither of us could finish all the food they gave us. I think it definitely deserves a 5 star review.",5

5992,Bad customers service. No one spoke a spill of English. They really need to get things together and straightened up.,1
5993,Need to have the ignitor done on my oven and he wanted $145 to $160 and I ordered the part for $23 and it should only take about an hour or less to replace.,1
5994,Great office we have been taking our pets here for years. We moved across town and made the mistake to see a vet closer to our house. My dog needed a growth removed by his eye. The vet said they couldn't do it charged us $250 for exam ssn medicine sent us to specialist vet that wanted over $3000. Had a bad feeling about the specialist they started dropping the price to have it complete that day plus wanted my dog to stay at least one night. Took my dog back to desert they gave me a quote for $450 plus a dental cleaning to remove the growth. It was great service plus was as quoted and my dog was released that day. We will not be going to another office. I've seen multiple doctors here and they are all great.,5

I am so glad we didn't let the rude hosts ruin our amazing meal because, oh my god it was yummy!!

Can't wait to go back!",5

6001,"I've never complained about a mani/pedi in my life, but now that I'm reading these reviews, I can see that I'm not the only one who found Donna to be rude, intrusive, offensive, condescending, judgmental, etc. During my visit, I was asked extremely personal questions, i.e. ""Who are you voting for? Why won't you tell me who you're voting for? Why are you dating a man who isn't Jewish? Why don't you want to raise your children Jewish? Look at your nails, you have a vitamin deficiency - but you're a healthcare professional, so you should know that already."" The list goes on. The Groupon was absolutely NOT worth putting up with such an interrogation. I would never return to this establishment.",1
6003,"TOTAL SCAM! Do not be fooled by these people!! If you want to go to cheesy bars(Carlos and Charlie's) and wait around for 2 hours there and spend your night staying in lines like a little kid....go for it. If not don't give your money to these scammers!!
No drinks were provided or food. No party buses, nothing. Just waiting in line and sweating in the hot Vegas night. 
Instead find promoters on the strip that will put you  on there guest list and invite you to day and night clubs for free. Promoters will come up to you and won't sell you anything.

6006,"It just doesn't get much better than this...

SERVICE: 5
AMBIENCE: 2 (but, who cares when the foods this good)
FLAVOR: 5

TIP: ""Try new things..."" 
(*Don't JUST get the Carne Asada! I mean, don't skip it, it's great! But there are several even more flavorful options). 
- ADOBADA: I haven't ever had better... that pineapple flavor mixed with salsa roja, and the cilantro cream on top. WOW! You can even do Adobada Fries... and you should. You definitely should.
- SUADERO: a slow cooked, wonderfully marinated roast beef that melts in your mouth. Unbelievable!
- LENGUA: literally my favorite taco. Yes, it's tongue. And you need some tongue action in your mouth. Trust me. There's not a more tender flavorful cut of beef you'll find.

TIP: ""Enjoy the freebies...""
- PINEAPPLE: When you order the Adobada, ask for that side of extra pineapple
- PEPPERS: Don't miss the player of Spicy Grilled Peppers and Green Onions.
- RADISHES: Go to the condiment table and grab a baggie of sliced radishes along with some of that fresh squeezed lime juice on them. Perfect complement to a heavy greasy meal.

IN SHORT: Brave the lines... Try new things... Enjoy the freebies... and Tacos El Gordo just might blow your mind!",5
6011,"I bought a groupon and called, emailed multiple times. It took a lot to get a response and when I did, they were booking 2 months in advance.  Thats ridiculous.

But after Saturday night visit around 11pm ish I just wasn't happy with the service. For one I get there with my guest and the bartender sees that we just got there  and doesn't even ACKNOWLEDGE. Instead he walks towards some other customers and started to have a conversation( you kidding me right, was it because I'm Mexican and they where white, because that's how you made me feel). Like seriously, anyways and to top it off the bar was dirty and NO you guys were NOT BUSY. So please Manager tell your bartenders to ACKNOWLEDGE every customer more and don't make them feel some type of way!!!!",1

First time I was here was Feb 2013 I kept searching for a great view where me and my boyfriend could go and enjoy the night, it was valentines wknd and our 9th yr anniversary so I came across this place and I was amazed. I ordered the mango madness cocktail and it was seriously the best cocktail Ive ever had!! we got there at 4 and caught the sunset over las Vegas. it was GORGEOUS! a little while into it a woman came in and started singing, she had a beautiful voice.

 It was very laid back atmosphere. Ive made it a point to come here every Vegas vacation. Not only because of the view and drinks...but my now- fianc√©e proposed here that night. Man, with drinks in me, beautiful view, live slow R&B music and the BF proposing...... I was in TEARS! lol. 

We came back DEC2013 for my bday with another couple and they were amazed as well.. we ordered the mango madness and sumthing else (peach flavored) I was a bit disappointed because the mango madness didn't taste at all the same, it was in a different cup as well with no sugar rimming it tasted weird, but nonetheless we drank em, enjoyed the view and company....and the service I must say is great as well. No complaints. Well be back next month for our Anniversary again. :)",5

A week after returning the car they had not returned our deposit. So I call their lousy customer service. They were not helpful at all, they told me the $180 was for an extra service even when we decline all extras. Also they told us this was a franchise so they could not do anything.

I love how diverse the menu is and all the food I've ever ordered was really delicious. I love taking people here who have only ever had sushi for Japanese food as it's a little glimpse into other options for food in small plates, so less commitment. The atmosphere inside is very lively, and feels like you're almost not in Vegas. Parking can be a pain, but usually able to find a spot.",5

The d√©cor was beautiful and tranquil keeping in line with everything else at Cosmopolitan, the only complaint was that if you don't read the directional signs you will get lost in the labyrinth of the hotel (but that's to be expected in Vegas).

Now to the food....one word....impeccable. Every morsel of food shows the quality of choice ingredients and the pride of the culinary team. The eggs Benedict, which are a challenge at any type of buffet, were among the best I've ever had; the angry mac and cheese was a unique bite; the chicken breakfast sausages were delectable; try the salmon caper pizza so different. We shared all the little portions so that we could experience as much as possible but still couldn't try it all (or even close to).

Word to the wise, save room for dessert, I've never seen a selection like this and even though the portions are small and we shared them we still couldn't try all that we wanted to. The gelato bar was terrific and the chef was willing to put tiny amounts in the dish so you wouldn't feel bad about trying multiple flavours.

Loved this buffet and wouldn't dream of going back to Vegas and not making time for it.",5
6062,"The food is good but the owner is not really nice.  I have come in here plenty of times and she doesn't greet you or anything. I walked in today and she looked at me and didn't acknowledge the fact that I was there. Her cook said hi to me. Like I said the food is good, but they seem like they don't care to have my business so I would much rather go somewhere else.",1
6063,"Carrie, the owner of Stahl's Bakery went out of her way to make sure that my daughter, a Kent State Student would be extremely surprised for her 21st birthday. Carrie went out of her way to accommodate my special requests.  My daughter was so excited and sent me pictures. She said that everyone thought the cake was SO GOOD as well as all the cookies. From seeing the pictures, Stahl's Bakery did a beautiful cake, great looking cookie tray, fabulous chocolate coconut cookies and way exceeded my expectations. I will definitely visit this bakery when I come and see my daughter.  I ordered by phone from Kansas City, Missouri.  From speaking to Carrie, I felt very comfortable that she would meet my expectations.  Thanks to all at Stahl's Bakery",5
6064,"Really good made to order sandwiches! Basic, fresh, and uncomplicated. The beef samosas are perfect for a snack. Staff are very friendly, especially the owner. 

If they had a few other sides for lunch, the seating area would be a bit more inviting.",5
6065,"Oh, forgot to mention that there are many cast iron patio furniture outside for sitting down to enjoy the meal or drink.",5
6066,"Really wanted to like this place. Ate dinner in Fri 2/3 with my daughter. She had a bowl with chicken and shrimp, I piled every meat they had into my bowl. Food was delicious. 
However...got food poisoning which started around 5am Saturday morning. Thought I should go to the hospital during one 2-hour stretch. I'll spare you the details. An elderly person would have had their life at risk. By late evening Saturday night I was through the worst of it and improving. 
There is no doubt in my mind this illness came from my meal at this restaurant. My daughter did not get sick. 
Unfortunately, I will not be patronizing again. This is the risk you take eating at an establishment that has raw meat laid out in reach of the public for long periods of time. In fact, I'm just going to scratch Mongolian BBQ in general off my list.",1
6068,"I rarely write a review, but I'm a bit drunk and the food was delicious so here I go!
I had the Jamaican jerk chicken sausage brat with pickled peppers along with fries, Siracha aioli and a black IPA. Basically I need to come back immediately and order the same thing! The brat was flavorful and spicy and the peppers were vinegary and delicious. The IPA was top notch. The waitress was sassy and ballsy which i adore. I will definitely be back with my husband and friends. Seems to be a kid friendly and dog friendly place on the patio as well, if you like that sort of thing. Sad I waited so long to try this place.",5
6069,"Excellent show, amazing visual effects. Sound is great. The stage set up was electric and fun.  I was expecting an intermission but never got one. I've previously only seen the shows in a big arena or the tent. While they are all good the Vegas style was by far the best. Top notch performing.",5
6070,"Wonderful customer service, they always take care of me! Kudos to manager, Steve, who is very helpful and overall a great guy. Edward and Kim always gives me the best possible service and rates, with a smile! I will always rent from you guys!",5
6072,"Trust these guys with my business and they have exceeded expectations every time.   It's not simply about doing a job, they ask the right questions to make sure everything is prepared for the intended goal of the final product too - they are smart, creative, experienced and have helped my local business succeed - can't ask anything more.",5
6073,"A water pipe broke in my uncle's front yard while he was on vacation this summer. A slow, gentle leak octupled his water usage. Six weeks later and a few thousand miles away, my uncle got his water bill and his jaw drop registered 6.8 on the Richter scale. Japanese nuclear reactors rhythmically swayed in agreement.

Who did he call? Me.

Who did I call? Rich.

He was out the next morning with clear options, simple pricing and then the hard choice that confronts every dweller in Plato's Cave. I could take the blue pill -- the story ends, my uncle wakes up in his watery bed and believes he can move in with me. Or the red pill -- I stay in Mesa, and Rich shows me how deep the pipe trench goes. Remember: all he's offering is the truth. Nothing more.

I chose wisely and before I can even return for lunch the next day, Rich has the damn thing fixed, tested and yard back in shape, all for a good price. As they say, plumbing is emotion put into measure:

I told Rich this with a sigh,  
Somewhere hours and hours past:  
Two solutions diverged in a yard, and we-  
We took the one more trenched,  
And that has made all the difference.",5
6074,"Would have no idea how to rate the ice cream, as after my third trip in, I was unable to make purchase.
First time I popped in was 7:30ish on a Wednesday.  Only behind one customer ordering a party cake for Saturday.  Wow, the gal (albeit) nice, was confused by his order.  When he should pick up, when to pay.  So after several minutes I left.  Then, last Saturday, got into drive thru line.  Wait in line, turn corner as we move up, only to see sign that says they are out of choc. ice cream.  Considering I was planning on a half and half cone.  So, pulled out of drive thru line, like the 2 cars ahead.  Here we are today, April 21 to try again.  Absolute confusion inside from every staff member.  Again, after a wait I finally step up to order.  No chocolate ice cream.  I was told they never have it, only vanilla??????  It was really difficult to understand the server also.  I did not see any cleanliness level either.  Place is very old and stale inside.  The inside seats 4 tables.  After this review I plan on reaching out to a main corporate type office for DQ.  This is in a very trendy spot, across from Shake Shack and Dutch Bros. Coffee and other eateries.  They need to step up their game in this area of approximately 12 casual eateries.  Two ice cream places within a block are like $8 for an ice cream.  DQ offers a typical affordable choice for soft serve machine produced ice cream.  Would no recommend, will not return.",1
6075,"DON'T EAT THE CUPCAKES! 

As a lot of the other reviewers have said, these cupcakes are more addictive than anything you have ever tried and you won't be able to quit. The only thing preventing me from eating these cupcakes 24/7 is that I live far enough away. Some people would argue that they are too expensive as well, but it's like paying for a good steak/coffee. The cupcakes produced by Crave are easily the best cupcakes I've ever had and could ever hope to create.

Seriously, go buy some of these right now.",5
6079,Awesome selection! Love the green use of tablets vs menus! Quick service! Great date night option for your boo! Definitely worth the stop!,5
6081,"I signed up for a membership last week. D helped me get all signed up, he's the best! I didn't know what I was doing except that I had intended to get a gym membership and he explained everything to me of what they offer, the classes that are included, the different locations, he covered every question and wonder I had. He was so awesome and welcoming, for that I thank him for his kindness and great customer service. Give that man a raise! Lol Since then, I've been enjoying the U-jam classes and my daily work outs. Even better that this is down the street from my house too! :)",5
6082,moved to new location in food court.  I payed $2 more today than I did the last time I was there approximately three weeks ago.  Poor quality meat in what I ordered.  Staff unpleasant.  Not going back.,1
6085,"I am 100% Chinese, so I am qualified to review this place as the Most Authentic hot pot restaurant in town. All the food here are up to the standard of authentic, like those I taste in China, not mentioned fresh and clean. All the other restaurants in town offer hot pot could not provide food up to this standard. 

Based on my personal experiences, I like the tomato soup base. It brings up the flavor in vegetables. Bonus points for the soup tastes after cooking all the meat in there. Hot pot sausage is another dish you must try. The mini eggs taste incredible juicy after cooking in the broth and the egg yolk is very tasteful. I don't eat lamb personally but my friends like it a lot. 

For the dinning environment, I would say it is good for family, nice for a date and fun for group hang outs. It totally worths for the money you pay for. Servers here are very nice and the manager keep checking on us make sure we had a good time. 
Anyway, I would say Hot Pot Lab is a fun experience. It would be a good place to treat yourself. :)",5
6086,"Main event entertainment was so much fun! We went for our work team bonding :) we did the dynamic duo. It included 1hr and a half of bowling and our choice of another activity with a buffet of our choice! We chose the ""just for fun"". It included tacos, sliders, chips and pretzels! We made a good choice. Bowling was fun! The music was great! The costumer service was outstanding! I will for sure recommend this place to anyone!",5
6090,"THE BEST UDON PLACE!!!!!! Their broth is seriously so tasty and just like the flavor you get in Japan. My husband had the normal mini udon and I had the kimchi udon. They were both delicious. Unfortunately, we live in DC so we can only come here a few times a year, but we even spoke about flying to Vegas just to eat their udon noodles!",5
6091,"I hit the STAR BY MISTAKE!! I can't even give them a PIECE of a star- they are that horrible and unprofessional. A ten year old could of done a better job then this "" so called company""! All boxes and furniture that we did get back ( half or more is still missing) was ripped, broken, holes in them, grease / stained, and completely rummaged through, brand new furniture had rips and a desk that was completely cracked and the side looked like a foot went through it.. I can go on but final word is that this company takes your stuff then tears it up ,breaks it , goes through it and holds it hostage and we paid them to do this!
Could never get ahold of Ashley the manager or at least that's what she calls herself- after the booking of this relocation transaction. She promised you the world and reassured you that everything would  go EXACTLY how you needed it too but in truth it was a unimaginable. Worst of all is we had a 4 month old infant that did not have his crib ( still doesn't- parts missing to put it together) did not have a lot of the things we needed for the baby and I explained this to them before and after pick up that this was very important to get this transaction done quickly and smoothly for the baby's sake. I had even called during the hostage point to ask them please just get the babies thinks here and we could work in other stuff later- and the one and only time I did get ahold of Ashley ( due to me using a different phone with a different phone number- they monitor your numbers) she said it was in its way.""
So in final - we did get some of our stuff - damaged and torn up / through and not one apology. 
DONT USE WEST COAST MOVERS! A BUNCH OF LOW CLASS CLOWNS TRYING TO RUN A LOW CLASS BUSINESS.
THEY EVEN SHOWED UP TO PICK UP MY LOAD IN A RENTAL TRUCK ( small one that anyone can rent) AND WHEN THEY FINALLY DID DELIVER IT TOO WAS A PENSKE RENTAL SMALL TRUCK. Don't think they even have trucks for their so called company.",1
6092,Great cocktails. Friendly staff. Amazing food. The bone marrow is beyond divine (sorry vegetarians). House-made charcuterie is also fabulous. Looking forward to winter to hit this place up again!,5
6094,"Les meilleurs cupcakes de Montr√©al, rien de moins!

Best cupcakes in town! 

Ils sont toujours frais et si d√©licieux! Non, je ne suis pas un membre de la famille, juste une grande fan de cette boutique! Je suis une cliente depuis plusieurs ann√©es et je n'ai jamais √©t√© d√©√ßue!

6096,"""In a word...Serene""

What can I say about the Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort and Spa @ Gainey Ranch?

It was our first trip to the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, and if you enjoy the simple luxuries of a short-refreshing weekend to get away from it all, this is the place to stay. The property is secluded, but yet a short drive to the main area of downtown Scottsdale. The service is wonderful, there were check-in kiosks, and plenty of receptionists (it was a mid-afternoon check-in). The rooms were clean, modern, and typical of business style hotel as most hyatts, sheratons, and other hotels of the sort. What stood out to us was the setting. The hotel as you drive up has a large fountain in the middle of square (yes, not circular) driveway, and the hotel is just plain open. You can see the large sitting area (where at night people gather to drink, mingle, and even roast marshmallows). Beyond that is what is a large pool area (1 adult only pool, and a general-large all ages pool area). More about that in a minute.

If you veer to the right of the pool area and behind it is this small yet peaceful garden, and beyond that was a full golf course. Now the piece du resistance (for me anyways is the expansive pool area). The pool has the typical hot-tub, poolside bar, but beyond that it has small basketball hoop, two volleyball nets, a sandy beach section, a couple of waterfalls, and a 3 story water slide (excellent). Now could it have been the weather was beautiful (80 degrees in late October), combined with one of my favorite pluses to a hotel, a large pool area, honestly a pool area to either bathe in the sun, sip a lovely beverage or dip in the pool, to me that's a holiday (even if it was a short weekend getaway) holiday none the less. Right, the pool being expansive yet it didn't feel too large or overwhelming with tons of other hotel guests doing the same, because then I would've gone to the adult only, you would expect the pool area to be popular right?

For checkout there are two major pluses 1, it has a computer with printer so you can print your boarding passes for your flight home, and it has spots for rental care return. As for the spa my girlfriend's sister made use of it's services, and for me I stepped into the reception area for nor more than five minutes with the combination of near whispering of the staff, the soft gentle music, and the rock laden water fountain, I wanted to sit in of the comfy chairs and fall asleep.

But you don't have to take my word for it. In essence if you stay in the Phoenix /Scottsdale area whether for a short weekend, or long holiday this has to be one of the choices to stay.",5
6097,"My kids and I love this play. It's not too crowded, inexpensive, and best of all we can bring our own food. This is a great place when you're in a budget but still able to enjoy family time under the sun.",5
6099,"Our garage door was ready to fall off. I called On Track, they were able to fit me into a same day schedule. Derrick came out and took care of everything - he also had some great advice for keeping the door up and running (or maybe closed and running?)

Wife is happy she doesn't have to park outside!!!

Thanks guys, you're awesome!",5
6100,Most amazing food and nicest people working. If you are visiting or in Las Vegas this is a MUST. Best meal I ever had.,5
6102,I've seen this Place a million times. I had a class today and I got there early so I stopped in here. All I had was coffee and bacon. They bring you a carafe of coffee which is awesome and the bacon was cooked perfect. The staff was really nice and  attentive. I'm glad I stopped in here.,5
6103,I stepped into time warp when I walked into sweet Moses back to 50's it was by far my favorite part about Ohio. Ice cream is great but honestly just the setting of the store is what makes it so amazing.,5
6106,"Mon Ami No More!  I loved this restaurant.  Seriously.  With all my heart and soul...I loved the view, the ambiance, the waiters, the food and the je ne se quoi (sp), and I had had a long-standing relationship with this restaurant, visiting at least 2-3 times a year for the past 4-5 years.  It was love at first bite and I never made a trip to Vegas without visiting at least once.  Now, I'm afraid to say, I'm not likely to go back.  

On a recent visit near the end of December, I was excited to bring 3 friends to Mon Ami.  Now, while the restaurant is known as a steakhouse, they offer many fish dishes on their menu.  On the night we came in, with an 8 pm reservation, we were informed that they were out of ALL of them.  The waitress quickly let us know, very unapologetically, that they were out of lobster, mussels, skate, trout, salmon, scallops and any other fish on the menu that evening.  We were hell-bent on getting the mussels, one of our favorite appetizer dishes at Mon Ami, and one of our visitors had his heart set on lobster.  When we asked why there was no fish available, when clearly it was largely offered on the menu, the waitress simply answered ""our fish truck didn't come today.""  Now, mistakes happen.  The world is an imperfect place.  Fish trucks miss their deliveries.  I am not a restaurateur (though I know one in the Henderson area), but I would imagine that a restaurant of this size with the volume of business that Mon Ami does  would have a back up plan should a truck not arrive.  If not, might I suggest that there is a Whole Foods store less than 3 miles away where perhaps they might have gone to pick up some fish?  

After expressing our disappointment, the waitress shared that she heard a rumor that some mussels had come in, and she would bring them to us right away.  She did, we ate them, they tasted gummy and fishy and we complained about them for the rest of our trip.  After eating steaks con frites (umm, what else were we supposed to eat at that point), we left, disappointed with the restaurant's lack of selection and poor planning, but mostly, with how their staff chose to handle the situation...without any true apologies or sense of ownership.    Unacceptable, for a long-time AMI.",1
6109,"Have been here several times. Every time the same experience:  extraordinarily rude owners who get simple orders wrong. Last time, I ordered lox and cream cheese on a bagel.  I got a bagel with lox and NO cream cheese.  Today i ordered 2 bagels with lox and cream cheese.  The owner reached for 1 bagel and began to WEIGH the lox. I watched. I spoke up again, ""2 bagels with lox and cream cheese, please."" The owner kept working.  She put the 1 bagel into a bag, turned around and began to work the cash register.  I said now for the 3rd time: ""I'd like 2 bagels with lox and cream cheese, please.""  She said: ""That is exactly what i gave you: a bagel with 2 slices of lox.""  You just can't make this up.  The place is in the bagel business and they have ZERO idea how people eat bagels and what people want with their bagels. When the owner finally made me the 2nd bagel with lox and cream cheese, and after i had paid her, she said the words that every person who orders lox and cream cheese on a bagel is waiting to here:  ""Those come with potato chips.""",1
6111,Nicest motel 6 I've been to. Had a great experience here. Very clean and up to date for the price. Water pressure is bad but that's the only complaint. I'd stay here again in the future.,5
6116,"Oh man!  I love this place, always hot fries, fresh tasting patties and never a sour puss behind the counter. I highly recommend this place.",5
6119,"My son and I had breakfast here and the food was amazing. I ordered the arugula salad because I wanted a piece of pie and didn't want too many calories. I've never eaten arugula before so I wanted to try it. Usually when you eat a salad it's nothing spectacular. This salad made me happy it was so good. My son had the banana pancakes. When he tasted the syrup he said ""This must be real maple syrup."" So happy he enjoyed his meal. I make a piont to spend time alone with each of my children. Taking them to a place that has good service and good food is important to me. Wildflower Bread Company will see us again.",5
6120,This place is awesome!! We got wings and pizza by the slice. For 20 we got 12 wings and 4 slices! Great deal! They make their food with love and you can watch them toss the dough from the dining room. Definitely would come here again.,5
6128,This place was clean with a classy look. It has a relaxing atmosphere and their servers were pleasant. I noticed from the first bite that their stock is VERY fresh. I believe that the gentleman behind bar is the owner. I noticed that he was quite skilled with a blade and quick with a dish. I was impressed with Shimogamo and I will be coming back soon. It would be a great place for a good first impression on a date.,5
6129,"We visited on a weekday morning and had the place completely to ourselves for about half an hour. The employee gave great directions and showed us several examples and sample products. She showed us where all the supplies were located and then left us to our projects. This was my daughter's first time at a pottery painting place and she loved it. They have a wide variety of items to select with something to fit any budget. Speaking of budget, we also learned that they have special days that they waive their fees or that you can get discounts on pottery. You can find the calendar of specials as well as events in the store or on their website. Turn around time to pick up was 4 days for us. We didn't need our items urgently, but it's worth keeping in mind that you won't be walking away with a finished product that same day. Plan ahead if you're making something as a gift and need it by a certain date. We were very happy with the final appearance of our items. It was also a lot of fun, so we'll plan to return!",5
6132,"Ny did an amazing job on my gel manicure today. She took her time and went above and beyond of what I asked. Everyone there was super sweet, the lady who did my toes did an amazing job as well, $26 for a pedicure, you can't beat that!! Be sure to call and make a reservation they get pretty busy. 
I'm definitely making this my new nail home",5
6134,"One of the restaurants in the valley that I stop by to frequently. Great prices, great service and always awesome food. Being that Flo's started in Arizona, I love it that much more! Crab Wantons & Southeast Asian Peanut Chicken",5
6135,"This place was EXCELLENT! While I was craving comfort food and went straight for their pepperoni pizza, my dinner mates each ordered steaks. For appetizers, we had the meat and cheese platter and the spinach and artichoke dip (one of my favorite appetizers, so I get it almost everywhere... This place gets first prize. It was incredible). Three of us split two sides, the creamed corn and the mac n cheese, and it was enough for all of us to go with our well-portioned meals.

Their motto is something like ""simple food done right"", and I truly can't agree with that statement more. Everything I tried from here was top notch and hands down one of the best things I'd ever tried, but nothing was over complicated.

For dessert, none of us could decide which one we wanted the most... so we each got two. Overall at our table we had the orange bar, the peanut butter cheesecake, the panna cotta, the s'mores, the champagne shaved ice, and the passion fruit mousse. Each one was delicious in its own way (and the dessert portions were small enough to merit two desserts each). My favorite ended up being the passion fruit mousse. 

My only gripe was the server. I'm not sure if this is a restaurant-wide policy or if it was just our server who did this, but any time we would ask about an item on the menu (""Are the sides large enough to share? How is the Waygu beef aged?"") She would answer our question and then list off her favorites from that section of the menu (even though we never asked for suggestions)... And because we had questions about each major section, I could walk in there right now and order an entire meal for her from start to finish. She was very nice, but that kind of information wasn't asked for, nor was it relevant to anything we did ask.",5
6136,"A technician arrived less than an hour after I called!  He quickly inspected the door and let us know that the spring was broken.  He replaced the spring in less than an hour.  He was kind, polite and courteous.  We found MasterCraft Doors here on Yelp.  

We almost made the mistake of going with the first company that showed up on Google.... that company has many 1 star reviews!  

Thank you Yelp!!!",5
6137,These guys are awesome. I needed a decal on the back of my car and they worked with me until I got what I want.  Then after I had it for several days I noticed a mistake.  I had signed off on it.  I called and they said no problem and fixed it within 1 day free of charge.  Thats customer service!,5
6138,Been to Ronnie's 3 times and every single time I felt like I got a lot of food for a small price. People are friendly.what more is there to say?,5
6139,"This place was AMAZING!!!! We ordered a Nutella with strawberries crepe, a cheesecake crepe with strawberries and mango, and macaroons....... They were all sensational!!!! It is a large crepe and he filled it with TONS of fruit!!! When we come back to Vegas this will be our first stop when we leave the airport. The staff was so friendly.
!!!!",5
6140,Best Price Movers were awesome! We used 3 guys today to move our 5 bedroom house AND had to drive to Gastonia from Harrisburg but they knocked it out so quick. They handled our stuff with such care too!! I can't thank Frank and his team of really nice and polite guys enough for making this dreadful task so easy on me and my family.,5
6142,"We went for a late dinner with some friends and when I say late, I mean, 45 minutes before closing. The staff was so accommodating and friendly. 
For the four of us, we got 3 naans, one order of Nihari (beef chunks in a stew), haleem (a dish made of slow cooked meat, lentils and spices) and a Kashmiri tea. 
The food portions were generous and we were quite stuffed. 
Nihari: the beef was so tender and the flavor really penetrated the chunks with the naan soaking up all the delicious sauce. 
Haleem: although we couldn't find it on the menu, the waiter said they had it and it was better than expected. The meat, lentils and spices were cooked so long that they had blended into each other. It was soooo good. I would recommend asking for some fresh ginger, cilantro and lime on the side to freshen it up a bit. Still, quite delicious. 
The waiters bring by chill is that are grilled and salted. One of the 4 got a spicy one but they are generally 'jalape√±o' level of spice if you're ok with that. There is a bottle of yoghurt sauce and tamarind sauce on the table that I would imagine goes well with biryani or samosas. Will go back!",5
6143,I went to this shop today because i needed a new catalytic converter and they got me in right away I'd say within 20 minutes they were done with everything they seemed very friendly and gave a great price over the phone with no hidden fees and they charged me what they quoted me and didn't try to hassle me for any other work i might not have needed like some other places I've been to. I'd recommend these guys to anyone. Thank you advanced muffler,5
6145,"Went tonight with a party of 4 kids and 4 adults. Service was great start to finish, prices were totally fair, and the food was surprisingly good. Special thanks to employee, Bryant. He was so polite and helpful (especially when my son spilled an entire glass of water everywhere). I can guarantee we will be back regularly. Might have to plan an adult party or two ;)",5
6146,"My girlfriend and I came here for a Valentine's Day dinner. The ambiance, d√©cor, service, drinks and food was amazing and quite upper crust (It's a good thing)! Top notch. We opted for the special, limited Valentine's Day menu and we were not disappointed. My steak was cooked perfect and the desserts were divine! We will definitely be back to experience more options on the menu. I suggest this restaurant if you want to take a loved one out for a date night or special occasion.",5
6147,"Everything we ordered was delicious! Stuffed French toast, works veggie Benny. Our server Alexa our server was attentive and kind. Really everyone here is super friendly. Great place for breakfast off the beaten path.",5
6148,"We decided to give this restaurant a try to celebrate my fathers 88th birthday. We sat out on the magnificent terrace (with heaters) and had one of the most enjoyable dinning experiences in Scottsdale.
Where to begin? Our waiter Tyler was so pleasant and professional. He recommended a few dishes and we ended up trying 16 I'm total for 5 of us. The quality of the ingredients, the presentation and taste was faultless. We all found the dishes to be reasonably priced and each one was absolute heaven. We chose 5 vegetables and it's the first time in AZ that the Brussels have been cooked perfectly. Blanched and then grilled. The bison carpaccio is so delicate. The lamb tacos truly scrumptious. The bass was a true highlight. All is so fresh that it is hard to really have a winner! The chicken flatbread was my mother's preferred choice (she only eats chicken!!!)
Upon parking they asked the reason for the visit and one of the 5 desserts arrived with a personal birthday message. Wonderful touch to a truly magical evening. Thank you to everyone and especially the Chef who took the time to come out and meet us. I think she was truly impressed by the quantity of food we ordered. She's worked under Brinkley but I truly believe the food on offer tonight was far superior to her place of training.",5
6151,"One of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh. Certainly a hidden gem. I of course have to comment on the absolute delicious wedding soup. It's hard to find good wedding soup in a restaurant; it's usually either bland or too salty. But Big Jim's gets it just right. They're other dishes are equally yummy and the portions are always huge. Love the pasta with white clam sauce - so many clams!  Have also eaten the gnocchi but ordered it with a marinara rather than the meat sauce. They took a bit long to cook but were well worth the wait. Also, all pasta dishes come with a yummy warm and buttery garlic toast! Have also tried steak sandwich and the premium grilled chicken sandwich which are both also good. The bread is fabulous. 

Have never been hungry enough for dessert but I'm sure it would rock.",5
6152,"We rented out the Barrymore for our Wedding in May of 2017. From day 1, the service was unmatched. I had reached out to numerous places in vegas and most were unwilling to compromise and/or had pushy sales people. Kuuipo at the Barrymore was a godsend. She was kind, thoughtful and extremely helpful from the very first contact. The venue is absolutely beautiful and the food is to die for! We were treated like royalty by the entire staff. I've never experienced service like that at any restaurant or venue and I work in that industry. The cost is very reasonable for the level of service and quality of food. We were truly blown away and our wedding went off perfectly. They even sent us a thank you card and cookies from Hawaii (were we had our hooneymoon). Thank you to Kuuipo and the entire Barrymore staff for making our dreams a reality and supporting us along the way!",5
6153,"This restaurant blows,  the staff were sllooowwwwwww as possible, we had to make a scene to get them to open our wine - when they finally did - they gave all 11 of us a 'taste' even when we had ordered more than one bottle,  they did 'plate' the table all at once (one star)  They restaurant was attractive (one star) the food was good (two stars) - but then the ^&*#  hit the fan when they overcharged us by almost $400 on an $1100 bill.   (minus 3 stars) (we had to send the bill back twice)-  It is kind of a crime when the auto ding you 18% tip when the staff really, (I mean actually) was terrible.   If you want to eat at MGM go to Mon Ami Gabi - the french place - get steak eat outside and watch the fountains at the Bellagio across the street.",1
6156,"Loved this place! I had the Cuban which was awesome, and my wife had the fried chicken which was perfectly cooked. We'll be back!",5
6158,"Absolutely fantastic. The fish is fresh. The restaurant has a great feel but is way cheaper than traditional sushi. The value for a Medium and Large bowl is excellent.

The sushi combo with a bowl is a great deal as well. 

Try the black rice!

You can get a basic roll like Philadelphia or California for $5!

I know you care for a bowl but their sushi rolls were top notch and just as good as any local sushi restaurant. Genius idea. 

Eat here!!",5
6159,"I like to consider myself a pizza enthusiast. I am always looking for the best pizza wherever I go, and try to lean on trip advisor or yelp when locating the best. I've now spent a couple evenings over the last couple weeks in a place which I would consider to have the BEST pizza I have ever had outside of Italy. Sfizio is, unequivocally, my favorite pizza in Toronto. I've tried the rest of the so called ""best pizza"" restaurants in town, and I stand by my statement. I have had both the traditional Margherita pizza as well as my favorite, the Diavola (without olives, I'm not a monster). One word....perfection. Do yourself a favor and try this place out. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is perfect for either a date night or just a casual night out for a bite to eat. The rest of the menu looks authentic and delicious and there is a pretty nice wine list to pair with your meals. I will be sure to try many of the other dinner options in the coming weeks. Highly recommended!",5
6163,My second time here. The pastor tacos are under cooked. My huarache is so hard. They have really bad service. The cashier was mad. Never. NEVER COMING BACK.,1
6164,The food was good but the service was horrendous. I will NEVER be back! I can get delicious Italian food many places in Toronto and the GTA. This will not be it.,1

While I'm generally a Ronald's Donuts kind of guy for the regular stuff, when I'm in the mood for a twist or any of their fancy specialty donuts, there's no better place! This place has Pink Box beat by a country mile. Apparently they now have ice cream as well! Awesome! 

Make sure you get here early on the weekdays if you want something specific though, because they do sell out!",5
6169,this place was yummy! the MAGIC SHROOM burger is a must-have. also the french fries were unreal!!! Happy Hour ends at 6:30 M-F so get there early! service wasnt the best though -- we were routinely welcomed by the same person before we were seated and drinks took way too long,5
6172,"Awesome show!!! The performers were amazing, mesmerizing, and shocking. It was entertaining from beginning to end and I would highly recommend it.",5
6174,Loved it! Well worth the money!!! From beginning to end--it was nonstop entertainment! We were even given our own pots and drumsticks to participate.,5
6175,I got my first tattoo today with Sean and I couldn't be happier with it. The place is very clean with a professional atmosphere and the artist took his time on the sketch to make sure it was perfect before starting. If I get another tattoo I'll be back.,5
6176,Terrible communication no office just voice mail which mailbox is full emailing them is slow and asking multiples times to call me back I still have not heard from them. Once they got initial booking they just left me in the dark. Seems to be one man operation .,1
6177,"This place stole our money- was dirty and had no one on duty. You have to put your cash money into a machine to get ""tokens"" to make the wash and vacuums work..and conveniently- the machine didn't work- but kept our money! Pathetic Canadian business at its best- dirty, under staffed and a waste of money.",1
6179,"This place is truly a hidden gem. I've never been to a place like this!

So it's basically Japanese chipotle. I'm not a big sushi eater, so this place is actually perfect for me! I always order the bowls with teriyaki chicken and I'm able to get any kind of vegetables and sauces I want! They even have yum-yum sauce like Hibachi restaurants! When my brother comes to visit he always loves coming here!

The employees are super nice and helpful and the pricing isn't too bad. Come give this place a try!",5
6184,"Shout out to Tony, Britney and Theresa plus all the other staff at Elixir. Everyone is helpful and friendly. Last night my husband and I ordered the crab balls and the meatballs and both tasted great. The games seem to be paying out really well right now, too. Husband and I came on opening night, I came back on Sunday and then Husband and I went back again last night. The staff really make the place but it is also a really pretty space and I didn't notice a smell of smoke anywhere. We are not smokers.",5

6191,This place is terrible.   It took me at least 30 minutes to get my drinks.  I ordered chicken nachos at 7:45 at 8:45 I canceled my order because it still had not arrived.   Pricey drinks. No never again.   Never!!! If I could give a negative star I would.,1
6192,"I had just received a new uniform shirt via FedEx last Thursday 1/31/13. I had to have some patches added to it as well as epaulets & a badge holder. I thought about driving up to Carolina Pavilion but happened to be passing Carmel Commons. I spotted Hengs and decided to go there instead. I had met the owners last year while I had been stationed at the shopping center & they were very personable people. The store had been full of people eager to have them work on their clothing. That's the best recommendation that I know.

Anyhow I brought the shirt in on Saturday afternoon 2/2/13, explained what I wanted done & asked to pick it up on Monday. I have to say that everything looked like it had been added at the factory. The price was very reasonable as well. Will I return to Carolina Pavilion, probably not. I think that Hengs will be my go to store for clothing repairs.",5

6195,"I went back to return a bra that I bought two of. After wearing it the bra didn't fit well. The wire pokes me and the cup had lots of spillage. I was very disappointed. I spoke to the manager and she was actually who was surprised at how an employee acted in my last review. She sized me and said I was coming up as the same size they said previously but assured her I was an H and that is why the G that was my ""size"" was not fitting. 

She eventually was like ""yeah we don't carry anything higher than a 40G"" well why waist my time!? Back to Dillards I go, they always help me or send me home if they don't have what I need. Soma recommended I check Macy's..... MACYS ONLY FORS TO DDD. Smh. Keeping a customer for a dollar when you know it isn't a fit is a bad business model. 

So one star for soma. Way to waste my time and my money then ask me to return. Smh smh smh.",1
6196,"Let me start by saying WOW!!!
Can you imagine a place where they just keep bringing you more and more of the best food?  This is it!
The sirloin and ribeye were awesome.  Defiantly a cut above your normal steakhouse.  Then they brought out the bacon wrapped filet.  I was in heaven...until they brought out the filet (without bacon)!  This is by far the best cut of meat I have ever eaten.
I can't say enough about this place and would go back in a heart beat!!!
And then the molten chocolate cake was delish!",5
6197,"WOW amazing!

Busker fest brings buskers from all over the world and to entertain Torontonians with their wide range of talents.

BUSKERS
My favourite was definitely ""StuntDouble Circus""
http://www.stuntdoublecircus.com/

They were acrobatics that were really entertaining. Their skit had 5 sections and there was audience interaction. Their show was very fast paced and kept wowing the audience.  They nailed every act and were very gracious for donations given to them.

They even gave a free t-shirt for each $20 donation. (There are 4 guys and so they would have to split each donation 4 ways)

Some other buskers seemed to have a chip on their shoulder like the audience owed them something.  I guess it's difficult not knowing how much money people will donate and having your life depend on other people's decisions....wait a sec... all jobs are like that to a degree.


FEE
It was FREE!! And you could choose to donate to the event. This year they were supporting epilepsy.

I think this notion of having the event free is better because then the audience feels more inclined to donate to the performers since they are not being paid by the festival.

It was a very enjoyable evening and I will definitely go next year.",5
6200,"I think I love Dunkin because it's so damn inaccessible.

My first experience with Dunkin was probably 10 years ago when friends from Boston brought Dunkin ground coffee to LA with them.  I liked the cinnamon-y taste it had.
While my boyfriend and I were in Delaware, we started every morning with an iced coffee.  From there I was hooked.

When I come to Vegas, I make it a point to locate the nearest Dunkin.  This location is 24 hours.",5
6202,"They are open now!  Pleasant dining experience (minus the hot weather and flies).  Outdoor seating only and pet friendly.  Seasonal menu is fresh and food I had was really good!  Very fresh eggs.  One of the best breakfast I had in a while...  4 stars for food.  5 stars for being original, eco-friendly and supporting local growers.",5
6203,"This is a nice little bar that offers restaurant seating that makes for a great meet up spot for clients or friends. They offer a decent selection of beer on tap and the staff is friendly and remembers you quickly. They have specials on their food and have a good variety of the bar favorites and some not so usual treats like their stuffed avocado or calves liver dinner. They have the usual multi plasma set up with different sports games on each screen. The bar area has decent seating all around and their bar machines are not too tight( I've won my tab back on more than a few occasions) if they make any mistakes on your meal orders they don't hesitate to correct the problem and set things straight. All in all this is a great place with great service and good food, 5 stars in my book.",5
6204,"Great experience. Drew was our range master. We fired the BAR, Tommy gun, AK, AR, MP5 and Uzi. He was friendly, explained everything clearly and was very helpful. Drew kept the event fun and safe. The selection of firearms is crazy. They have it all!!  I'll make sure I return next time I am in Vegas!!",5
6209,"Very rude makeup manager, they do not offer small samples to try at home. Thank god they have a return policy. I was forced to buy something for New Years Eve so I could have foundation for the night and will be returning it since they were so rude to me. Will always make sure to shop at Sephora since they are helpful and let you take home samples to try on at home.",1
6210,"Being from New York I am very selective about my pizza. This place is up there with quality as I had their mac n' cheese pizza and it was outstanding. The service is fast, friendly and the venue has plenty of room to sit. They were also opened on Easter Sunday which I thought was fantastic and I would recommend this place to anyone.",5
6211,Staff is very friendly and attentive. My first week bringing my pup here and my j.r.t had no problems with other dogs. Staff plays with them and makes sure they are properly cared for. Another plus side is they also have a live feed camera so you can check up on your pup!,5
6212,"I had a prime rib steak, and wow it was amazing. It came with bone marrow and that tasted even better! My friends uncle took us and we had a server named Juan, he was a great sever. He was very patient, kind, and informative, I suggest you ask for him. Although the whole staff was nice and attentive, no one there was slacking off. I will not only go back for the mouth dropping food, but also for the amazing staff.",5
6213,We live in Sun City and after looking into various solar companies we settled on Arizona Solar Solutions and have been extremely happy with our decision. Rich who was our main contact has been wonderful to deal with as has every person we have dealt with.  Everything went smoothly and we could not be happier.,5
6216,"Food was awesome and the atmosphere is just as amazing! If you want something with a casual cool vibe this is the place to go for margaritas and guacamole! Food...can't go wrong. We had to go twice during our stay. 

The only issue is that we don't have one in New Jersey!!!",5
6217,"Honestly this place really let me down and missed the mark. what a bummer. definately wont return.

this is a Mexican place.. they dont bring chips to the table. 

No kids menus. no kids crayons or papers to draw on.

ok, ok, I can live with that

but the food is food-truck mediocre (at best) at restaurant prices... and the service was HORRIBLE.

seriously the worst service I have received from anywhere in a long time. 

super disappointed, and as a life long Mexican food fan... I wont be back.",1

The food was excellent the service was prompt and attentive without being pretentious. 

We had feta, lamb and calamari and all of it was great.  
The portions are large and prices are reasonable considering what you get. 

Both my girl friend and I are looking forward to going back.",5
6223,Ordered the Toro sashimi and it was the worst piece of sushi I've had in a long time. A sushi chef should never allow that poor of quality of sushi to be served. It was chewy and fishy. Freshness and Quality get a F!,1
6225,"Beautiful decor and  crowd is mixed. We had a reservation for 8 PM on a Thursday night. We arrived 10 minutes before and the hostess told us that our reservation was for 8:15 which was not true because i booked it and said 8 PM. She said we can only sit in the lounge area where we can only have drinks, no appetizers. This was a completely wasted birthday dinner. It was 8:23 PM we decided to leave since there was no signs of that table being available. When the hostess realized that we are leaving she said she can offer us crackers!?!? :) Anyways the manager was there and saw the whole thing, didn't say anything seemed he didn't care. Food might be good, I can't say but service was horrible. It on of those cool, fancy looking places that you go in but the staff is cold and arrogant and you just want to get up and leave.",1
6226,"This hotel is an atrocity! Please stay away!!!! Do NOt stay here I repeat don't stay here! The floor is totally unstable and uneven as if the building has structural issues , the floor carpet is pulled up, the floor is stained, the vanity was falling off the wall, the a/c cover was falling off displaying a disgusting filter. The room smelt disgusting and there was a dirty sanitary pad in the washroom. Please see attached pics. 

Toby at the front desk was great however and kept the husband from jumping over the front desk in rage lol.",1
6228,"Chimney cleaning- A+

6231,"I was accosted and harassed by hookers so many times I lost count. Was pick pocketed and scammed in the elevator. There is no security making sure that only guests are going to the floors like most other hotels here have. When I checked in the first room has literally every piece of furniture damaged and first thing I see is a roach scurry across bathroom. Oh and the concave sagging bed. I complained and was switched to a much nicer but smaller room. When I complained about the hookers in the elevators and pick pocketing I was told ""welcome to Vegas"" and the apologetic staff stated that there was nothing they could do for me or about the problems.",1
6233,"The service is pretty mediocre. But not all servers are. I just got really unlucky. Tables next to me came after me and ordered after me. Yet all three of them got the meals before and when I asked my server about it, she had an attitude. I fly LA - Toronto once a month and always at this terminal. Will not eat here again.",1

My friend and I stayed in a double room together. My friend booked the room in her name and thank God for the Mobile Check In otherwise we would have probably waited 30 + minutes to check in as the line was horrendous!  

Our room was really nice and clean. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable - even the housekeeping staff spoke to us as we were walking down the hall to our room. I would definitely stay at The Mirage again in the near future.",5

6240,"I was completely skeptical about Phoenix Ranch Market when my wife said we were going to go check it out last week, so skeptical that I told her I didn't want to go, in all honesty... what could possibly be so good about a little grocery store in a not particularly good part of downtown Phoenix after all? EVERYTHING. Prices lower than Walmart, the largest selection of 89 cent pastries I've ever seen, several small ""restaurants"", full cows heads for only 49.99, a vast selection of specialty items most grocery stores don't carry much of (Hispanic stuff, fruits, vegetables), plus, it's probably the most clean grocery store I've ever been in. While we don't live close enough to make this our go-to grocery store, I can guarantee you'll see us here several times a month from now on. Five big fat ones for sure.",5

I mainly dealt with Alex and not once did he try to upsell me or get me to drop more money than needed... He even gave me a ride to work! Best part is Sterling (My Car) passed Emissions!!!!

6245,"In Montreal for a Bachelor party and walking away from the Hell that is the Time Supper Club. Devastated that our fabulous weekend had just been completely ruined in the span of 30 minutes, we trudged dejectedly back to our hotel. We had thrown in the towel, we were done, we were ready to go to bed, to end our weekend right then. 

However God was smiling down on us this night. As we walked my dad glanced to his left and noticed Vargas. ""Hey guys I read this morning that, that place is a pretty good steakhouse"". Having not eaten we decided to give it a shot, what did we have to loose? 

Walking up to the door we could smell the steak in the air. Pulling the door a wonderful sound washed over us, after the godawful pounding Techno music at Time SC, could it really be? ... it was Old Blue Eyes crooning from the speakers. Never before or since have I been happier to hear Sinatra. Looking at my best friends I simply muttered ""I think we're gonna be OK here."" I didn't know at that moment but I've never been more right. 

We were seated almost immediately, moments later we had bottles of wine of the table. We ordered appetizers, the calamari & the stuffed portabella mushrooms, absolutely fabulous! 

Now for the main course, Porterhouse, all around. Outside of Peter Luger's it was the best steak I've ever had. Barclay Prime, Del Frisco's, Ruths Chris, Morton's, The Palm, they can all take a back seat to this steak from Vargas. 

Perfectly seasoned with a Montreal Style steak spice. It had been grilled to a perfect medium. I savoured every bite. I probably would've eaten the plate. It was that good. 

In conclusion Vargas single handedly saved one of the greatest weekends we've ever had together from ending on a terrible note. If that's not worth 5 stars then nothing is. In fact I give it 6.",5
6246,"Totally, totally, totally confused by some of the negative reviews on here. My partner and I went last night--it was our first visit and were celebrating our anniversary--and had the best restaurant experience EVER. Very special and very memorable.


FOOD
We decided to do the 12 course tasting menu with drink pairings. The price was steep ($115 for food, $50 for drinks, $165 total per person) but absolutely worth it. I'm not going to go through and review each course we had because it would be way too much, but each and every course was simply delicious. The dishes and recipes were unique and original. Great for foodies and very chef driven. Presentation was absolutely spectacular--there is no competition.

In addition to the twelve courses, we were surprised with what's called a ""revisit"" -- we each got to choose a course that we would like to experience again. It was a wonderful surprise and something neither of us had ever heard of. 

The chef came out after completing the tasting menu. It meant a lot that he took the time to speak with us about the food and our experience. 

Highlights:
- two little balls of duck and goat cheese served on a GIANT wooden block
- beef heart tartare
- mushroom soup with the broth poured table side
- pasta with ricotta and lemon zest
- pasta with animal fat that melted and tasted like gravy
- roasted turnips with watermelon radish and salsa verde
- cranberry sorbet with yogurt and granola
- Prosecco gummies with a surprise inside...
- bread served with an edible candle - you dip your bread in it as it melts
- cappelletti spritz garnished with an Ohio-grown apple slice
- red effervescent wine


SERVICE
P-H-E-N-O-M-E-N-A-L. Outstanding. Our server Sarah was the best server we have ever had. Fun, nice, personable, and most importantly, knowledgeable. The food runner was knowledgeable as well, describing every dish and explaining the ingredients and cooking techniques.


AMBIENCE
I was legitimately shocked at the size of this restaurant. It's tiny. I thought there was more seating upstairs - nope. I think there were maybe ten tables total. It's small, but cozy and intimate. Modern, classy, contemporary decor. You must check out the bathrooms - super high tech! 


Most definitely recommend.",5
6249,"I've been eating at this sushi restaurant for years and I have never been disappointed. Of course, my favorite is Chirashi Sushi. It is fairly expensive as it is many different kinds of sashimi on a bed of sticky rice and you need a big Appetite, is difficult to finish there is so much of it. All of it, very fresh, all of it delightful. I highly recommend it to a others. It also doesn't hurt to acknowledge the service with a very polite thank you and please in Japanese. I've never had a bad experience with them at all.",5
6250,"By far the worst Robertos I have been to.  Ordered four items, two of the items were wrong.  Order a chicken chimichanga and got beef.

I dragged my boyfriend from his comfy nest and persuaded him to join. He and I both have great places we enjoy sushi and Kaya is one of them. (One of the best in Las Vegas) After trying Umiya it has immediately become my favorite. Although the service and dining experience as a whole is very very fast, I enjoyed the food and the attentive service. The types of rolls were damn near specialty and all looked so amazing!!! You know when you try ""All You Can Eat"" just to try bits and pieces everything and share? Well, we ordered doubles of the same thing and literally stuff our faces! And everything was unique and tasty! It was a taste bud overload! I don't remember much of the names of rolls but my favorite was the roll with the lightly fried banana on top. Like, who thinks of that?! It was delicious!!! I ordered it twice!!! From now on I will recommend Umiya over Kaya, but both are unique in their own ways. I lean more towards Umiya since they have an edge. A very sharp one atm.",5

Either they're using spoiled milk or not putting in enough Chai concentrate. I don't know, but the drink always tastes funky from this location.",1
6269,Their half pound burger was excellent. The buns were also perfect. The wedge fries completed the experience---although it would've been better with the In-N-Out fries. The service was fast and friendly. Definitely makes the top 5 of my list of favorite burgers. Will definitely come back if in the area.,5
6270,"It's very busy, and we wait for 30 minuets to order the meal. Also, service is too bad, no one served to us before I called someone to order the food even if there are not to much customer in store.

The vibe definitely reminded me of being in Hawaii. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!",5

You can get in and out in ten minutes, recommendations in hand, including tire rotation and replacement or alignment.",5
6274,"I have been here 2 times now, and I have enjoyed the dishes that I have ordrred. The owner is very personable and the food comes out hot and fresh. Prices are also very reasonable. My husband loves the won ton soup but will try the pho since it's a specialty. I love the grilled pork on rice. We love the fact that we don't have to drive to Spring Mountain.",5
6275,"What an amazing meal. Started with big eye tuna (my favorite menu item), roasted mussels, salt & pepper lobster, amazing salad and ended with crack pie. Sat at the grill area and it's the best seat in the house. Chef Steve was great and I quickly made friends with other food enthusiasts at the grill. Ended up sharing plates with a videographer from CNN....totally cool and fun night!",5

The server let the manager know so the manager came back to explain to us that our palettes were the issue. I didn't want to argue and I let him know I'd leave my opinion on yelp he got very defensive and asked if this was a threat? He wouldn't let me leave till I somehow agreed that the food was good but I had a different taste preference. Ok sushi horrible service",1

6285,"I don't know why I keep giving their service department another chance.  This is the last time I will ever step foot in Earnhardt's.  Asked for an oil change and recommended fluid flushes on my 2005 - transmission, differential, power steering - and was presented with a $6000+ quote for everything from tires to suspension to a tune-up and more.  And to top it off, I was told that sadly, with the amount of work needed on this vehicle, it might be better to just trade it in and buy a new one - from Earnhardt of course.   Interesting strategy to sell vehicles, but it just cost them a customer and created an ambassador (me) to tell everyone I know that this company is nothing more than a scam.  I should have quit 20 years ago when the location on Baseline ""borrowed"" the keys to my car while I was car shopping (sir, we need to move your vehicle) and wouldn't give them back for a half hour while they continued giving me the hard sell.  Oldest trick in the book and I fell for it. Never again Earnhardt.",1

We walked down the street to get married by the commissioner (walk ins only on Sunday). Waited ten minutes for the couple before us to finish their ceremony, paid the $75 fee, and it wasn't ten minutes later we were officially hitched. The commissioner said that since we did it with the state that we should have our official certificate ready by Tuesday morning. She was right - it was ready Tuesday. We went back to the marriage license bureau, walked up to the kiosk, paid $15, and we had our official certificate in hand. Easy peasy.",5

I ordered the standard Shack Burger even though I wanted the Shack Stack (but since we had a class afterwards, I didn't want to risk nausea or worse, throwing up from eating too closely to exercising.  Since both of us did not care of In N Out fries the day before (we already knew that going in) and ended up throwing away a lot of fries, we decided to share one order of fries between us here.  The fries are SO MUCH BETTER.  They are crispy crinkle-cut style.  Yum.  They were fresh and not soggy (from sitting around) at all.  It was still a good idea to share an order, though.  The quality of burger was really excellent and I'm one who can be kind of picky about that stuff.  Yum.  

My friend ordered the Shack Stack and it looked amazing!!!!  She said it was super good but left a couple of bites uneaten because she was too full.  She had also ordered a shake with it, so that would explain it.  I liked the sizes of the shakes and floats - very moderate and not outrageous.  I prefer quality over quantity.  I went with the root beer float since I wanted a taste of their custard but not a whole shake (again the whole heavy foods right before exercising thing).  I would come here again!",5

6292,"Ah...where to begin?

Sage is a treasure. Hubs and I were treated to a trip to Vegas following our beautiful Sonoma County wedding (aka, our Honeymoon) in November 2011. I did a lot of research beforehand and used trusty Yelp to make my decision on where to dine for our ""fancy"" night out. (The word fancy always reminds me of Squidward for some reason).

I settled on Sage after much research into price, location, menu, and general Yelp happiness. I will say that their tasting menu and wine pairing were mostly what made me decide on this restaurant. Our close friends gave us a generous wedding gift certificate to Aria to assist with the cost as well, so needless to say, we were well on our way to maximum enjoyment.

We went early to expand our meal options since they offer another tasting menu for early diners. We started with a few martinis (Grey Goose dirty martini for me) while we soaked up the atmosphere. Posh is how I would describe it, and pleasantly lit. 

We had forgotten to go grab our gift certificate from the front desk, and the host went to grab it for us when my husband was getting up to grab it. When Hubs tried to tip him for the service, he refused the tip and said, ""just doing my job."" Big score for Sage's staff there.

Our waiter was very nice and attentive, which didn't change even when the restaurant got busier. We ended up ordering the $79 tasting menu with wine pairing. Hubs and I each got something different off the tasting menu so we could get the full scope of the menu. So happy that we did.

It's been about 8 months so I can't remember everything, but here were the highlights of the meal:

Bread: They had some bread that had bacon in it! To die for! Even better though (I know, how does it get better than bacon?) was the butter. It was lavender butter. Whipped and creamy and orgasmic. I was a little buzzed so I though nothing of sticking my finger in the bowl and cleaning up the tidbits that remained. I have never been so impressed with bread and butter.

Wagyu Beef Tartare: I've already used orgasmic so let's go with phenomenal on this. Seriously, I still have dreams of finding something this good ever again. A poached egg sits a top this yummy pile of raw meat and once pierced oozes its gooey goodness down into the rest of the goodness. What a treat!

Scallops: I don't remember exactly how they were prepared (the wine pairing is quite a doozy, fair warning), but I remember that they were really tasty. And not overcooked - which is a huge gripe I have over the preparation of scallops.

48 hour pork belly: Again, I'm going to blame this on the alcohol, but I don't remember too much here but that it was excellent (and we were getting very full). Hubs and I both ordered this one and yummed it all up.

And I honestly don't remember too much more than that. But hey, it's Vegas, right?

Everything was paced well and the staff had great patience for our slow going. Our waiter even sent the sommelier over to chat with us once when we mentioned that we were from Sonoma County and Hubs worked at a boutique winery in Russian River Valley.

Overall, great experience, staff, and food. The $400 price tag (including tip) was worth it.",5
6293,"First time to this theater. We saw It's a Wonderful Life. It was an amazing performance. I laughed, cried and was mesmerized by the performance. A very talented group with heart. I  recommend everyone visit this treasure. I will definitely return. Thank you for a great evening and a great way to kick off the holidays!",5
6294,"Some of the weirdest service from a food fight joint. My date and I literally felt like we were being talked about and laughed at...for whatever reason.

Honestly I don't get it..? The burgers tasted odd, and not what you would think from a place that bills them as the best. My milkshake tasted like dishwasher soap and was simply gross! 

Won't be back for half assed food and ODD BALL service.",1
6297,"There are so many things to recommend this shop. 1) The people who staff it are  kind, fun, helpful, and enthusiastic. 2) They encourage trying samples of everything 3) The flavours are gorgeous -- so much of the time ice cream is too sweet and not flavourful enough. That was not the case here. 4) there are multiple vegan offerings and they go beyond simple overly sweet fruit sorbets. 5) the ice creams are all made carefully and with great attention to flavour, texture, and ingredients. We were delighted with our visit, and we look forward to the next outing for ice-cream. What a wonderful, perfect treat. Highly recommend.",5
6298,"I had been eyeing the groupon they offer for two large sandwiches for $14.99 and last night was the perfect storm of circumstance and laziness so i popped in around 6:15 to a small wonderful smelling italian deli. A couple people were waiting for to-go orders and they were busy. The guy at the counter finished helping them then asked me what I would like. I mentioned my groupon and ordered the Philly and the Brooklyn. He mentioned it would be about 15 mins...""no problem"" I said as the smell in this place was awesome. About 15 minutes later he emerged with two GIGANTIC foil wrapped bombers. When i git home I enjoyed a QUARTER of each and Im a huge eater. The philly was very good but a tad dry and the Brooklyn cold cut sub was absolute $$$$$
 Fresh ingredients, huge portions, authentic prep, and a counter guy who knew almost every customers name but mine.....soon enough i think.",5
6300,"This Wendy's at the Charlotte airport is slamming!  I was there for a bite in between flights - Wendy's is seriously one of my favorite fast food outlets.  Like all chains, you have good locations and bad locations.  This location is seriously great!  The service was quick and personable - even in their rushing to serve the line of customers they had, both of the people I spoke with were genial and service oriented.  As most airport locations of chain restaurants, their menu is not the full offering.  The food was fantastic!  I ordered a single with cheese meal, replacing the fries with chili, which the staff accommodated without question as per the Wendy's routine.

I say if you find yourself in the Charlotte airport, needing some food - try the Wendy's!",5
6301,"I am giving this restraint five stars because of their amazing management staff, my Son came in recently to treat his brother and young sister to Lunch. They had a not so terrific experience, I won't go in to the details since the follow up was extremely exceptional. We came back to a red carpet service. We will come back and recommend this location to friends and family. It really goes to show you that Customer service is really in the heart of the management team and how they execute their training.",5
6304,"This is my Mexican go-to.  The tacos are always amazing, fresh and flavourful and delicious.  I love the soft corn tortillas, that have an authentic taste that I've rarely had outside of Mexico. You also literally cannot beat the price - $1.50 special tacos (even eating 3-5 tacos, that's a cheap dinner).  The service has always been great, too!  In the summer, they also open up the front of the restaurant so you can watch all of the college street activity.  It can sometimes be quite quiet inside, so don't be alarmed if you are the only one in the restaurant (or one of the only ones).  You're just one of the few who is taking advantage of a hidden gem!",5
6305,"If you want authentic Greek food, this place is where to go. Servings are huge, and the flavors are amazing. Not to mention a great staff. The garlic Feta fries are to die for. I always order the Lamb gyro plate. The salad is always fresh, the dressing not too tangy. Their rice alone is so good I could eat it by itself. The tzatziki sauce is one of the best I've ever tasted. This place continues to deliver quality food each time and never disappoints.",5
6306,"We took a cheap cab ride to Buffalo Wild Wings or B-Dubs as the locals call it.. It is kind of far from The Strip and not worth walking to unless you are that bored.  The great thing about B-Dubs are the sauces!  They have about 20 different flavors!  We ordered 24 Boneless Wings in Spicy Garlic and Medium Hot, Buffalo Chips, Fried Garlic Shrooms and some Fat Tires to drink.  It was waaaay too much food for two drunk people!  My favorite thing that we ordered were the Buffalo Chips!  They are not crispy but more like fries cut into little pieces of chip-like heaven.  Our bartender was really nice and made some great suggestions.  She was also from the Yay Area!  Our meal was really cheap too!  Another reason to hit up B-Dubs on your next trip to Vegas!",5
6307,"Our family has been going to Matta's since the early 90's and I can say they have changed a little since they closed the original location.  It's too bad that place had memory's and stories.  My sister loves this place and has carried three children into Matta's and the waitress from the original location got to see two of them grow.  So it's not only great food and fun but the staff and name are honest and true.  My favorites include Roberts tacos, chili relleno, and the hot sauce!",5

6313,"The Voodoo Chicken was so good that I ordered a second helping to-go for tomorrow. Set up a little like a deli, it's not super-fancy (which means no waiter to tip). The staff was super friendly, explained the spicy and non-spicy options, and offered samples right away. There was not a single marginal or overpriced menu item that I saw or tried. It was all excellent. Very unique for this area. All-in-all, it was a legit experience.",5
6316,Horrible. I don't even see how you people can think its good? I had once piece of California maki and almost puked. Their soups have no flavor and over priced one word horrid!,1

6323,"I was SOOO looking forward to it, and I was SOOO thouroughly disappointed! 

You might think that you are going to get something at least approaching a smoked meat sandwich with that thinly shaved, meaty, salty, nitrite filled goodness that you have come to expect from a smoked meat sandwich, with the meat bursting out from under the rye toast, but you'd be horribly, disappointingly, infuriatingly, wrong.

What you get instead is some disgustingly unappetizing, days old, thick cut ""something"" that consists at least 50% gristle, connective tissue and uncooked whitish fat... and you know beef fat isn't that appetizing to begin with ... But that is what you got to contend with.

The only redeeming part of this meal would be the crisp pickle. Or the option to throw it right back in the vendor's face (if that were legal. which it should be in this case.)

I would suggest that you stay clear of this truck and if you really have a hankering for street meat, go look for one of those disgusting sausages at any corner hotdog vendor ... Believe me, you'll get better value for your $3.50 canadian there than you would here for three times the price.

You've been warned.",1
6324,Had a Reuben here last night and it was the most disgusting Reuben I've ever had. Their corned beef is so unbelievably processed it was like cold rubber Bologna. Their quesadillas are on point though.,1
6325,"Great beer and really good food. Done. Review over. Go try this place :)

Yes, I really liked C'est What. They have two different types of October Fest cask ales on draft; and they're local... come on now. Just great and the staff is friendly too.",5
6326,"I love Baskin-Robbins. Maybe it's because I grew up on it, but their ice cream seems to make a bad day good and a good day even better. Anytime I go in with the kids they have the best time as well. The staff is very friendly and they are always eager to discuss the different flavors and let you sample them as well. This location is always clean with plenty of seating both inside and out.",5
6327,"This place was amazing. The GM Nick hospitality was next level. The service was attentive without being over bearing and the exec chef Jamal is crazy good at his job. The hummus appetizer was incredible. I know, hummus. Somehow, they turn it into a creamy masterpiece. We had the farm salad- fresh with great flavor, skirt steak with chimichurri, and the branzino. The Brandi o cooked with the skin on over a mesquite grill was the best I've ever had. Most everything is cooled over a fresh mesquite grill, as Jamal is from Texas, which keeps it healthy. No big sauces or anything to distract from the flavor of the meat or fish. Finished the meal with a snifter of 100 yr grand mariner. An amazing feast that I will definitely revisit when I come back to Vegas.",5
6328,"Excellent mediterranean food. Definitely the best in henderson. Their hummus is one of the best, if not the best I have tried so far in henderson.",5
6331,"This place is ridiculous.  For the record, the view is really nice and worth seeing, but the food is atrocious.  It's not that the ideas for a particular dish aren't interesting, it's that the meats, cuts, and vegetables are flavorless and/or terrible.  For a $35 salmon dish, the salmon dish was farmed!  Farmed salmon at a restaurant like this!  What are they trying to pass off on us?!?  Moreover, the wine list was terrible.  

So the view may be good but if I remember correctly, you go to restaurants for food.  But, apparently the restaurateurs who conceived the elements don't subscribe to this philosophy.",1
6338,"Been going here for years. Love their crispy spring rolls and their rare beef Pho soup. I can easily finish a small, but if you're really hungry go for a medium. Take out is easy and ready within 15 minutes usually. Friendly staff and consistently good - I've never had something I didn't like!",5

6343,"I took my car in a few weeks ago and the computer system they have couldn't read it my key.So,I waited 3 hours just for them to tell me they couldn't  do anything without the key read. So, I booked an appointment for the 24th with the rep Dawn.  Well, Dawn was off that day and I was severely annoyed because I was sure the new rep that was going to assist me was going to have no clue about the previous visit.  So, of course he (Shadow) didn't. Shadow  did the same trouble shooting as before but told me not to worry it would be fixed by the time I was off from work. Not only did he give me his assurance everything would be taken care of he kept me informed all day of the status of my card. I told him I'm unable to have my phone at work and he said he'd leave messages keeping me updated.  
 In addition to his attentiveness, and quick resolve  he also took time out to show me a few special features that I didn't know about my car. I will continue to  take my car here because of the exceptional customer service provided by ""shadow"" thank you so much!",5

6350,"I was on vacation in Arizona when a buddy of mine asked if i wanted to go to a very good Mediterranean place called Babylon Gyros. I told him yeah and im glade i did because this place is delicious! First of all the customer service is great and they have what is called a Babylon Burger in which you get a monstrous burger with gyros meat and all the condiments you like. They top it off with what is called taziki sauce and it sure is good! Before i left Arizona I had to go back to Babylon Gyros one more time. This time i had a combination plate with Chicken and Beef kabob with rice and a side salad. It also was very good and i had to eat everything on my plate even though i was full from all the food you get. Price is very fair and If anyone is looking for a really good restaurant, then this is the place.",5

6352,"I go to Fry's all the time however this particular Fry's is the worst.  I was stopping there often since it is conveniently on my way home.  The checker's are very rude.  Obviously they don't want to be there.  1 got really crappy with me about getting out my card even though I was trying to empty my basket.   I even witnessed 1 checker yell at the woman behind me (YELL LOUD AND RUDE) because she was the ""15 items or less lane"".  Which, by the way, the woman only had 9 items in her basket.  3 of them were large but still, very embarassing.

The lady felt so bad and called us back and offered us a discount on the next order which we really appreciated and she even offered to hold the food for us if we wanted.  Honestly, even though we got the wrong order, the food we got was still very fresh and delicious.  It was clean and not oily, very flavourful and cooked to perfection.  So even with the slight mishap, we still have to give them a full 5 stars!!  We will order again- they are our new favourite go too!  Thank you Dumpling House for the great food and humble service!",5
6358,"My husband and I had a great experience. We purchased a Groupon and made a reservation for 6:30 on a Friday night. We were immediately seated. The staff was attentive and friendly.  The food was served hot and slightly before we finished the last serving. I will add that they might want to think about expanding the salad bar. I would recommend them.

6360,The dumplings here are amazing.  Parsley (think it's cilantro which I love) with pork are so good we ended up ordering a second plate of them.  Got pan fried and used a combination of soya sauce and their hot sauce with chilis that is homemade - amazing.  Not fancy decor but the people are so sweet.  Make sure you stop here while in Toronto.,5
6361,"For their pool only: AMAZING! It was a great place to hang out, because it wasn't as crowded as the pool parties all around Vegas. We got a cabana (which was less expensive as said pool party locations), and had the best time! The whole area is pretty new and lavish. The servers and bouncers were so fun! I would go back here in a heartbeat!

Note: To get here, you walk through the Miracle Mile shops and over toward the SW part of the loop. Just keep walking in your bikini and heels, Vegas style. You'll find it. :)",5

I had some scratches and a dent from where someone hit my car (it's under 2 years old) and previously received quotes of upwards of $2000, CP Auto Body fixed everything for under $700! 

They polished my car so nicely and even detailed the inside of it for me. It honestly looks better than the day I bought it! 

I would highly recommend this business without hesitation, A+++ service! I can't thank you enough for such an affordable and worthwhile service - I no longer have to feel embarrassed about driving around with a dent in the side of my car :)",5

I recommend him without hesitation! =)",5

6372,"5 working days later and my item ( needed for an event tomorrow) hasn't even been processed! Wth? They state 1-2 days processing and up to 4 days shipping. It should be arriving tomorrow at the latest. 
And no email to apologise for the delay. Nothing. I had to write to customer service. 
""We have more orders than usual...... Blah blah blah"". You have my money! If you can't hold up your end of the contract you're a fraud. Don't enter into business.
Shop somewhere else. I certainly won't ever shop with them again. Don't B.S your customers ssense",1
6373,"I have to agree with everything Wade F. said. The service was slow, skimpy portions, excessive sweet sauce applied to sushi. You barely see the fish in the white tuna roll. Most of the fried dishes was over cooked and dry. With the all you can eat pricing, they weren't too generous on their service. You get more rice than fish. After trying a few rolls I just couldn't eat anymore because of the sweet sauce they put in almost all the sushi rolls. It was way too sweet for my taste. I got a bad vibe from the wait staff when I wanted to order more food, just got a funny look from him.  Kinda made me feel guilty for order more food. Trying this place once is enough for me.",1
6374,"My delivery order was placed over the phone, but I got their menu via Allmenus.com. I called at 3:12pm, and was immediately asked if I could hold. I agreed, and then they set the phone down on the counter, and I could hear everything! Three minutes later (not too long), he came back and I ordered our pizza, along with cheese sticks. I was given my total, and told it would be there in 45 minutes because I got stuffed pizza, and it takes a bit longer to cook.

One hour and 15 minutes later, my fiance' asks me again how long they said it would take, and that is generally my cue to call them back and see what's up. I call back, am immediately again asked to hold, I said ""well, it's just about the order I just placed, I'm wondering where it is"". Their response was ""Let me get a manager"". Five minutes later the manager gets on the phone, and I let him know that they're 30 mins late. He apologizes, doesn't offer to comp anything, and tells me he should be there any minute.

10 minutes later, a knock at the door. The driver asks me if I have a pen (that doesn't happen very often - very disorganized), I sign, and let him go.

I open up the cheese sticks, and it's a hoagie roll, split in half, with cheese and herbs on it. It wasn't cut up at all, and SO not worth the $7 paid for it.

The pizza was a buffalo chicken pizza. I enjoy buffalo wings A LOT, and we generally enjoy buffalo chicken pizzas as well. The buffalo sauce on this was SO spicy that my fiance' couldn't handle it. Honestly, if you go to a place like Buffalo Wild Wings, I'd rank the sauce near their spiciest. If you're going to use a sauce that spicy on a pizza, there should be a warning, or do something to cool it off by adding ranch dressing to the pizza as well (Glass Nickel does this, and it's wonderful).

In fact, we promptly ordered 1 pizza from Glass Nickel, and the pizza was here and hot in under 20 mins.",1

Not only is she a talented colorist, she has also brought my unhealthy hair back to life. I have very thin hair and she has offered me some solutions to make it look thicker. To my fellow thin-haired peeps, call her ASAP!",5
6378,Really good food. But even more impressive was Stephanie's service! Visited ATL Saturday with a group of four and Stephanie was incredible. What was more impressive was that although it was 10 minutes before closing Stephanie still had great energy and her staff were on it. They gave us great recommendations and food came out fast. Next time I'm in Phoenix I will def visit ATL again.,5

6381,"I love their King Sandwich, which is juicy pulled pork with cole slaw on top.  It has the sweet, yummy flavor of pork and sauce with the sour crunch of the slaw.  Pure heaven.",5
6382,"I experienced this restaurant as a miss.  The best thing I had, and it was VERY good, was the made to order at your table guacamole, fresh and tasty.  Sadly that was the only thing that I thought was tasty.  The margarita special tasted like the powdered mix and not much else.  The enchiladas I had also had awful powdered tastes like everything was from a package.  I won't be going back there, too many other better Mexican restaurants around.",1
6384,"TERRIBLE.  Don't waste your time.  My husband called these guys to fix our dishwasher 3 days before a big dinner party.  We both rushed home from work to meet the scheduled technician at 5:30; the tech never showed up!  My husband called the company, and someone who called himself a ""scheduling guy"" answered a cell phone, super abrupt- said he was too busy in the line at the bank to help coordinate the details and pretty much hung up on my husband.  My husband thought they were disconnected, called the guy back, only to hear the guy call him ""rude"" for interrupting his time at the bank, my husband apologized, and they guy said it was too late and he was cancelling our appointment.  Seriously?  Your company no-shows at a job, insults customers, and then cancels our appointment??  Wow.",1
6388,"I've been to eat here twice now for lunch and every time I'm shocked that it's not more crowded.  There is a $10 lunch special featuring 6 or 7 different dishes that come with a spring roll and a drink.  I ordered the drunken noodles this time, which came out fast and looked great.  They tasted as good as they looked, especially with the house cilantro lime hot sauce which added some delightful acidity. Both my coworkers were equally pleased with their Pad Thai and namprik.  There was so much food on the plate it was easily enough for two meals.  We took boxes of leftovers home with us.  For what we paid, it feels like one of the best lunch specials in town.

The wait staff is very attentive and helpful and our server even gave us drinks in to go cups at her suggestion.  It's in a bit of an out of the way corridor of NoDa near the construction, but very much worth the trip for the price and value.  There is parking in a lot out front which is very convenient.  I would definitely make this a destination for lunch, and dinner as well!",5
6389,"We had an amazing evening at Big Rock Brewery.  We had a group of about 20, and they we toured through the facilities in two groups.  So interesting and entertaining, great tidbits of info all the way through.  Did some shopping in the gift store after.  Some wonderful gift ideas and did a bit of Christmas shopping!  The cost of the tour includes a Big Rock beer glass too!  Great idea for groups of any size.  They are very accommodating.",5
6393,"We had 2.5 hours till our flight and decided to eat here for breakfast. We were seated quickly. About ten minutes later we got our coffee and ordered our breakfast. It was taking a while, but we weren't super rushed so it seemed fine. 40 minutes later we still had not received our breakfast and noticed people who had come in after us were eating. We asked our server to check on it for us, but she brushed us off saying, ""The food takes about 20 minutes."" We had already been waiting 40 and seen everyone else around us served the food, so we were pissed that she dismissed us. Finally she came up and said she would check on it for us. Then the manager came up and said the kitchen lost our ticket. We would have been ok with that had it been dealt with earlier, but the fact that no one would even check was irritating. Then the food comes out. One of the orders was incorrect, but we ate it because at this point we'd been waiting an hour. Check came quickly. No discount for the inconvenience. I was surprised at that. We both wished we had seen the Starbucks earlier and gotten a breakfast sandwich there. I know it's an airport, but I don't really think that should be an excuse for such poor service and poor accountability for that poor service. I would NOT recommend this place.",1
6395,The best corned beef around! Big sandwich and full of flavor. It is soo good. Luv this place,5
6396,"I've been eating at Sonio's Cafe since they opened. Over the years I've tried many items on their menu. Every single thing that I've ever eaten has been FANTASTIC!!! One of my favorite items is the chicken Caesars Salad. It's amazing. Also, Lilly is FANTASTIC. She always greets you with a beautiful smile and an even more beautiful attitude. In fact everyone that I've ever come in contact with is great. Gio, one of the owners, actually called me about an hour and a half after I placed a delivery order to make sure that I was satisfied. Of course I was very satisfied. I highly recommend Sonio's Cafe.",5
6398,"This tour is a must, you get behind the scene information you wouldn't normally get on a city tour.   Ben, our tour guide, was great.  He gave us instructions on how to operate the Segway and then we practiced awhile before taking off on the tour. We were given two bottles of  water, one cold and one frozen for the trip.  Ben made sure we were safe the entire time.  We took short breaks while he explained certain places of interest and he gave us ample time to explore the Gold and Silver Pawn Shop and Rick's Restorations shop...both were great. At the end of the tour Ben dropped us off at our hotel.  You won't be disappointed with this tour.",5

Check out is 11am so if you are only there for the night it's tough to take advantage is the amenities.  :( checkout was annoying but we figured it out.   Not a horrible experience.   Wouldn't recommend it but also wouldn't bad mouth it.,5

6405,"This is my first review since I created my account few years ago.I know Manna is generally from California. I am a Korean and a big fan of Korean bbq. I have been to Gangnam and Gen several times. Service and the meats are way better than those two places. I didn't try the meats that are marinated (Gen's arinated meats might be better than here). Since this place is not advertised yet, there is no waiting list. I believe this place will be crowded once it is well known to the other big fan of Korean bbq like me.",5
6406,Very clean place. Friendly owners that seem to know everyone by first name and their order. Food is excellent! We only regret not trying this place before today. This is not a fast food establishment and seating is limited however take out is an option and well worth it! I would highly recommend this place especially the green chili burrito and must try the rice and beans! Hands down the best we have tasted in Az.!,5
6407,"Got a coupon in the mail for Delia's Cleaners and who doesn't love a coupon.  It had 30% off on cleaning with the exception of certain items which did not pertain to my items.  I entered and asked how much a blouse would be.  The young lady said $5.25 and up.  I had two blouses and one pair of pants.  She looked at one blouse and said, ""Oh, this is a premium blouse so this will be $7.10.""  I then showed her my coupon.  I expected 30% off the quoted price wouldn't you??  She goes to the register with my coupon, punches in some numbers and says, ""Oh, the premium blouse is $10.25, but with the coupon it's $7.10"".  I smelled scam all over the place.  I said to her, ""So before I showed you the coupon, it was $7.10.  After the coupon it was $7.10.  Does that sound right to you?""  With that I took my stuff and went back to my old dry cleaners which is further away but at least are honest about quoting prices.  They don't do coupons but I would rather deal with honest people than people who send out coupons with no intentions of giving you a real price break.  This is a convenient location since I shop at Fry's and Big Lots which is in the same shopping center.  If Delia's had given me a real discount and had done a good job with the cleaning, they would have gotten 100% of all my cleaning including quilts and bedspread which I usually dry clean before it gets colder.  
I just don't like the bait and switch or the maneuvering of pricing to make the public believe they are giving you a deal.  Everybody loves a deal but nobody likes a scam.",1
6408,"Love this place!! Not sure why sum picky people gave bad reviews but the burgers were amazing! I had a vegifi (best vegi burger I've ever had btw) and every1 else in our group had breakfast burgers (they loved them) and we all shared a basket of fries. The fries are the bomb!!

They gave me a window for when they would be here, when he arrived he was very nice and looked at both my fridges. One I had fixed on my own just by cleaning out the bottom, coils. He showed me what was wrong with my other fridge but unfortunately it was an expensive repair that was not worth it for us on an older fridge. But again the repair man that came to our house was very knowledgeable and friendly I would recommend them to all my friends and family.",5

Dillards is by far my favorite store here but we frequent many of them.  They used to have an awesome frequent shoppers program but stopped that unfortunately.  They do have a great SchoolCents program where your dollars can help a local school earn rewards.   Lots to love about Chandler Mall!,5
6419,If you want good food and lots of it this is the place to go! Always have a great time here usually with a large group and they rock it. Food is always yummy and service is always great.

6423,"I've been meaning to go here for over a year now, and finally last week I made it in, and am so glad I did!

The restaurant itself has a nice cozy warm atmosphere. The menu is what id describe as bistro style with plenty of French influence. One of the nicest things though is they offer BYOW (bring your own wine) for just $10 corkage (only $1 on Tuesday I believe). I ordered the Mussels Proven√ßal ($11) to start which had some great flavour. They also brought us some bread which came with house churned butter that had been accented with honey... DELICIOUS! My wife had the Baked Eggplant ($11) which she enjoyed also.

For the mains she ordered the duck confit ($26) and I opted for the bone-in veal chop ($28). She let me try some of hers also which was fantastic, especially the bread pudding, but I think the veal was my favourite by a slight edge. The Parmesan risotto cake and brandy cream peppercorn sauce... WOW!

Service was also impeccable. Not once were our glasses empty with constant attention to the wine and water.

I will definitely be returning and highly recommend making a visit. One of the gems in South Etobicoke.",5
6424,"What a beautiful shop! Located right on State St, this shop is a great place to eat some chocolate or buy some fudge. Everything is made in house and it's to die for. I'm not a fudge fan, but the fudge here is melt in your mouth delicious. Did you know fudge could do that?! I didn't! I highly recommend their turtle fudge - it's chocolate, pecans and caramel all wrapped up in one. If you're looking for something different, try the peanut butter fudge. You can't go wrong!",5
6427,"PEOPLE BEWARE!!!! I am very disappointed after this place was recommended by Discount Tire Place!!! All I needed was an alignment, brought my car in just for that, and I get a call later stating my car can NOT be aligned because the bush arms and axils are broken, my brakes need to be replaced and my transmission fluid is bad....$1100 worth of repair.... R U KIDDING ME???????

I told them that I have a regular mechanic that I have used for over 15 years, this is my best friends husband, he owns his own shop, and he will check it out for me he does everything else EXCEPT an alignment because he doesn't have a special machine for that.....

So I take my car to my friend, he checks it out & says, the only thing that needs to be replaced are the breaks.... everything else looks good. NO BUSH ARMS or AXILS are broken!!!.... I was so shocked, this Greulich's Automotive tried to RIP ME OFF, and that's sad that it probably does to sooooo many other women.

I will NEVER give you my business, and I will take this to BBB, I will tell the whole Discount Tire place NOT to recommend anyone to you, and I will tell everyone NOT to come here as well.

Very disappointing and aggravating, especially knowing the fact that women not know much about cars, YOU take advantage of innocent people!!!! If I could give you zero stars I would!!!!",1

Even though this is a pre-season game the atmosphere makes it feel like a playoff game. I would say over 90% of people there are kings fans.
walking down the strip you will meet a whole bunch of kings fan. Kings fans take over vegas for the weekend. 
I recommend staying at MGM, they normally have deals for kings fans. I also recommend going to the lazy river during the day! so much fun its basically all kings fans partying before the game!
make sure you are at the game early in the hall ways of mgm near the arena so you dont miss the gauntlet. 
GO KINGS GO!",5
6435,"I have no clue how anyone could give this place 1 star.  There's nothing like it in Charlotte.  All kinds of crap you don't need, everywhere!  This is my go to spot to buy gifts for my more eclectic friends.

Its just rows and rows of small little cubby holes full of stuff.  Some totally look like they were just taken right out of someone's tacky grandma's house.  Others may have items from all around the world.  You just have to look.

This most recent visit was for Christmas presents.  I def found what I was looking for, even though I didn't know what I was look for, lol.  That said, the music was weird and awful.  Christmas music, but at high speeds.  I guess it kept me moving though.

I'll be back, again and again.",5

I don't want to give away any of the tricks he did in the show, but he was only one feet in front of me, then he made a guy fly and disappear right next to my face. I don't know how he did that and I don't want to know why, I prefer to believe in his magic.

There is a lot of talking in the show, and David entertained people with his comedic skills. Even though it was not a big show, certainly not big at all for a huge star like David Copperfield, but his performance was still over the top, that's how he made me his fan from now on, and I can't wait to see him again someday in the future!",5
6443,"Walk thru kitchen is cool,Very different there is seating in the kitchen unique. Small plate easily feeds two people, lasagna was delicious best I've had so far!! Garlic bread is fresh and tasteful not over powering.  Cannoli's great better than chompies. Not heavily loaded with chocolate chips which I liked, but 3 for $10 feel a bit pricey. Great meal,great service. Definitely  will be back!! Come hungry or with friends/family",5

Super friendly and informative! I started with a glass of montepulciano. Delish. My bf had a very good ""Tommy"". Apparently that is a double shot tequila fresh lime juice, grapefruit bitters and a bit of agave nectar. The bartender gave us a bit of their homemade bread which was described as ""the best bread I've ever had"" by my boyfriend. We started with a small order of warm olives. I've never had warm olives but I love olives so I'm sure I'll love them warm. And I did!!! Then I had a pasta with sausages squash and radicchio. It was so good, flavourful and fresh. It was my boyfriends birthday so we splurged and had cannolis! And again........ Delicious! I can't wait to go back. We are going to be regulars!!!",5

Glenn showed up promptly and I showed him the mud tubes, then he walked the around the outside of the house and then the garage.

He explained that since it was only in one area, it can just be spot treated and quoted me what I thought was a great price and I agreed to do it that morning. I didn't bother with getting calling the other 2 companies

I felt the Glenn was very professional, knowledgeable and passionate about the business. He provided an affordable solution while educating me about termites.

6452,"Four of us had reservations for the ""Grand ReOpening"" thursday 23 May 2013 and were turned down at the door before getting inside. 
Samy came to the door as we walked up, he was very nice but seemed frazzled, and we said we had reservations from a couple days ago. He mentioned that they had fired their PR company and were no longer accepting any of the reservations. We never got an email back or a call about that cancellation. 
Nobody was inside seated but roughly 4-5 employees were standing about. 
We looked inside after the 'no reservations' comment... and asked if we could still be seated and order?  Samy promptly replied ""No sorry we are closed"".  We walked away.

Now... we walked up excited to check it out and were going in with good intentions... everybody deserves a first-hand look and review of their own. But they're continuously turning down paying customers... I've seen the show. I've seen the mess on their FB and social media. I was around when the original Yelp stuff went down with Joel and then on ChowBella...  It's a story for sure. Just wish I was able to try it out for myself. 

Not sure where they'll be in 6mo...",1

6455,"Ordered for pick up and I have to say it was quite pretty darn good. Got the kilobyte burger, byte size spicy poutine, and chicken souvlaki for the cost of around $20.  Pretty cheap considering the size of each dish. The burger and souvlaki comes with an abundant amount of toppings and the byte size poutine is huge!  In regards to their poutine I got the spicy special that included bell peppers and 2 onion rings on top of an over flowing amount of fries and honestly even though I love spice, I would recommend the regular poutine.  The bell pepper marinade takes away from the taste of the gravy and cheese which I consider the whole point of getting a poutine! It was still very delicious as was everything else but I think it would be even better without the spice addition.  For the burger though, the bell peppers added a nice kick to an already delicious package. As I have stated many times already, portions were large, I could barely finish the burger and poutine. So far my favourite burger joint to date.",5
6457,The Nerd is a pretty fantastic environment for those who enjoy a gaming experience with their drinks.

6458,"I'm just in shock by my experience here.. I had been in contact with Stephanie who was very sweet and she got me to go in and check out the car we picked out. I went in on Wednesday and I spoke with mike, super nice guy I really liked him! I was interested in a 2015 Camaro LT. We test drove it and crunched some numbers. I was approved with no money down or anything but it was just a little out of my price range so I went home to think about it. I came back today on Halloween and told Mike that I'm ready to look for more cost affective options but still desired a Camaro. He handed me off to Chris who tried selling me a 2013 for almost $200 more. It was such a rip off. And than he told me he could bring that car down to what the 2015 would be but if I could afford that to begin with why would I get the older model? Well that was absolutely insulting and instead of him trying to find me a car in my price range, knowing what car I wanted and where I wanted to be, he was concerned more with the commission he'd be losing and made me seem crazy for the price I wanted to be at. I work in customer service and that is not how you help your customers. You find the best solution for them. I will not be coming back here and I will probably buy a mustang instead!

40$ per bag
Most uncomfortable seating ever
No drinks, no snacks (even water) without an up charge 
Incredibly rude stewardesses!  Beyond belief!

First - each person that got up to use the bathroom was told to go back and sit in their seats ""I cannot permit you to do that right now"" is what one stewardess told a young teenager who when asked ""what are you doing"" and he replied ""I have to go to the bathroom""  

Second - a gentleman came rushing into the back of the plane when the same stewardess says "" what do you think you're doing, the fasten seatbelt sign is still on, go sit down!!"" The man tried to explain that his son had just gotten sick and thrown up and all he wanted to do was clean him up and buy a ginger ale to settle his stomach.  The woman again told the man to return to his seat - that the crew would take care of it when they could!  I mean come on - the mans kids just threw up in the cabin!

I always get take out pho here, ordering on the phone ahead of time, usually takes them 10-15 minutes.  I never had to wait a long time for my order.  The people that work here know what they're doing!  Whenever I do eat inside, whenever I want more broth they always give me more with no problem or charge.  I love it.  Sometimes at other pho restaurants the broth is kind of oily which makes my stomach churb, but Pho Annie's pho isn't like that, it is always on point! I would go to this pho restaurant before going all the way to Chinatown for pho.  It's just as good, probably even better than most pho places on Spring Mountain.",5

Lovely to look at outside the red footbridge that leads inside, I also found this restaurant to serve colorful and very tasty Cantonese food in a relaxed setting.  Diane and I were seated on a comfortable banquette and a Chinese-themed chair behind a black lacquered table.

This was our best bargain of RW, because for $30.13 the first course for each person included an Asian Tapas Sampler that consisted of a Steamed Shrimp Dumpling with Chili Aioli, Pan Fried Pork Potsticker, and a Spicy Wonton; the second course a choice of Wok Seared Salmon with Ginger Basil Sauce, Grilled BBQ Korean Short Ribs, or Honey Walnut Shrimp with Lemon Aioli; and the third course a Dessert Trio of Chocolate Ganache, Lemongrass Gelee with Coconut Tapioca, and Lychee Mochi Ice Cream.  None of the appetizers or desserts could be ordered in such combinations off the regular menu except to pay for each item separately.

The potsticker was excellent with Ginger Sauce.  I didn't find the wonton to be spicy at all.  And, I quickly gobbled up the delicious steamed dumpling.  Since I was very hungry and wanted to thoroughly check this place out, plus present a more comprehensive review, I also ordered a bowl of Spicy Chicken Hot & Sour Soup, which was nicely hot and spicy as billed, with morsels of chicken, bamboo shoots, Wood Ear Mushrooms, Green Onions, and Black and Glass Noodles--a fairly mild but still spicy, good-sized serving for one diner.

Lucky for me, Diane had a Hard Rock Hotel BOGO coupon for Fu from the night before when we had become introduced to Culinary Dropout, so besides two entrees of Honey Walnut Shrimp, we were also presented with our ordered choice of Kung Pao Chicken.  Diane got her Walnut Shrimp devegetablized but I enjoyed the cool cucumber slices that served to offset the warm and large battered shrimps.  The Lemon Aioli on this dish was subtle, the shrimps were succulent, and the candied walnuts were neatly covered with sesame seeds.  This entree was quite large in size.

Indeed, there is no noticeable portion control in operation here.  The Kung Pao Chicken that was plunked before me on a platter was easily enough to serve two (even though I ate two entrees by myself).  But I'm a big boy with a big appetite!  LOL!  This was dead-ahead Cantonese Kung Pao Chicken just mildly spicy with slices of Red and Green Bell Pepper, mostly whole peanuts, and no visible Chili Peppers.  The spice emanated from the Brown Sauce in which the large tender hunks of chicken and other ingredients were bathed.  No filler like celery was present, and no fat clung to the top-tier chicken.

In the assemblage of desserts, the tapioca tasted lemony, and the mochi resembled the flavor of vanilla.  The Chocolate Ganache with chocolate rabbit ears on top, and cake underneath, was fabulous.  Even the smooth and hot Jasmine Mist Organic Tea was great!  And, refilled ceramic pots just kept on coming for the extensive duration of our dinner.  The meal lasted long because I was barely able to finish all of the fine Cantonese food laid out before me.  But eventually I did!

Thumping music added to the otherwise serene ambiance.  And, service was friendly and excellent, and so accommodating that when I asked for Sweet & Low, although I found out that it is not normally served in the restaurant (Splenda and Equal are), a server on his own initiative left the restaurant to get some from Room Service, and quickly returned with a large supply of pink packets.

This was a great way for us to bid goodbye to Restaurant Week just before we left for California.  And, we will surely be back for more of the wonderful Cantonese food so graciously served at Fu.",5
6469,Had a delicious duck confit on Swiss chard. Mine was the first order of the night it took a little longer so they gave us free dumplings while we waited. A+ food and service.,5
6470,This place is not a good dental place. They have a very poor costomer service. Do not go. This is not a good place to take your kids at all.  I wasted half of my afternoon waiting for these dentists to take my kids in. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.,1
6471,"so glad I walked in!

I had time to kill in Old Montreal and as I walked past a beautiful sub-level hair salon, I decided top stop in to check for availability and prices for a blowout. It was such a beautiful salon I expected it to be booked and out of my price range, but they were able to squeeze me in at the end of the day last minute for a great price. The salon despite being downstairs is open and airy. I had a great scrub and scalp massage and then a wonderful blowout by Francesca, who even gave me some great recommendations for bars & restaurants. They use Aveda products which is an added plus! Would recommend this salon to anyone!",5
6472,"great place, great bartenders, good sound system..they COULD have a lil' better AC system for those sweltering summer nites but i digress..:)...COUNTRY TUESDAY w/COREY rocks!!...or countries!!!!",5
6473,"Omg, amazing dim sum. Where do I begin. Friendly staff, very cute dinging area, delicious food. Handmade, amazing dim sum. The Shanghai soup dim sum was our favorite. When me and my husband are in this part of the valley again we will be here in a heart beat!",5
6475,"My favorite facial in Las Vegas. I went there since 2011 and always happy with the service. $65 for 75mins, includes facial and hand massage. The store is small but clean and Amy really understands my biggest concerns so whenever I go there, I am completely satisfied. I went there last week and I can see POSITIVE of my skin. Great service, I love it.",5
6477,"We loved this place.   Great service and the food was good.  Loved that we can get sushi, American and chinese!!",5
6478,"Stopped by for a quick lunch. Wasn't expecting the food that I had. You know, the meal where you say, I could come back here for dinner. Priced very well and the portions are great too! Must say, if you are looking for options with a nice brew, hit this one up; you will be happy you did!",5
6480,"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.

In the interest of full disclosure and fairness -  I do fancy their biltong.  That said, a good product does not a good business make.  The owners/workers at this place are complete jerks!  Walked in a couple of weeks ago and was not greeted by either of the two persons working in a bedroom sized shop.  When I asked about purchasing biltong in bulk the woman muttered something about internet pricing being different and when I asked a question attempting to clarify she blurted out, ""It's just too difficult to explain"".  And kept repeating, ""$22.99 a pound, it's $22.99 a pound"".

It makes perfect sense because their website is a complete piece of crap that is nearly impossible to navigate. 

As for the cultural insensitivity one reviewer mentioned...One needn't consider culture when there exists a lack of basic human decency.  I have been in and out of Southern Africa for 3 decades and NEVER been treated as poorly as I was in by South Africans as I was in Matthews, North Carolina.  Their laughable website alludes to the Boers and Voortrekkers-they should be in shame for invoking those names as they are an embarrassment to a people with a proud tradition of hospitality.

Kinda weird how Yelp doesn't openly display the very critical reviews of this kak plek (shit place).  We'll see if they put this one in ""reviews not currently recommended"".",1
6482,"Best vets office I have ever been to. The staff are so helpful and caring. The hospital is super clean, comfortable, and private.  My little cat (well little pudgy), Eugene, had the unfortunate need for their services a few months back. While on vacation and shortly after being checked on by some friends, Eugene decided to jump behind our washing machine, where he remained for two days. Horrible right? I still get sick even thinking the little guy was trapped for that long. I assumed since he had food and water that he would be fine. Boy was I wrong. Learn from me and do not ever have your animals unchecked on for more than a day. Anyways, we return and I find him and he is in horrible shape.  After taking him to an ER in Avondale twice and was so disappointed in their care (not to mention costs), I found this amazing place. They nurtured my little Eugene back to health, kept close tabs on his condition, and kept him medicated well while he heeled. The staff were just great and the prices were more than fair. I have tons of faith in this great hospital and would refer them to anyone. Just hope you never have to deal with what Eugene and my family had to.",5
6484,"Woooow! It's like I was in a real Sicilian kitchen. Don't get fooled by the strip mall setting and the simple decor, the food is delicious! Best Italian o have ever had. The ingredients are so much better too-- it's not all the grease like at some places. It's just deeelicious. Family owned as well which is always a plus.",5
6485,"Horrible horrible experience. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. My girlfriend and I were stopped on the strip by a guy named luke, i believe. He was really nice and smooth with his words but dont believe anything they tell you. They will tell you that you'll receive free drinks and food. Absolutely no food was provided, resulting in me feeling sick because I started slowly drinking on an empty stomach, thinking I would be able to eat a meal with my drink. First bar we went to, we received one drink ticket. The bartenders told us we could either get a beer or a well drink so we got 2 pineapple vodkas. We were a little over half way done with our drinks, and the bartender says they made a mistake and the ticket was only for a beer, so we had to pay for our well drinks. Horrible miscommunication between the bar staff and the world crawl staff. We headed to the next bar, and there were lots of sugar filled shots laid out for us all, which was the only decent thing they provided, except half way through people grabbing shots, they announce that it's only 1 shot per person and anyone seen grabbing more than 1 would be kicked out. They're so cheap, they scam thousands of people everyday, the least they can do is provide more than 1 shot per person. Once we moved on to the next spot, which was drai's, everyone split up and did they're own thing.
Overall, this was a waste of time and money. You're better off talking to promoters throughout the strip and getting on guestlists.",1
6486,"The food is amazing, and freshly made. If that wasn't enough he customer service is, hands down, the best in Phoenix! I love going there. The portion sizes are HUGE and it has the best atmosphere. The sushi is fantastic.. I highly recommend the Arizona Roll.",5
6487,"What a wonderful find! 

This restaurant has a lot of character and personal laity.  Both times I went was during lunch and it wasn't that busy but bustling enough to create a wonderful ambience. 

I love the customized approach to fish and chips that Off The Hook takes. I ordered the Rainbow trout with Cajun batter and Cajun fries and Jalape√±o ranch dipping sauce and Vinegritte coleslaw.

When it finally arrived, it smelt like perfection and it was a concoction of perfectly blended spices, well cooked fish with a gorgeous crust that was just ridiculously delicious with a lovely crispy texture. The fries were mouth wateringly decadent and spicy as well. The dip was the cherry on top as it just accentuated the whole dish to a level of culinary grandeur and the coleslaw worked well to balance the spices with its sweet and mild flavors. 

The only problem was the quantity as it was an ordeal to finish the massive portions served. 

All in all it made for a wonderful dining experience.",5
6488,"Ordered take out tonight, arrived quickly, piping hot, and delicious. 5 stars... great stuff!",5
6489,"Every experience has been, at least, great! The lobby can get loud for a moment or two during the hour combo massage (I !!) but that is mostly due to guests arriving and speaking at a regular volume, not realizing people are right there behind a curtain. You can undress or not. I have been going to this little place for over 5 years and I can't say enough about the quality of service the staff provides. Every massage is so relaxing and they adjust pressure to your comfort level. I had surgery two weeks ago and have been twice, since, only to have Amy and Linda work wonders! Thank you guys",5
6490,Amazing experience! First time Ever that we didn't have to muzzle our angry little boy!! The wonderful lady actually was able to pick Jack up and cuddle him while the other lady trimmed his nails. And the cost was So reasonable! We're in Love with Cute Cuts for Mutts!! Thanks guys!!,5

6493,I definitely agree with other positive reviews!!  They are courteous and I don't need to worry about high price that I have no idea what the charges are for.  They have fixed my tire within reasonable time frame and free of charge!!,5
6494,"Great food, but Kristina could take a hike.   We are paying customers and we're treated like trash.   I won't let her bring down the whole place though... if you don't like where you are, leave.   All my best, Will Belsterling.",5

Tim was very professional.
He took the time to explain what he was going to do and what to expect.

6496,"Ho, je ne mets pas 5 √©toiles parce-que √ßa m'a co√ªt√© cher. En fait pour tout dire c'√©tait mon cadeau d'anniversaire, j'ai eu une petite goutte de sueur au moment de l'addition pour mon ami, mais cri$#* qu'on a pass√© un moment d'anthologie qui valait tout l'or du monde.
Parlons bouffe dabord. 7 services ""surprise"" c'est-√†-dire selon la saison et l'arrivage, ce qui fait souvent un grand restaurant: fra√Æcheur et qualit√© des ingr√©dients. Les portions sont parfaites, certainement calcul√©es par un mathematicien pour que l'espace de n'importe quel estomac soit rempli sans pour autant d√©border.  Plus ou moins dans l'ordre, p√©toncle, oursin, foie gras po√™l√©, boeuf et agneau, tous appr√™t√©s ou cuits √† la perfection. (j'en ai oubli√© un oups). Les accompagnements sont aussi tr√®s originaux avec des ingr√©dients simples tel que panais, courges...je pense notamment au foie gras accompagn√© de gaufres liegeoises, pistaches roties, courge confite et poire poch√©e. BOUM. Le dessert √©tait tr√®s surprenant, compos√© d'une multitude d'√©l√©ments soigneusement mont√©s, je retiendrai surtout la partie meringue de sapin. BADABOUM. 
Je manque de mots et d'onomatop√©es pour d√©crire les vins. Le premier vin, blanc, provenait de Galice, une r√©gion vinicole que j'aime beaucoup. En blague j'ai averti le sommelier que √ßa allait √™tre difficile de faire mieux et d'aller en crescendo sur la longueur du repas. HO MON DIEU. Je ne sais pas si c'√©tait un d√©fi personnel bien que le sommelier soit quand m√™me tr√®s comp√©tent,  mais OUI. Les vins non seulement √©taient meilleurs de service en service, mais ils ont su d√©fier mon palais par leurs saveurs inattendues. Je devrais dire in√©dites. Je pense que je ne boirai jamais d'aussi bons vins √† moins d'en faire une qu√™te d'une vie. 
C√¥t√© service rien √† redire bien s√ªr. Nous avons jou√© la carte de la provocation toute la soir√©e pour d√©tendre un peu l'atmosph√®re un peu pinc√©e et attendue d'une grande table. D√©j√† je suis entr√©e l√† habill√©e √† l'arrache car...c'√©tait une surprise je ne savais vraiment pas o√π on allait. Tout le staff a √©t√© d√©licieux et ri avec nous tout le long √† nos jokes plates et nos exclamations d'extase. Avec du recul j'ai l'impression d'avoir √©t√© G√©rard Depardieu. Enfin nous avons fait un petit tour en cuisine pour voir o√π la magie se passe. En revenant √† nos si√®ges on ne pouvait plus bouger. Et puis on voulait plus partir.",5
6497,"Owner of company is completely unprofessional and rude, more-so than any other business owner I have ever dealt with.  I understand it may have been an icy, cold day but that is no reason for your manners to fold under the pressure when people need your services, especially when it is a money-making day for you.  I urge anyone who reads this review to take your business elsewhere as this man does not deserve the revenue he gets when he treats myself and other customers in this manner.  Complete asshole.",1
6498,"Not that great or anything special.  The price is ok for what you get. I'm not sure if I'd bother coming back.


The restaurant charged us for a bad cup of coffee that they served that we asked to have replaced. That is very unreasonable, we won't be back ever.",1
6499,"After a traumatizing salon experience, I knew I needed to find a new salon & stylist that really knows hair & how to give it some much needed TLC. My research led me to David Ross Salon & I was fortunate enough to get Amanda as my stylist. Good listener, sweet disposition, artfully skilled in cutting and color, she knew exactly what my hair needed. She made my appointment reassuring & enjoyable and with my end result, remarkable. So glad to have found her and David Ross Salon!",5

Carly was also wonderful. She was really nice and distracting, and used almost exclusively hard wax (perhaps because I told her I can't stand the pain), which I really appreciated.",5

I had to have my first fillings which was a drag but Dr Featherstone and staff were just great. Totally painless and as smooth as it goes.

6511,"I had George bend me up a couple pipes for my custom exhaust, and when I ran into a snag and took the vehicle to him about getting another pipe fabricated he was a complete jerk. I don't own a hydraulic bender or a lift, that's the only reason I was there. What I was asking for would have taken less then an hour to do with those tools. He spoke down to me the entire time constantly telling me that my vehicle was ""a mess"" and that I was doing ""everything wrong"" and that he refused to work on my vehicle unless he got to completely tear everything out and redo it, which I couldn't afford. I'm a machinist and welder that has grown up around cars and apprenticed in numerous hot rod shops. I might know a thing or two, and the first thing I know is I would NEVER treat my customers that way. I would avoid this place at all costs.",1

6524,"I was surprised to see that other Yelpers thought this place was cheap.  Five dollars ($5.00) for a bean burrito is not reasonable, in my opinion.  To be fair, the burrito was pretty large, but I did not like that there was one price regardless of the ingredients.

The real reason that I am even writing a review is because of the poor service.  As soon as I walked in, this large and gruff man said, ""Whaddya want?""  And after I ordered, there was of course no ""Thank You,"" no eye contact, no smile.

Poor service is my pet peeve, no matter where it is found.  It just irks me.",1
6525,"I will always give a place a second chance. This place will not get a 3rd from me. The second time was a terrible waste of money. First time the ribs were just flavorless blah ribs. The second time I wanted prime rib but they were out. I ordered a fillet and wanted it pink, not bloody. I dont know what the heck I got but it was some thin peice of overcooked yuck!. I even told the server Id rather have it under cooked because I could get an extra flash if needed. Cant undo overcooked. I wasnt going to wait for another while the rest of my party had their dinner. The other issues with that visit was very slow service even though there were literally only 4 other tables. The appetizer was very tasty but artificially fluffed with a whole bunch of lettuce for visual deception. Drinks were overpriced but thats the norm anymore or anywhere you go. But the absolute last thing with this visit was the ladies room was not stocked with ANY paper product!!!!!! My fault for not checking. Thank goodness we were on the way out. And as I was complaining about it to my daughter, one of the employees heard me and laughed! She was giggling about it! SERIOUSLY? NEVER AGAIN!

6535,"I needed to get Canadian passport pictures taken for my renewal application and was informed via yelp talk (thanks, Tiger W!) to go to this little photo shack across from UNLV.  The owner/photographer is super nice and knew exactly what I needed when I said I wanted a Canadian passport pic.  He reassured me that he has done them before, is a ""recommended"" passport photographer (by the Canadian consulate in LA), and has all the current specifications on hand.  He was quick, thorough, and professional in his work and after about one hour (hung out in Einsteins Bagels while the pictures developed), he handed me the final product.  Perfect.  (Canadian) passport pictures are $25 for 2.

Much of their business is photo developing and restoration from old photos and from *gasp* film!  If I had any old photos to save, I'd come here.  As it is, I am very happy with the quality of my pictures and am less hesitant than normal to show them to the appropriate customs authorities because the pics make me look less like a fugitive and more like a person with a neutral facial expression.  :)",5
6536,The food is amazing. The service is wonderful! My dad brought me a slice and I ate it cold and it was so good I had to check it out. Ended up doing an office team builder in one of their private room. My whole team loved it! My favs were the white pizza and the veggie pizza. They also have a bar. The prices were reasonable. I've been back a few times now and it's always excellent!,5

The young people working there were very professional and nice. The theater, ladies room, and lobby were extremely clean. 

I enjoyed my visit",5
6543,"Time to focus on the positive. Scramble has turned their quality control around and I need to recognize them for doing so.

In my previous reviews I go on and on about the Toluca breakfast pizza and was dismayed as it seem to be getting less fantastic every time I stopped in. To the point of not recommending it anymore to anyone. Did it stop me from checking in? No. I'm glad I kept checking. 

At least a half dozen in a row over the last few months have been great. I'm so happy!

Special notice regarding customer service: Stacy rocks! She's is the kind of employee that keeps a business going and customers coming in. She gives a damn and works hard. I believe she might be responsible for the triumphant return of the Toluca! She always asks me how it is and is actually interested in my answer. Thanks Stacy!",5

The owner of the company was easy to work with and the Driver was friendly and accommodating. For such a busy day, they were extremely patient with our group.  They even allowed us to keep our refreshments under the bus while they ran another group to and from the Open (which kept the total price down as well).

Will definitely use them again!",5

I especially love how unassuming this place is, absolute miracles come out of their visibly meager small kitchen.  They put these showcase places with big specatcle kitchens to shame.  Dino wings are incredible, their curry chicken burger was phenomenal and their salmon sashimi, superior.  Their himachi tar tar and even their eggplant makes any carnivore a herbavore.  This place should be a staple and should be bigger because they'll start hitting some serious radars the more and more miracles come out of that 5√ó5 kitchen.",5

There's 2 people working in the joint who kept saying ""thank you for your patience"" but never sat my party down. The meat in my burger tasted like it was out of a can. Buns soggy, vegetables turning brown, ALL BAD. If you're ever in the Scottsdale area, do NOT go to this location. It will make you wish you stayed home

All I can say is that I don't have any intention of going back the owner said the hummus was made on site overall it was pretty disgusting I also had a cup of the lemon and rice chicken soup which I love that also was not so great I had trouble finding a few pieces of chicken in the soup and had more of a sour flavor than the taste of lemon. We both had shish kabobs the chicken was tough vegetables few. Frankly I don't see this restaurant lasting very long,1
6576,"As embarassed as I am to say it, I hadnt been to the dentist in an extended amount of time when I finally decided to bite the bullet (no pun intended) and find an expert. Dr. J and his entire staff at Squaw Peak Dental blew me away. From the moment I walked in the door, each knew who I was (even though it was my first time in the office) welcomed me, gave me a detailed tour, and even showed me the back office. The first impression of the office is sophistication, with the interior done very modern and clean, but super comfortable. There is flat screens in the waiting area, along with XBOX and Playstation for the kids (and/or kids at heart), a very clean restroom where you can brush one more time before hearing the cold hard facts, and then a private consultation area where you can discuss new procedures like teeth whitening, mouthguards, etc. My appointment was very thorough, from the digital photography and mapping of my beautiful chompers, to the full diagnostic cleaning and assessment. At the end of the appointment, its time for the judge to rule, and Dr. J reviews all of the previous work done by his friendly staff, and then makes personal recommendations for you to work on until your next visit. The office is conveniently located next door to the Aunt Chiladas and Pointe Squaw Peak Hilton, and is on the 3rd floor of a new office building with great mountain views. I would recommend beyond a shadow of a doubt to friends, family, relatives, enemies, and anyone I can tell, to go to Squaw Peak Dental and see Dr. J!",5
6578,Best Sushi and Sashimi ever -- Was up here for a Triathlon in Boulder City and we drove all the way to this west side location to try it since it had such good ratings. Well worth the extra trip and will be back next time I am in Vegas for anything!,5
6579,"Just to reiterate, this place is fantastic. It's small businesses like Eden's Grill that make neighborhoods. Worth the trip every time. And they cater! Amazing handmade desserts too. Spread the word!",5
6580,"Not a professional establishment. I've never had a chair break on me in a restaurant. I realize that I'm larger than a standard person at 6'3"" and 300lbs, but if you serve something titled the big rig geared towards the types you see in a Coppola film, you should anticipate some above average size people. 
Accidents happen, as a paramedic supervisor I understand that, but a seemingly annoyed manager who does absolutely zero to offer some type of resolve other than ""a bag of ice or something,"" has earned a permanent lost customer.",1
6581,"No nonsense, great food. Every visit this place has delivered. The meats are so damn flavorful and the house made bbq sauces are fantastic. The New England clam chowder is bomb as hell (love me some good chowda). And the $4 specials on rail old fashioneds (bourbon, sour, not sweet) are awesome. Love living down the street from some great BBQ!",5

The down comforters, the complimentary slippers, the LCD HD screens, and the bathroom TV  were my favorite features of my stay.

6586,"Bmv is NOT the place to go if you have a specific book in mind. It keeps cost down by not keeping a digital database and it is too huge to operate like an old school bookstore where the owner knows every single book. 

Instead it is like a well organized library with quality selection and inexpensive prices. Only complaint, it seems that  the science section has been dumbed down by all the new age science books but they still accept used books I believe. 

It is always fun to spend time in this bookstore and I spent a fortune here. I hope time would not degenerate this store.",5
6591,"I requested a quote late on a Saturday night. I received an instant text message, followed by a phone call and then an email. I set up the appointment and they arrived on time and worked hard the entire move to make sure that we did not get billed for any down time. They were super respectful and professional. They took great care in making sure that none of our items were damaged in the move and made us aware of potential issues with moving certain things. They were awesome and I would highly recommend them to anyone.",5
6593,"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner with high expectations and they did not disappoint. Whatsoever. It's honestly difficult to find something that's not exceptional on this menu. I ordered the clam spago that was on special and was absolutely mind blown, whereas he ordered the Halibut that I tried and the only word he had to describe it was ""phenomenal"". 

Awesome service, great ambience and awesome views of Camelback. 

10/10 would recommend",5

They play the oldies that you can dance to and singalong to from Vanilla Ice to Bon Jovi. They make funny noises to go along with their ""nerd"" theme and they were hilarious! The dancing was well choreographed and in sync! I wish they played longer!",5
6595,"When I wrote my first review of Discount Tire on E. Thomas Rd. I knew it was a stinging review. Also, that it was valid. As such I also sent my review to corporate headquarters. The same day I recieved a call from Ryan, the manager, of the E. Thomas Rd. store.  His apology was warm and sincere.  There were no buts or explaining away. He asked what my main concern was and I told him about the issue with the spare tire. He immediately said:""Bring it in, I'll look at your spare and, if needed, replace it free of charge."" Turns out it was a donut tire but looked like it had been used several times. It was replaced for free. That was more then I expected but am quite pleased.  
 The process was lengthy because the donut had to be ordered and because of my work schedule. Each time I went in tho I was given SUPERIOR customer service. When I went in to pick up the donut Jim helped me and even tho, by looking at my invoice, he prolly knew who I was, he was courteous and treated me like john q customer. I appreciated that.  
 I am giving Discount Tire on E. Thomas Rd. 5 stars because my issues were resolved with grace and dignity, on both sides, intact. But more because I felt like my concerns had been heard. Thank you.",5

When the burrata with brussel sprouts are in season we each get our own, way to amazing to share. The burrata with fried green tomatoes will do for now. This is my favorite spot for HH.

Had my parents drop off my vehicle in morning and pick up in afternoon. when the picked up the vehicle the charge was $27.40. They paid. When i came home and found out what the bill came to i called and talked with ""Randy"" he said the extra charge was the the vehicle took an extra quart. 
When I go to Pep Boys the coupons are for $19.95 and no more.
And on top of it all the recommended items they found for my vehicle was to change the radiator coolant, That was just done 5 months before.

I could easily browse the store for hours!!!",5
6604,The restaurant is great - BUT DON'T USE THE VALET! I parked there for 90 minutes while I had dinner using the valet service and when I left my GPS was gone.

This is too nice a restaurant to have such a poor valet service.,1

6611,"My experience at this establishment was nothing short of horrible. This was the 3rd time that I tried it and found that the  costumer care is lacking. The first time the staff was rude to my self and my friend. The second time I came in for a wax and the receptionist who is the owner told me to go to the room I waited for 10 min  when a staff finally arrived she asked me to leave the room do that she can serve a different client. I left after that. 
I then decided to try them one more time today. The wax OK though I had to tell the girl that it was to hot but she still continued with out cooling it I finally had to be persistent regarding the hot wax. 
The   pedicure was fine but not worth the money they charge.  I then processed to get a full set of powder gel nails. When I sat down I told the nail tech exactly what I wanted. Half way I noticed that my nails where different shapes and length. I had to ask her multiple times to file them, and fix them. She became rude and argumentative with me and sent me to talk to the owner  who  told me to go somewhere else.  
If you want to be treated like trash then this is the place to go. 
I then drove to zen nails on avenue road and received great service as well as they fixed my horrible looking nails",1
6612,"Look, I don't expect a whole lot out of Albertson's. I get that it is a mega chain, and in general I really don't shop there.  However, I began to buy products from Albertson's about a month ago, because I became aware that they carried local sustainable shrimp and I wanted to support the cause.  However, Alberton's has disappointed me so badly, I get the feeling I will be boycotting them for a very long time.   

I was playing around online one day and came across the website of Blue Oasis Shrimp.  Much to my surprise, Blue Oasis Shrimp is a sustainable shrimp company IN LAS VEGAS that farms environmentally friendly, hormone free, shrimp.  Even more surprising, the Alberton's across the street from my home carried this shrimp.  Being from San Francisco, I was really excited that I could actually buy fresh shrimp from the grocery.  So the next day I walk across the street to Alberton's to get my shrimp.  

First I was dismayed to learn that the shrimp apparently doesn't sell very well, and from what I could tell, really isn't promoted.  (One of the worker's behind the counter offered that many people can't get past the fact that the heads are still on the shrimp).  Disappointing, but I pledged that my boyfriend and I would be in every week to buy our pound of shrimp. Note, that while we were there, we also spent 50 bucks on other groceries. Money we wouldn't have spent at Albertson's otherwise. I wrote Alberton's customer service department, to urge them to continue selling this product and was rewarded with an impersonal, canned response that had clearly not been written by anyone who had taken the time to read my letter. 

Today, my boyfriend went in the store to buy our usual order, and noticed that the shrimp wasn't on display any longer. He asked about the shrimp and was told that because the product doesn't sell, the shrimp is now immediately frozen in 5 pound blocks, and that they would need to go defrost some.  So just to be clear, the fresh shrimp, that I am buying because it is fresh shrimp, that came from down the street, is now frozen upon arrival.  Which defeats the purpose of buying fresh shrimp.  Even more insulting, they continued to charge him the full $12.99 price per pound.  To compare, I believe the shrimp that is frozen, deheaded, and shipped from THAILAND is $9.99 a pound. But I am paying 3 dollars more for shrimp that had to be trucked in from 5 miles down the road, and then promptly ruined.  And I also wonder how Alberton's expects to sell any shrimp if it is all sitting in a freezer in the back, and not displayed in any way at the front counter?

Again, I realize that Alberton's is a chain, and that if their customers aren't buying something, they may not be particularly worried about little things like supporting local business, or environmentally sustainable food.  However, sustainable shrimp in the desert is such a cool idea, and Alberton's just doesn't appear to support, care or respect the product it is lucky enough to carry.  I do feel bad for the worker's behind the counter, who appear genuinely frustrated, and agree that this shrimp is the best shrimp they have ever tasted.  I will likely search to see if there is another store (a different Alberton's or even better, a different business) that carries this shrimp, and actually sells is fresh as is intended.",1
6613,Came back to redeem my coupons! The service is always great when I come here. They are always very helpful in explaining their menu and are very quick at making my order. Everything is made to order so your food will be hot and fresh. Their menu changing so there aren't any more meals except one (which I think is worth it). It's also nice having a Hot Dog on a Stick that isn't in a mall!,5

6623,"Horrible service. The waitresses barely spoke english, and got upset when I asked them to repeat themselves. They were very cold and short tempered with me and my family. 

When I went to pay, the man behind the desk was texting or doing something on his phone, and did not immediately attend to our service. 

The food was cold, not kept warm and food all over the buffet, and is overly greasy, there are other ingredients other than oil.",1

The X-rays were done and then my dental plan was worked out and then BOOM, I was getting a root canal the same day, mins after my X-rays. What I liked most was that Dr. Steve was really polite to all his staff, he kept saying ""please"" and ""thank you"" & even ""great job"", it made me feel comfortable.

The pizza prices are really decent tbh for the quality. Add $2 for the gluten free.

The office itself is new and very modern. The waiting area is beautiful with plenty of spacious seating and a coffee station to visit while you wait. 

The exam rooms have a huge TV in it that you can navigate yourself and learn about any OB or Gyn issue you may have or might just be curious about. Also, I love the fact that you don't have to feel any pressure when you get changed. When you are ready, all you have to do is push the green button and it lets your care provider know you are ready for them to come in.",5

I was told service would take 45 - 60 minutes. I received a phone call stating that due to my car having a crossbar under the engine, they would not be able to remove the gasket or filter, that would be another $140. on top of the $50 paid for dumping the fluid and replacing the fluid only.

Ordered a chicken panni which was just disgusting.   They actually served a concoction of minced chicken with cheese and spinach.   Absolutely vile.   

And the service equalled the food.  Just pathetic.  Hour and half for lunch midweek. The manager was as clueless as the waiter.

I cannot express in words how absolutely awful this place is.   Clueless service and disgusting food.  No one was smiling like in their commercials.  The most awful chain restaurant.  Beware.  Vile!",1
6652,"Second time going there and each time I went there I was disappointed. 

This SHOP just opened up near my home and I was happy to see something similar to V's Barbershop open up near me since I use to drive about 20 minutes to get to one. Few months later,  I decided to stroll in for a haircut, lady took me in - it wasn't busy at all - in fact it was empty , I told her I wanted a haircut and she went along cutting my hair which felt like something I can get at Fantastics Sams or SuperCuts. I didn't feel at  it was a special ""MENS"" Grooming place at all.  After my haircut, I looked at it a few times and had to correct her on uneven sides and bulk hair leftover. I mean c'mon - you want us to pay big bucks and I have to correct your hair skills? 

The second visit, I figured I'd give them another shot but I'm usually that guy that ""you only get one shot to prove me you're good"" but since I'm a nice guy - I thought maybe I'd just get a shave/trim. One lady in there, nobody else in there and I have to make an appointment?  I mean how long does it take to get a shave/trim ?? No where in their website says anything about making appointment so what gives? You really can't spare another 20-30 minutes to do a quick shave/trim? People make appointments all the time and they still wait to get seen so even if you were 10 minutes late for your appointment it wouldn't matter you just made the company money and probably an extra tip for taking me in as a walk - in? 

Does this place hire dummies or what? 

I'm not going back here again. V's Barbershop doesn't disappoint me, never has,  and they are worth far more better tips then this wannabe place.",1

6665,"So apparently, according to my friends, I ""always"" want to go to Local 510. They call it ""my bar."" Because I always suggest it.

Local 510 is just awesome. A lot of 17th Ave bars are filled with drunk 18-year-olds and there's nothing wrong with that, but when you're not a drunk 18-year-old anymore, it's kind of nice to go somewhere where there is a slightly older and calmer crowd.

The music is always fantastic, the food is tasty and the beer is pretty good. I think they could up their tap selection if they wanted to move into the next level of awesome, but I'm happy with Grasshopper when I go there.

All in all, Local 510 is great for a night with friends or lunch...or dinner. It's loud and busy, but not too loud. The service is friendly and the space is cool looking and clean (for a bar). The line up starts after 10, so even getting there half an hour earlier makes the difference between waiting in line and not waiting.

Also, hipsters. Lots of hipsters. But let's be honest, that's my crowd.",5
6668,"Durant's is an institution in Phoenix. You will regularly see politicians, celebrities, and athletes dining here. It has classic old school charm with wood paneling and a red tint inside. You can enter through the kitchen, which is a great experience. The atmosphere is dark and romantic. Service is absolutely impeccable, as they make you feel like family.

But the food steals the show here.

They bring great, homemade bread with oil and leeks to start. It was difficult not to fill up on the bread because it was so good. They also bring a platter of raw vegetables with dipping sauce.

I had the calamari for an appetizer. The portion was huge, and it was perfectly fried. Unlike a lot of calamari dishes, it was not overly heavy or greasy. The squid itself was unbelievably fresh. All in all an excellent dish.

The Caesar salad was great as well. It was dressed perfectly and the vegetables all had a great crisp. The dressing was clearly homemade, well balanced, with a strong hint of anchovy.

Most importantly, the steak was excellent. A perfect medium rare filet mignon with a nice hard char on the outside. It cut like butter with a good amount of marbling throughout the filet. The baked potato served alongside the filet was cooked well and served with sour cream.

For dessert, I had their famous strawberry shortcake. It was amazing!!! One of the largest desserts I've ever had. Every element of it was homemade.

All in all, one of the best steakhouses in America.",5

Chicken wasn't so bad..so I just ate the chicken and left the rice. Portions were small. My friend ordered a curry and some naan... The curry tasted good. However, Some of the stuff from the menu wasn't available. 

The waiter had really dirty hands and fingernails which grossed me out. Also his uniform was visibly dirty.

I originally went there to get my girlfriend's iPhone 6 screen fixed and ended up getting her a case too ( I cancelled an order I had placed that day from Amazon and bought her the same case from them for $15 cheaper). While I was there I asked about getting my home screen buttoned fixed on my iPhone 5s but he didn't have a new button in my color in stock. After looking around a bit he found a used part that he said may or may not work and he'd try it out for me. He fixed my girlfriends screen first (with an OEM screen and not a cheap knockoff) and once finished, checked out my phone. He threw in the home button and after about 5 mins said it was all fixed.. and at no charge!

Online they said they were open so I paid for the uber over and they had a open sign on the door, but building was locked. Inside also looked empty. Do not buy their Groupon, clearly a tourist scam.",1
6693,"Rating 4.5 stars

My husband and I went to 3 buffets while in Vegas and this was the best one. We went for Friday Brunch. 

They had this fantastic eggs Benedict with a hollandaise sauce that was to die for. I'm not lying. I almost licked my plate. 

I also had some French toast, and sausage and bacon (had to knock off .5 star here because the meat was cold-not sure why).

The dessert station was the best. They were all smaller so you can sample more. I had a white chocolate mousse. Drooool. 

Total price with endless mimosas for two : 76 (not including tip). Worth every penny!",5
6694,"I live in Vegas and wanted to bring my mom for a nice belated Mothers day Dinner with a View. I had made my reservation in advance but after reading previous reviews, i knew the patio was first come first serve. We got there on a Monday 50 min before our 6:45 reservation and the patio already had a 2 hour wait list. We had a drink and a app at the bar while we were waiting for our (near the window) seat & i was kind of bummed and thinking of going somewhere else. 

Just in time the hostess walked up & said she knew i wanted something special for my mom and she was able to get me the front row best view table on the patio. Right when we sat down, the fountain started the show and my mom was crying because it was so nice! (Naturally i tipped the host for her Epic service) 

Michelle was our server who was DA BEST and didn't rush us at all and recommended the best martinis and entrees. She even brought out a cute mothers day dessert for my mom at the end of the meal.  
I had the Veal ravioli & my mom the Steak which were both perfect but a little on the cold side. However, i didn't take away points because the service and ambiance were great. 

Definitely worth the price and wait! We will def. be back but only if we get to sit with Michelle!",5
6697,"Amazing spot! Great burgers, and our server Tasha made our experience so great. We came from Chicago to visit - it has a really cool sports feel and cozy seating.  Check it out --",5
6702,"I have to give props to the fantastic staff at this hotel! They are professional, proactive, and genuinely care about their guests.  Everything about our stay exceeded our expectations - except for one rouge guest who thought it would be a great idea to pull the fire alarm in the middle of the night. Despite the chaos and (rightfully) angry guests, the staff took care of the situation quickly and tactfully. I don't think I would have been able to handle the situation as well as they did. This could have been one of the worst nights I have ever spent at a hotel but it all turned out well in the end. We will definitely stay here again! Thank you Stephanie and the night staff for all your hard work!",5
6704,"I came here with a group of my friends for a going away dinner for one of them. My friends were already waiting for me and as I sat down the waiter , Anthony, was at our table but i don't even think he noticed that I got there because he didn't asked if I wanted a drink or anything. He stopped by our table every 20 minutes just to refill the water and barely even talked to us. When it came to ordering food I asked if the lamb sliders were good and he said they were his favorite. The lamb sliders came out and 50% of it was the bread so I took off the top bun and it was still disgusting. The duck fat fries were alright the fries were very hard. All in all I have no idea why this place has 4 stars the whole experience was awful and a waste of my money.",1
6706,"Arrived in Phoenix last night for my sisters wedding, we didn't know where we were going to go for our bridal nails, we received a referral from a friend local to the area. We were not disappointed! Quick service, shoulder massages, great color selection, bottled water made our experience wonderful. I highly recommend.",5
6707,"I was here last night visiting some friends. Having to come here, I really enjoyed this place. The Curry Lamb Burger with the Sweet Potato Curry soup is a great combination. The onion rings were amazing. Its nice place in the middle of Old Cabbagetown.",5
6708,"This place is just phenomenal! I decided to go based on the Yelp reviews, and, per usual, they were spot on. The ladies who work here are so nice and helpful. I felt very comfortable from the moment I walked through the door. While the specialize in bridal accessories, I even bought my wedding dress here! The selection they have is really lovely. I didn't know what to expect, since dresses are not their main business, but there was a lot to choose from and the quality was wonderful.  After I fell in love with my dress, they patiently help me accessorize. I spent a while trying things on and deciding, and they never made me feel rushed or pressured. It was overall just a really great experience. I highly recommend Clarissa to anyone in the process of wedding planning!",5
6709,"Joe's is my favorite place in Gilbert! Farm Fresh food, fun atmosphere, and great service. What more could I ask for! I try something different every time I go, but I always get that blackberry lemonade! So fresh and delicious. Living less than a mile from here is dangerous! Keep killing it Joe's!",5
6711,"My favorite spot in Pittsburgh for food! You'd think you'd be hard-pressed to find a remotely decent place for ethnic food in Pittsburgh (at least that's what we big city folk think).

But Pittsburgh is filled with little gems/charms. Spice Island being one of them. I never had something bad here, but try the Burmese Mohinga! It's a soup with thin noodles like no other. Richer than pho, and not as greasy as ramen, with a SE Asian flavor to it.

I'm tempted to make the 4 hour drive to Pittsburgh now just for this....",5
6712,"Arcadia Farms is by far the best lunch restaurant in scottsdale. The atmosphere is superb and has a unique, eclectic vibe. Everything on the menu is delicious, but every time I go, I always order the Brie with caramelized apples and the strawberry chicken salad (they never get old). A great place to have a baby or wedding shower since they have a private room. You will not be disappointed!",5
6713,Wow what a beautiful place .. Really nice and connected to the mall with all sorts of restaurants to choose from . The beds are awesome the room is nice and comfy had a little office really roomy bathroom . Plenty of room . Only gripe the room service was after 1 pm not sure why . That's really the only thing I can complain about ..,5
6716,Out for lunch shopping fresh bakery down. Nice place to eat Chili sauce on the table amazing with broken rice and fresh salad shrimp roll with peanut sauce,5
6719,"By far the best pool service I've ever experienced. I found this company on next door neighbor.com after reading all the positive reviews I gave them a call. The very next day someone was here in the time frame I was given to diagnose the problem. The following day we scheduled the repair. They showed up exactly when I was told and replaced my pool pump, cleaned my filters along with adding the I-aqua control system. They also did a few minor repairs my pool is running like new again. The owner and both guys that worked on my pool were very knowledgeable and professional. I will definitely be a returning customer.",5
6726,Great gym. Always kept spotless. Tons of equipment.  Trainers that know exactly what it takes to maximize performance and obtain your goals.,5
6727,"Finally a sandwich spot with freshly cut meat. Everything here is fresh and made to order. The owner Michael is such a caring person and you can tell he loves what he does. He gave me a sample of the meats with different sauces. I decided to order the homemade meatball sandwich and my friend ordered the chicken loco with fresh avocados. 

The meatball sub was delicious. Mike even gave me extra sauce which I recommend to everybody so you can dip your bread into. The meatballs were tender and seasoned just right. Not to salty but just right. 

I took a couple bites of the chicken loco and I must say the sauce was just right. It paired perfectly with the chicken. 

I can't wait to come back to try a couple more different sandwiches. 

If you're ever in the area make sure to try this place out. You won't be disappointed!",5
6728,"I didnt even up buying my Rx frames here but I have to take a couple off minuites of my precious (lol) time to review them.

I was here this morning Sat 04/28 to look around for a new first pair of Rx frames. My islander self loves wearing shorts and flipflops and I usually wear them everytime I go and buy something that I feel like I would get hustled from. But today I was such a mess as I havent slept all night sick from pregnancy. I looked so raggedy and felt I might get judged too much lol! But all three ladies on duty were super duper sweet! No judging, hustling, or anything that made me feel uncomfortable. Just top notch professionalism and friendliness. They didn't have a huge variety as other larger retail stores, but they deffinately had a very good collection not many other stores has! I immediately fell in love with a pair of Gucci (I forgot what model). Unfortunately I didn't end up getting my pair form them. I ended up going to LC Boca Park and found a pair of Versace. I have a funny right ear so fitting can be tricky for me. It literally took me 4 months to finally get my glasses because the last time I looked, I was disappointed as I never like what fits my ear properly. I really loved the Gucci from Eyediology. I was going to come back for it if I didn't find a perfect fitting one for me but I *had* to get the other :( I knew Eyediology didn't carry the brand. I wish they did as I really wanted to give them my business since they were awesome! Not that LC was so bad. I did feel a bit uncomfortable as I suspect they were working on commission since I entered the door. One attendant over voiced the other's greetings and had this energy that I'm hers. A bit more uncomfortable during the transaction too. I'm guessing because of the location. Anyway that's another review I talk too much lol. Anyway thank you ladies! I wish shopping for anything is as a breeze and soothing as my experience today at Eyediology.",5
6730,"This is some delicious pizza, I love all of the toppings they offer for many types of palets. The service is fast and friendly. There original crust is thin and crispy just the way i like it, but they also offer a thicker crust and a gluten-free crust as well. If you love pizza you should definitely put this on your list of places to try! Oh yeah one more thing. Their brownie is so very bad meaning amazing!",5

They get one star for the location and the coffee is okay.",1
6735,"I would avoid renting from this company. They never gave me required 30 day notice of rent increase. They also never return phone calls or emails. Claudia De La Rocha is rude and unprofessional. They also have been charging me late fees when I already paid my rent. They are a hassle and you will save time, money, and stress avoiding them.",1

6737,Saw Kolleen for a tattoo removal session a few days ago. She is an awesome person. She really tries to make the process very comfortable for her clients. She is very knowledgeable about what she does and explains every step of the process before and during the procedure. Totally would recommend her to whom ever would like to get their horrible tattoos removed!!,5

6740,"Tried this for the first time yesterday.  

My husband and I shared food from the hot table - a beef meatball-type of thing covered in a nice gravy with onions.  We chose to enjoy it with two cold salads: coleslaw and potato salad.  The beef was moist and juicy and the gravy with onions added a nice contrast to the meat.  The coleslaw was nice and light.  The potato salad was my favourite of the two salads - it tasted really fresh and the potatoes were cooked just right.

We asked for a cherry jam cookie and americano to finish our afternoon ""snack"" and the server added an almond sugar cookie to try.  The cherry jam cookie was really good - the jam was really tasty and made me wish we had gotten a few more of these.  The almond sugar cookie tasted like my mother-in-law's christmas cookies (which are very good) but were even better.

I like the fresh decor and the friendly staff.  The food tastes fresh and is very well executed.

Nice addition to the neighbourhood - I can't wait to go back.  I'd like to try one of their open-faced sandwiches or the brunch next time we go.",5
6743,"The comment that the company provided on my previous review  was left over a year AFTER this situation. This should demonstrate the promptness of this company. I received a $50 refund for the scrap book I did not receive, which was less than half of my total bill.",1
6746,"The interior of this hotel looks great except for the fact that it's under construction and we had to go through Best Western for hotel access. The rooms are spacious and visually it's a stunning hotel for their reservation price. But let me tell you the story of how HORRIBLE this place is, and no I'm not making this up.

My friend booked this hotel ONE year in advance and when she checked to see if it was in the system..NO RECORD. Fine, moving on. The hotel gave the wrong room arrangement (i.e. incorrect room number). Not to mention, the manager stood my friend TWICE and did not show up to answer any of her questions. Did I mention that she was booking a presidential suite for her WEDDING? Cue in the important night, we booked the room for FOUR people and we were presented with 1 bed. You know what, perhaps you could have given us an extra bed? A presidential suite with 1 bed for 4 people, but we can forgive this since they told us it's a surcharge per person to add extra beds. The day my friend checked in, a light bulb was broken and it took them 30 minutes to repair it. Great. Now it's night time and we asked for more pillows. The front desk staff had the nerve to ask us how many pillows we have in our room because they would only send us ONE. One pillow...what in the world? Next, we had to remind them again that they forgot to send us that ONE pillow and blanket sheets.

In no way am I pointing fingers at only the hotel manager (name removed for confidentiality purposes) and I am not asking for a compensation. Just trying to write down my experience and frustrations as a whole. It's not to say that the hotel didn't have positives and I truly feel that they accommodated us by setting up an earlier breakfast time. I really really wanted to enjoy my stay here and the room itself was awesome - great place for a pre-wedding hang out. It was unfortunate what transpired and hopefully no one has to go through this again.",1
6751,"Great instructors. This place offers everything I would want while working out. Whether it is sculpting, toning, cardio, or yoga. This place offers it. I would definitely recommend it.",5
6753,"I was really bummed when I heard Kitchen 56 closed. It was relief to hear they were remodeling and revamping the restaurant. They finally reopened a few days ago and I had the pleasure of checking them out during happy hour today. 

It's a much smaller, location, completely different look and what seems to be a new staff. Granted I did not eat anything, and just had a drink. I really like the new vibe. It feels more intimate and something out of San Francisco. The staff was super friendly and almost pumped to be apart of the new kitchen 56. The bartender with the short platinum hair was really sweet and instantly made me feel like she's been serving me for years. From what I can tell they still have a great patio. Definitely smaller, which I like. I'm excited to come back and check out the food menu. Sometimes change is good. And that definitely seems to be the case here.",5
6754,"Awful.  I didn't know how bad it was until I went to a different GE and saw how good it could be.  The lines are long, the produce selection is minimal, and the store is overcrowded.

The last straw was yesterday when the cashier blew her nose, stuck kleenex up her nose, then put it back in her pocket and continued to scan groceries.  When I complained to the manager, they denied any of their employees were sick.

I'm done shopping at this store.",1
6755,THE WORST DAY! Bus broke down on the side of the road two hours from the Grand Canyon. Been waiting for four hours for a replacement bus. Toilet paper ran out an hour ago and there are 50 people on this bus. Nothing to eat all day but a pastry they gave us at checkin. Will not get to see the Grand Canyon as it will be too late to see anything. Fun day driving 6 hours to see nothing. Get better buses!,1

6760,I recently rented a storage unit here.  I payed them the unit during the week and I told them I wasn't moving in until that weekend. Well weekend came and I had all my stuff packed in my car and I get to my unit and it's locked with a sticker saying rent me? Like really? I paid for this unit already! And of course office is closed at this time! Then today I tried to get to my unit and the gate won't open!! Again my car is packed with stuff! I understand office hours are closed but gate shouldn't be!!,1
6761,"Had great expectations for this restaurant and was highly disappointed.  Arrived early and sat in the lounge.  My husband had to go to the bar to get drinks for us since the server was nowhere to be found and never acknowledged our presence.  I had a mojito and there was no visible mint in my drink.  WTH!  Was seated at our table at the time of our reservation. The server told us that we could NOT order an appetizer first, that we must order our entire meal to include wine at one time, end of discussion.  Okay we make our choices and order about 10 minutes later.  Still no bread.  Wait about 15 minutes for appetizers, they are brought.  Then finally some bread is brought out.  We ordered the bacon wrapped dates and the olives and they were meh!  The warm bread was covered in salt, so much so that my husband the sodium freak said it was too much for him.  I had the shrimp with spaghetti while my spouse had the lamb.  My pasta was clumpy and overcooked as were the two shrimp I received with it.  My husband's lamb was ordered medium rare and was received as  well done.  Both appetizers lacked seasoning and we were not offered any  parmesan for the pasta or salt/pepper for any of our food.  On a side note, the portions are incredibly  small.  My sister lives in Vicenza Italy and I thave traveled there on a frequent basis for the past 30 years, 3-4 times a year and this is not Italian food or service.  The waiter asked how we were enjoying our meal and we told him.  No one from management approached us.  We did not order dessert because the majority of it appeared dried out.  My husband did order coffee for after dinner.  This was a total waste of our time and money.",1
6763,"Just finished getting my first tattoo from Nick Bones and can't say enough about how satisfied I am.

6768,"this review is strictly for the espresso:

Kafa Buna serves a delicious semi-ristretto smooth espresso. it was tangy and slightly sweet with no harsh bitter aftertaste on par with top 3rd Wave shops in the Pittsburgh area (Tazzo, 21st st., Common, etc.) though lighter in body.

i gem in the NewKen area.",5

6771,8 handicapper- I was thoroughly impressed with this course. Just air rated and can barely tell. Greens were fast and true. Fairways were green and lush. Bunkers are mostly tall and tough with more crushed rock than sand. Water holes are picturesque with fountains and lillypads. Nice enough to swim in. Driving range has plenty of room and targets. Clubhouse team are super nice too. A++++++,5

I visited over 15 vets and Hillside was far and away the friendliest, cleanest, nicest with most knowledgeable staff. OMG... love them... LOVE. 

Every time I walked into Hillside I was immediately greeted with a smile and a hello.

I guarantee they are the best vet!!",5
6787,"Checked this place out based on recommendations from some of my Canadian friends and I wasn't disappointed. Food is really good and the service was exceptional. Next time I'm in Canada I will definitely be back. 
To start off we got the Margarita pizza to share and it was very good. Just the right amount of basil and mozzarella to match. The bread with oil & vinegar was also a great starting touch. 
For our meals we all got separate pasta dishes. My dish was very good and my friends really enjoyed theirs as well. One friend did say that the meatballs didn't ""taste fresh"" but she enjoyed the pasta. Aside from her tiny complaint we enjoyed everything about this place. 
Not only was the food great but the service was exceptional. Every surrounding waiter/ waitress was very charismatic, genuine and extremely helpful. Will definitely be back next time I'm in the country. It's a great choice if you're craving Italian food and are in the area.",5

How to decide?! This was truly a complete and total culinary experience. The many flavors were subtle but distinct as they exploded on my tongue.  I can't get back soon enough! My only disappointment was the packaged sugar with the cappuccino. Suggestion...white and brown sugar cubes are a nice touch.",5
6790,First time here but we loved the breakfast. This restaurant is just a little cheaper than eating on the Vegas  strip but the food quality was better than some of the strip options so it was worth the 3 mile drive out on our way back to LA. There wasn't a long wait for a party of two but the place did look a little busy but this was okay for a Saturday morning.,5

6799,"This small company sucks. I went in years ago to look at leasing a used 2003 e320 wagon. they were price and terms competing against two other dealers for my business. Figures they worked out we just below others and to the same specifics
.I  just came out of a finance lease and let them know clearly i did not want any such lease. i wanted a walk away and this is what they were offering., w  maintained the car with full service and care. came to the time of the return and all hell broke loose. the finance company had never heard of a walk away lease that the dealership had said they arreange to compete with the others. they would not pick up the car for months. Rose at azores then said we should have addressed the details of the lease with council ratther then Tito's the dealership owner.
We requested a walk away and thats what we were signing. 
Also we were now told  the vehicle had been in a headon colision and the damage of around 3000 was minimal, just a left fender. Paperwork had been signed.
The was later to reveal itself a rollback on the odometer in the amount of 100000 kms plus or minus.
Avoid his crooked place at all costs and run don't walk across his sidewalk on College street.
I paid three grand more to the lease company to honor what i signed while being lied to as it was explained. Run from this guys lot and count your lucky stars you did. I will continue to tell my story to keep those looking away from here.
Jim Pedemsky leaseing is the other culprit in this as the lease is theirs and they trust these car dealers to oversee the contract signing and communication.
I asked them how they can have agents outside the realm and control explain their contracts in such a dishonest manner. Its not their problem and the buyer needs to beware.",1
6800,"There was a reason we were the only people in the restaurant. First time going, so we asked the server (blonde with mole on face) a couple of questions about the menu. As she rolled her eyes and gave a stupid look, she said, ""I don't know, I don't cook the food."" I ordered the pulled chicken dinner and received the pulled pork dinner. When I told her I ordered the chicken, she kept shaking her head no and told me I ordered the pork. She said she could get me the chicken but was clearly annoyed. She even talked me in to getting the pulled chicken dinner vs the pulled chicken sandwich bcz it came with two sides, and I told her it's the same cost if I add on extra sides. The pork cost more. I just ate the pork because I didn't feel like arguing. After all of this, the food was mediocre, luke warm, not freshly cooked, dry meat, and bad service. It tasted like it was all leftovers warmed up in the microwave. Freshly cooked food would not be luke warm.  The food took longer than expected since we were the only people in there. 
Don't waste your money!",1

6804,Purchased the yelp deal. Went in at 8:30 and was greeted by the owner and his family. Ordered the Greek salad and the dressing was amazing. Wings with BBQ sauce were meaty and tasty. Ordered the Natali special pizza and the Spinach with Chicken pizza. They were one of the best pizzas I've had.,5
6805,My husband and I visited Ashley's a few days ago and were greeted by Codee.  He was awesome.  We were looking at mattresses and found Codee to be extremely knowledgeable and polite!  I highly recommend asking for him if you go in.  This is my first review on Yelp.   It takes a lot to impress me with sales people!!,5
6806,"Great food, great service and the atmostphere is fun. It does get a little loud, but if you go in with that expectation you'll be fine.",5
6808,First time eating at Wong's and this is honestly the best Chinese cuisine restaurant I've ever been to. The entire staff was welcoming and super nice. The food is just amazing. Would recommend them to anyone.,5
6813,"This place is pricy I will admit, but I would say it is worth it for special occasions. The cupcakes were delicious, they even made me a little chocolate sign that said happy birthday for me!",5
6815,"Dr. Michael Smith is a great physician. Focused, patient, understanding and thorough. A true gem in today's productivity based healthcare. His colleagues and staff are first class so, even if you don't chose him consider Gilbert Internal Medicine for all of your primary care needs.",5
6816,"Horrible. One of their Doctors is a complete pervert and always finds an excuse to bring up sex in a conversation. He's very chatty and gross. At first I mistook him for a friendly yet perverted old man and told my husband to take my son there. He was very rude to my husband and didn't care or even listen to anything my husband had to say yet my appointment was an hour long, listening to him babble. And that was after the hour wait in lobby WITH a scheduled appointment.  I will NOT return.",1
6820,"My college roommate and I were having a reunion weekend for the Thanksgiving holiday. No better way to catch up than with a few drinks and some great food for dinner. He told me this place has great burgers, and it sounded perfect. We came on a Wednesday (it was bingo night - looks fun, I'll play next time for sure). Immediately found a seat at the bar - which was perfect. The two bartenders were attentive, funny, and took great care of us.  The menu is diverse and interesting. I got the burger with quest dip, tortilla chips, and guacamole. It was really delicious and fun to try something wild and delicious at the same time. I highly recommend this place for friends, families, anyone looking for a casual, good time at reasonable prices. It's excellent!  **Their manager Sal checked in our meal and was friendly to the regulars sitting near us. We also witnessed Sal handling a situation involving a patron who had been served a little too much. Sal was extremely professional and handled the situation in the absolute best way possible.",5
6821,There are a few people I would leave my dogs with but these two have really won me over they have 100% of my trust my English mastiff has bone cancer which is making his leg come out of place I have attempted to take him to many different people but they are too afraid or refuse to because of his health issue I have never seen him so clean and so well done I've also took my pug who has separation anxiety who cries and screams when I leave but these two have won his trust they really are both the most amazing groomers I wouldn't trust anyone else,5
6822,"First thing I noticed- the smell. Smelled really weird for a bagel shop. Customer service wasn't that great either. It took FOREVER to get my order. I asked for 1 toasted bagel (with no line in front of me) and it took about 10 minutes to get it. Also, my bagel was cold, not toasted.",1
6825,"I had lunch here with my wife and two year old twins. We arrived at 11:00am on Saturday right after the restaurant opened. The food was excellent. I had a breakfast burrito and my wife had chicken tamales. The chips were great and came with three different salsas. 

The service was also excellent, however there were only about five other customers since we were there so early. 

If this was located closer to my house I would be here all the time. I will have to settle for stopping by whenever I am lured to the northwest part of town",5
6826,I've had lunch at Umai four times and each time it has been outstanding!  Not a sushi lover so thoroughly enjoy the chinese menu. My favorite dish is Basil Shrimp with extra basil! We received excellent and personable service. Bobby was our waiter and made sure we were well taken care of. I live nearby so thrilled to find this excellent restaurant! HIGHLY recommend!,5
6827,Easily the worst post office I have ever been to period.  Long lines and employees that are not friendly at all.  They need another post office in the centennial area of town to accommodate the citizens that live here.  One is clearly not enough.,1
6828,"Tried them out because of a promotion and I was nothing but impressed. They have a variety of services offered, I had my house cleaned. The price is very reasonable and the staff is very professional. I was very hesitant at having someone come in and clean my house but I recently broke my leg and tore some ligaments and it was just getting out of control. She came in, was pleasant, asked me what I wanted and how I wanted it done. I am going to keep up with them during my injury but honestly they are that good that I will keep them after it is healed as well because it just takes that stress out of my life. I'm obsessed with them. If you haven't given them a try I would suggest it. You can probably find a first try coupon with them to give them a try which will give you a 50% off too!! Google it! Then once you use it, you can share it with your friends and you get 50$ off your next cleaning and so does your friend! :) best of luck.",5
6829,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley! The aji pizza is my favorite- a little spicy, but some of the best pizza I've ever had. They also have a ton of beers on tap and the owners are super nice too!",5
6831,"I don't know about the dayclub as I didn't get in and my 7 friends did o this bachelor party trip. Supposedly u need to wear board shorts to get in which wasn't told to me on the phone or on my presale ticket when I asked. They just said shorts. So I canned it all the way back to my hotel which took 30 min, and came back with swimming shorts, and the same bouncer did not lemme in cuz they weren't ""board shorts"". Waviest sh*t ever. So they wouldn't lemme return my presage ticket either. So I wasted $35 with the ticket and cab fare and still didn't get in. A-holes!!",1
6832,"I guess it's the place where, people who are not able to travel farther or people who don't watch their eating habits would shop.  
I just stop there to grab milk, egg,bread. 
It's a total disrespect to the costumers to find rotten produce on the shelfs and find  something as simple as ginger or cilantro is a miracle.",1
6833,"Easy to work with, great limo and loved Steven, the driver.  Thank you, Platinum!",5
6834,"Just bad overall the only good thing was the air conditioning in the casino floor were do I start , my wife and I thought let's go to Vegas for the weekend 1st outing in a while since we just had a baby . Fast forward and to the point , the rooms are small I paid extra for a strip view my view was the back of another hotel then the showers the water leaked into the bathroom through the glass door that is there to keep the water in we had to use almost all the towels to soak up the water , we reported it and no response none to fix it or move us to another room then the doors the doors to each room slam shut all day all night slam slam slam on top of the that the walls are paper thin , and the worst part is not only does vegas hotels not only charge for valet and parking now but when we checked out there were fees I did not recognize and the big one when we got our truck back from valet some had stole our check book from our glove compartment",1
6835,Wonderful service (Thanks Penny) Excellent food! Best Happy Hour in town. Football games going on every channel & they are truly happy to see you!!,5
6836,"This caf√© and restaurant near my house is a must. 
They have a huge selection of homemade breads, bagels, pretzels to eat there or to bring back home. 
Their everything bagel is the best one I've had in my life (and I'm from Montreal!)
They have a cute little terrasse in the back during the summer. The place sits 20 people inside I would say. 
They always have homemade specials on the weekend and there's always something to please everyone. Their homemade breakfast sausage is a crowd pleaser. Like you would even skip bacon for that shit. 
The breakfast casseroles are HUGE and so good, with seasonal veggies, meat, potatoes, eggs and cheese.",5
6837,"Lloyd's is super fun and affordable! I used the rentals and they were comfortable. They should have an adult night though, those little children are dangerous, I saw a couple wipeouts due to an experienced skater going fast and a kid suddenly stopping or changing direction. I almost ran some kids over because they turned around and started skating the other way.",5
6839,"I came to the place expecting to be disappointed given the moderately high prices, the location and the fact that it was fairly empty at the time. However, the amount of food that I was served definitely justified the price. My boyfriend and I ordered falafel fries, the spicy chicken wrap and the lentil soup. All that ended up providing us both with two meals! Pretty good value if you ask me. Plus, the lentil soup and spicy chicken wrap were delicious. The falafel fries were pretty good, but a little dry. I would order everything again.

I encourage everybody to try this place!",5
6841,"I have came here 3 times so far to purchase rings and necklaces. I have always had a very pleasant time here. PLEASE if you go here ask for FONDA. She is the sweetest lady ever! I am really the most indecisive person when selecting something for myself.  A month ago I purchased a ring and thought I loved it but it turned out I was having mixed feelings, I came back in for a second time and found the ring of my dreams!! All thanks to Fonda. She was extremely patient with me! She also helped me pick out my ring! I have to say she truly cares about her customers more than anything. She even texted me herself to let me know my ring was done early because she knew I had been waiting! She is truly amazing.
Thank you Fonda for being so patient and taking care of me!",5
6844,Amazing Dim sum and an awesome experience all around. Do yourself a favor and try everything. You never know what may become your new favorite item.,5
6845,Show was remarkable. He is so entertaining. I was laughing so hard I had tears. I went to the meet and great and was star struck. He has the bet smile and so inviting. I would highly recommend his show. So worth the price of the tickets!!!!  I will see him again.,5
6846,"My Dad is Maltese, so I was exposed to Maltese baking from a young age.  We used to come here a few times per year as a family when I was younger, and it was always a treat.  Now, I'm overjoyed to have moved just down the street, which means pastizzi whenever I want!

The place hasn't changed much in decades, and that's a good thing.  It's a lovely little cafe with great food and friendly staff.  Just bring cash - they don't take debit.",5

6852,"I completely trusted the reviews when I went to book amelia c and co and probably the best decision I made for my wedding! It was for a wedding last Thursday and I had me plus 9 other girls who got makeup and hair done with Delaney, Melissa and Bianca . They were right on time and listened to each and one of our request. I know a couple of us were very specific and picky and they all listened. everyone loved their hair and make up! Even my husband was in awe of how I looked that night! All my blemishes were gone! Prompt, excellent customer service and very talented girls! I swear you won't regret booking  them on your special event!",5
6853,"After ordering, the wait was entirely too long, especially for just nachos. The menu needs to be a little bit more specific on exactly what is in each item and what the choices are for each item.",1
6854,"The food came cold and after a very long time. 
The beer tap didn't work. 
Bad experience overall. We will not be back.",1
6858,"Food:
I had an order of the mutton kothu. This dish is basically diced up roti, mutton, egg, onion, peppers, and curry. The mutton kothu here is by far one of the best I've had in Scarborough. Though it is very spicy, you can ask for it mild or not spicy. The blend and texture of each ingredient is perfect and compliments each other perfectly. NO DINE IN, TAKE OUT AND CATERING ONLY. The portion for the kothu is good and it will fill you up for sure!

Service:
The service was good. It was an in and out process. Not much talking or greeting but the job was done. The restaurant here before was named gasa but the chef is the same person.

Decor:
The ambiance is quite basic but it's a restaurant mainly based off take out and catering so it's fine. Everything looks clean!

Price:
The price is good and the dish costed me $6.50 which is cheaper than most places as well!",5
6864,"Don't let the fact this place is in a gas station fool you.  Extremely clean, and the food is fresh and good!  Nachos are amazing.  The main guy that works is fast and nice.",5
6865,"Had service with them for almost 3 years.  HORRIBLE.

Would have changed but had no reasonable, affordable alternative at the time.  (In the beginning there were no other options; at the end there were no other options that did not have a long-term commitment which didn't work for us because we knew we were moving.)

Paid for the ""fast"" internet--but it was painfully slow.

On demand literally never worked.  It was horribly frustrating to pay for something we never got.

DVR never worked right either.  We might get a couple weeks of working right here and there, but always it would go back to failure mode.  We repeatedly changed boxes, both through driving to the office and waiting in line (great way to spend a day off by the way), or having techs come out to the house.  We had problems such as things not recording even when programed to record, only half of the show recording, erasing recordings for no reasons, some boxes would erase  shows even though the box was only 1/4 full.  However, the most frustrating part was that our shows would tape often with visual disturbances (can't watch), or no sound at all. 

As I said, we repeatedly drove to the office to exchange boxes, had techs come out to change them out too.  Each person told us a new ""reason"" for the difficulties.  Some would say we were given the wrong kind of box.  (Interestingly they kept changing us back and forth between the same kind of boxes--each person telling us that we should have the other kind of box.) 

Worked through the phone techs, had repeated service calls--nothing ever worked.  They even ran a new cable line to our house, but they were never able to get it working right.

Customer service was horrible.  Long wait times on the phone only to be treated rudely.  One of the techs completely creeped-out/scared  my kids and I, but for the most part they were decent (although ineffective).

Looking back, we should have closed our account long, long ago--even if it meant paying the early termination fee.

Oh, I almost forgot to mention....there were frequent billing errors that were almost impossible to get fixed!  Never high dollar amounts but enough to add up over the course of a year.",1
6866,"I have recently moved to Cleveland and always wanted to try a reform Pilates class. ReForm is amazing and I highly recommend it for anyone wanting a great workout, and uniquely fun and  different from the norm.",5
6867,"They do not return phone calls.
Girl answering calls is pathetically clueless.

Called 2 weeks ago for an estimate. 
Gave the girl who answered all of the detailed information she asked for. 

One week goes by.... Nothing.

I call back.
Same girl answers... says there is no record of my call last week. um ok.
Give all my info again. 
She tells me they will get back to me. 
I ask when. 
She tells me she has no idea. 
She was clueless and disinterested in a potential customer. 
Made me feel like I was wasting her time.

Now another week has passed and Nothing...

Take a look at all their negative Yelp reviews.
That should tell you something.",1
6868,"We had an absolutely lovely two night stay at the Dunhill. The hotel is located right in the middle of all the action, so we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. Rooms and beds were on the smallish side, but the beds were comfortable and the shower was roomy with good water pressure. There was a refrigerator stocked with complimentary water and the complimentary breakfast got the job done. 

What really made this a 5 star experience though, was the staff. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. Take Pete for example. Pete is the resident bartender and socialite extraordinaire. 90% of the patrons greeted him with a hug and a kiss. Not only does Pete make a great drink, he makes great conversation. He also introduced us to several locals who were able to give us insider information on what to check out around town. Plus, he remembered our names and drink preferences. It's little details like that, that make a big impression.",5
6869,"This review is for the Wrongfully Accused and Cabin rooms. My friend and I are addicted to escape rooms and naturally, we had to check out this place while in Vegas. I purchased a Groupon for Wrongfully Accused and the process was really easy. I was able to book the room the same day I purchase the Groupon, which I really appreciated since there was another room from another company who refused to do this. The room was relatively easy and we were able to escape in 45 minutes. We came back the following day to do the Cabin and this room was definitely more challenging, but we loved it!
Overall my friend and I really enjoyed our experience at lockdown and the customer service was amazing! :)",5

She really knew how to boost my self love! I was never a huge fan of threading, but she's extremely affordable and makes the experience enjoyable, with amazing results to boot! She's quick and personable! She blows me away with the things she remembers when I only see her once a month. I always look forward to seeing her.",5

6883,We bought a house in April 2011 and Dave was our Realtor. He did an excellent job. He was patient and made sure we got exactly what we were looking for. He was honest with us about the houses we looked at. He did not try to just sell us a house; he made sure we were getting the best value & a home we could spend our lives in. He was in constant communication with our lender so he was up to date on our searches so we could close on our home as soon as possible. Highly recommend Dave to anyone looking to buy a home in the Phoenix and surrounding areas!!,5
6884,"I have gone here for two consecutive years to get my checkup/prescription for my contacts/glasses. Both times, the staff were very nice and accomodating. They even offer you water in the waiting area.

The last time I went was a month ago. My optometrist was Dr Diana Yu. She was very nice and gave me a lot of tips to keep my eyes healthy and how to prevent infections from wearing my contacts.

I forgot to ask for an official receipt and had to call today to ask for one. They gave me no difficulty at all and they will send it to me via e-mail.

Definitely recommend.",5

6889,This is a really nice spacious park you'd never think was in the heart of the city. I'd like to come here when there's fewer people around. It's probably more peaceful. They have also renovated it a bit. I'd never been here before until July 4th.,5
6890,Best hotdog I have had in a long time! The first time I went there I got the columbian and it was a perfect combination of tastes. The fries are amazing too. My boyfriend has tried several of the dogs on the menu but always comes back to the columbian. It is surely the best in his opinion. The 2nd time I went to Simon's I was not super hungry and just ordered a plain hotdog with ketchup and mustard. The bun alone is just amazing. I am getting hungry thinking about it. The quality of the hotdog meat is very obviously good quality. I love this addition to old town scottsdale!,5

6898,"Susan in the finance department needs an attitude adjustment. I was rear ended on the freeway (3 times) and my car was totaled, so I needed to get a refund on the extended warranty for my GAP insurance. I was told Susan would be right with me as soon as she was finished with someone else. Well about 30-45 minutes pass (she walked by me twice) and I asked someone if she was ready to see me.. She was just sitting in her office pretty much ignoring me. I can deal with that- no biggie maybe she was having a rough day and wanted to relax for a few moments, I get it. But the attitude and rudeness that followed was unacceptable. I'd never had to do anything like this before so I was asking questions and making sure I was doing everything right and she was so rude with her responses and seemed so annoyed with me! And I'm a very nice person! So nice that I just took it when she shooed me away saying ""We are finished here."" not even a smile or a ""have a nice day!"". This was back in May. My car troubles are sorted out now, so I decided to write a review on my genuinely horrible experience, not with the dealership, but with Susan in finance. Susan I hope you're reading this, check the 'tude girl and spread some kindness.",1
6900,"This place exemplifies what happens when you put fresh, simple ingredients together with a staff that cares.  The food is simple but delicious. My ""We are the North"" pulled pork sandwich has been perfect on every occasion I've had to visit and try it. 

Upon the one occasion something didn't meet with my expectation, a case of me ordering something that probably didn't go with my sandwich, the owner offered me a complimentary dessert simply because he didn't want me to go away unhappy despite the fact that it was thirty minutes after the restaurant had closed for the night.

My wife and I both have nothing but praise for this eatery.",5
6901,"I stopped here with my mother for a weekday breakfast. She usually likes the mom and pop greasy spoons, but I was able to talk her into something different. Holy Toledo are we both glad we did. I got the pudding French toast, and she had the corned beef hash. I have never ever enjoyed corned beef hash in my life. Now I don't want to eat anything but this corned beef hash. The corned beef is sliced thin and placed on top of potato latkes fried crispy but still soft inside, topped with two perfectly cooked sunny side up eggs. My French toast was delicious and had boozy syrup drizzled over top. Grown up and decadent. Coffee is excellent and local. Decor is reminiscent of magnolia farms, but chip and Joanna would be proud. Service is also excellent and clear that it is a personal venture. Really enjoyed this spot. Please come and support the pants off this place. I need more smoked pork belly in my life.",5
6903,"I have the pleasure of arranging incentive trips and other events for the company I work at.  I'm always looking for new, unique, high quality and, at times, adrenaline-filled activities for our guests. 

Whenever we are in Las Vegas for an incentive trip, I always schedule a dune buggy outing. It always receives great feedback from the groups and I have never had anyone return with an issue.. just a lot of dust and fun stories. 

Coordinating a group can be a challenge, but everyone at Sun Buggy is wonderful to work with, very professional and acomodating. I am always impressed, which why we are going back for a third time with our group!

The transportation is always on time, the dune buggies are always functional and maintained and the guides are great! The cost is very reasonable for what you get. We do the mini Baja chase. Super fun!!

I would highly recommend this outing for groups and to special events coordinators. It is a blast and a great company to work with.",5
6906,"I came here for the first time yesterday. They have Chinese food!

We ordered Mongolian Beef, Salt & Pepper Squid, Salt & Pepper Pork, and Chicken Katsu.

I must say that their Chinese food is far better than their Hawaiian food. The squid and pork are just spiced enough to keep your lips tingling. The beef is deliciously marinated. The katsu was a disappointment though. You can get chicken katsu anywhere else and it would be better.

Salt & Pepper Squid and Salt & Pepper Pork is a MUST TRY!",5
6907,"I was sitting in this very lounge, reading the reviews, and half of the information mentioned is outdated, or just a complete lie. This place definitely seems like it was recently renovated. Someone mentioned that there's no bathroom (spoiler: there is, and it even has a shower!) and someone else mentioned that the lounge stinks. That's totally a lie. Let me the voice of truth and reason.

Yes, this lounge is accessible with Dining Club, Priority Pass, or one other lounge membership pass (I forgot). This lounge isn't associated with British Airways, but there's quite the crowd shortly before BA flights.

Even not during peak hours, there's cold food (think salad, cold sandwiches, chips, granola bars, etc.), soup, a full bar with low to medium shelf liquor freely flowing, and even an all-in-one coffee/espresso/hot chocolate maker. 

The service is great. They clean off your table for you every 10 minutes during peak hours, and every 20 minutes otherwise. The barkeep was also very friendly, and was open to making some weird cocktails (pineapple mimosas!). The glassware stays clean and stocked.

All in all, they made my continuously delayed stay in the airport far more pleasant than I could have ever imagined.

Also, this is the lounge in the E concourse. Don't get this one mixed up with the one in the D concourse. That one is different, and worse.",5

6927,"I stopped by this restaurant to grab a few drinks after a long day at work. This restaurant is conveniently located close to the entrance of the Grand Canal Shoppes in The Venetian Resort. The restaurant is unique with it being one of only a few restaurants that offer seating along and prime views of the Grand Canal inside the resort. We decided to sit at the bar. I was addressed by the bartender in a way that I did not appreciate and was not politically correct for lack of better words. The comment was based on my appearance. Even after standard business practices like checking a guest's ID to verify qualifications about someone like age, the bartender continued to address me in a way that was obviously not accurate. I was very embarrassed by this as I was put in a very awkward and uncomfortable position of deciding whether or not to address it or ignore it. I was embarrassed as the company I was with definitely noticed and heard the comments. I felt that the intention to incorrectly address me was not malicious but it was definitely ignorant and pretty much ruined my experience here. It's unfortunate because the cocktails were decent. Rare and impactful guest issues like this unfortunately leave little opportunity for guest recovery and needless to say I will not be returning nor recommending this restaurant to anyone in the future.",1

6932,"Le B√¢timent B est l'endroit par excellence pour toutes les occasions. Situ√© dans une ancienne b√¢tisse sur l'√Æle des Moulins dans le Vieux Terrebonne, ce restaurant offre une cuisine de style tapas, mais en employant des ingr√©dients du terroir. En plus d'utiliser des aliments locaux, le menu varie au fil des saisons permettant ainsi de renouveler l'exp√©rience tout au cours de l'ann√©e. Pour ma part, cela fait d√©j√† 2 fois que j'y vais avec ma copine pour le repas du soir et chaque fois, nous d√©couvrons de nouveaux plats. De plus, pour ceux qui se sentent plus aventuriers, il existe une formule Festin √† partir de 40$ qui est une carte blanche. Le serveur (tous excellents et sympas) vous am√®ne donc une s√©rie de plats et il vous les d√©cris au fur et √† mesure.

En plus d'offrir le service du soir, le B√¢timent B est aussi ouvert le dimanche de 10h √† 15h pour vous offrir le brunch. Encore une fois, une formule √† la carte ou festin vous sont offertes et je peux vous assurer que vous allez ressortir le ventre plein et que votre souper sera l√©ger. Le stack de pancakes, le bacon √©pais, les mimosas y sont au rendez-vous.

Enfin, durant la saison estivale, vous pouvez profiter de la magnifique terrasse aux abords de la rivi√®re des Milles-Iles. Un menu bistro bar est offert avec le bbq ext√©rieur pour ceux qui veulent manger. De plus, vous pouvez profiter de la grande vari√©t√© de bi√®res et des cocktails maisons qui vous sont offerts pour apaiser votre soif.

Le B√¢timent B est l'endroit par excellence pour boire un verre au soleil, prendre un brunch le dimanche matin ou d√©guster un repas de roi bien de chez nous.",5
6933,"Ordered via phone for a lunch pick-up. The hostess was not the friendliest over the phone, but despite that, we decided to order the crab cakes and fish tacos. I asked for salads for both orders and waited several minutes for the total. I was told our food would be ready in 15 minutes. I arrived 25 minutes later and was greeted by, who I assume to be the manager, he accepted my cash payment and proceeded to the back to retrieve my order. Here's where the lack of customer service becomes noticeably apparent. The hostess, who I assume took my order, returns to the front. For at least 5 minutes, she did not greet me nor acknowledge me. She didn't ask me if I was helped, if I wanted to be seated...nothing. Finally, a cook who walked up from the back of the house, kindly asked if I've been helped and I replied that I was being helped by the gentleman who retreated to the back. The hostess, however, still couldn't be bothered to ask me anything. Anyway, 10 minutes have now passed and the gentleman returns with my order. He indicates that the bread isn't ready and I would have to wait 10 more minutes. I told him that we would forgo it. As I looked through the order, I realized that 2 different salad sizes were provided - a very small container of just lettuce...seriously and a larger container with tomatoes, nuts, etc. I questioned why the sizes were different. It was explained that the salad for the crab cakes was an up-charge. I countered by stating I asked for salads as the sides for both meals and each meal comes with a side, so they should be same. His explanation was deficient as he stated with the crab cakes, salad is an up-charge and again, I didn't understand why an up-charge (larger salad) wasn't provided for the tacos. Additionally, when I reviewed my receipt, I didn't see an up-charge reflected for this meal. Furthermore, the hostess did not indicate or explain any of this during the call. The food was mediocre at best. My fish was overcooked and while I asked all condiments to be on the side, someone thought it made sense to place sour cream in the container with the hot food. Of course the salads were horrific, mine was just a toddler's handful of lettuce whereas my sister's looked and tasted old. She was scared to eat the cheese because it didn't look fresh. Crab cakes were ok - cold and falling apart, but at least edible. So, it looks like we won't be dining here again because the standard to which we were accustomed to has significantly lowered since our last visit. Just sad!",1
6934,"The burgers are delicious and BIG! Also the Monday special for $6 is still serving the same quality burgers.
Music: very Irish
Service: very friendly, good and fast
Menu card: many items - give it a try",5

Come here for the Mexican, stay for the food.  (see what I did there?)

But seriously though...",5
6936,"I have gone to David for a few years on minor things such as watch batteries, watch cleaning and minor jewelry repair. My mother is in town and wanted her original wedding ring and stone repaired or reset. She visited David and he quickly identified the issues with the current setting and suggested he fix it rather than taking a more expensive route with a brand-new setting. He knew this was sentimental and she agreed. The work was done quickly and is top notch. She is very happy but I'm not surprised given David's attitude, work ethic and customer service couldn't be better.",5
6937,Probably my favorite place ever. I go out of my way to get their cheesesteaks any time I am in Phoenix. Soooooo good. I've been coming here for about 15 years. Same great cheesesteaks every time. Same great people running it. Really nice people.,5
6938,Delicious chicken teriyaki bowl. The rice is perfectly cooked. The chicken is tender and moist. The teriyaki sauce is deliciously mild sweet. We come here on weekdays after spin class and we feel good after eating here.,5
6941,"Beautiful resort. Would definitely stay again. Price was excellent for all that the resort had to offer. If I had a family with kids and wanted to go to Las Vegas, this is the place to go. Vegas isn't exactly a kid place. This resort had a lake with boats, paddle boards. Pools. Bicycles, Golfing. Spa. It's close to other scenic attractions (Hoover Dam, Lake Mead, Grand Canyon). Would go back again if in town. Food was great.",5
6944,"Very clean, flavorful food! The staff is very friendly and helpful. We had a rotisserie chicken salad, and steak tacos that were really good. It's especially great because you can build all your own salads, bowls, and tacos. We will be back often:)!",5
6945,Loved my hair! I go here for organic highlights and an amazing cut every time with Leona. The energy is great here and everyone is so lovely!,5
6947,"When I first moved to Gilbert, I was lucky enough to find a rental house adjacent to the park. It was the perfect environment for our little family- me, a 3 yr old and a beautiful old Boxer. Safe, clean, and full of wide open spaces and shiny new playgrounds for imagination and fun.

Six years later, I've purchased a beautiful home next to the park. It's still very safe and clean, and now we're using the batting cages, the basketball courts and the skate park for healthy entertainment and family time. 

I don't think it's possible to outgrow the dozens of activities available at Freestone, and I can't imagine living anywhere else!",5
6949,"Best steakhouse I've ever been to. Food was top-notch, service was fantastic, AND they gave us complimentary corkage. I still dream about how good the steak was at this place! Highly recommend!",5
6950,"Single handedly the worst experience I have had at a pizza place, hope you don't get the blonde server her attitude is horrible. Food is good but not good enough to deal with that we will stick to Luciano's better food and much better service.

Forgot to mention I watched a 10 top walk out because of the attitude they were given for coming in at 9:20pm.
Sorry to the owner on losing sales like that.",1
6952,"I had to get a storage and needed to find one close to where my location and found Desert Storage first with good reviews and didn't look further.   I reserved one online which was super easy, didn't even need to pay for it in advance.   Went today to pay for it and confirmed and the process was PAINLESS!   Jae was very professional, helpful and just lovely to talk to!
People if you need storage please go there, it's convenient and CLEAN!",5
6955,I went here to ship packages to Oregon and LA. Derek was there to help me out. He's very helpful and I am satisfied with the service.,5
6956,"We stopped in to give them a try, glad we did. Quite possibly the best burger I have ever had. Stop in and ruin yourself for other burgers.",5
6957,I came here with my secretary on our usual Friday culinary adventure.  We were joking about the Italian (she is Italian) Japanese mix as we entered.  When we left we were speechless.  The food was wonderful and our experience was great.  We shared the calamari appetizer which was wonderful.  This is definitely on our list of returns.,5
6958,"This is baby number 4 for me, but the second one that Lisa has helped me with.  We just recently moved to Northern Idaho.  I thought I had this no problem.  Lisa taught me what to do with number 3.  Nope, every baby is different.  I found myself with a declining milk supply and sore nipples.  Called lisa freaking out. She got on the phone and on the internet. She was my hugest advocate and support.  She helped me arrange for a hospital grade breast pump and got me started on Golacta.  Baby will be 6 weeks old tomorrow. Finally getting comfortable with our breastfeeding.  Would have been a failure statistic without Lisa's help.  She is a light in the dark places of sleep deprivation, sore nipples, and wondering whether this is worth it.  We won't be doing this again.  I can however tell you that there is no greater cheerleader or coach in this business.",5
6959,Very fine service center.  Had my '15 Equinox serviced and they were fast and efficient. The young lady working the desk is very welcoming and professional. Would not hesitate to return.,5
6960,This is such an amazing spot I've probably been here 5 times. The food had always been good every time and the staff is just so nice and friendly it's definitely a spot you don't wanna miss. The restaurant is so uniquely built and fun the price is not bad either.,5
6963,"We went to Carvahlo's for restaurant week, and it was well worth the drive from Tempe. This restaurant has not been open long, but the food and the experience were the best we had this week. They still have some kinks to work out in the mechanics, but the food was excellent and generous in portion, and the personal touch added by the owner made the experience complete. Stories of growing up in the Amazon with a pilot father flying in missionaries and a personal tour of the various artifacts in the restaurant added to the dining experience, making it among the best I've had. He even sent us off with a DVD of his fishing exploits after I conveyed my own upbringing in a prominent fishing community. Despite the distance, we will be returning here soon, and I hope word gets out about this exemplary establishment. They deserve your business, and you won't be disappointed.",5
6964,"I ended up staying here for 3 nights this month.  I was very impressed.  There is free high speed internet included, and it was COX, a full 6-9mpbs! 

Best of all, they have a print server that you can use to print stuff out - for free.  24hours.

The beds were very comfortable, is was on par with a 5 star Mariott  stayed in before. The bed was better than Excalibur, and Tropicana.


There is a digital thermostat, and the A/C worked nicely. 

The rooms were pretty basic, but everything was clean.

The staff was friendly. 

The place was pretty dead for the most part. I got a great deal on Priceline.

While other hotels charge 12.99/day for internet.. this makes this place an even better deal.

It's not really too far from the strip.  Sunset road is almost like a freeway once you pass eastern, with only a couple more lights in between.  If you have a car, this is a good idea.",5
6968,This is a great mom and son shop. The staff were incredibly friendly and we able to describe each donut with precision. The donuts themselves were light and airy. The few I did select had just enough sweetness to savor and was not over powering. I am a sucker for old fashioned and Bavarian cream. The donut holes were out of this world. They were the lightest donut holes I have ever had and it was amazing! Will definently return for those.,5
6970,I eat breakfast here every time I am in town. I love the baked pancakes. I have never found them anywhere else and they are delicious. They take awhile to prepare but they are worth the wait and you know they are always fresh.,5
6971,"Hands down the best local coffee shop.  The staff is knowledgeable, helpful and FRIENDLY.  Maybe my favorite caramel iced coffee.  Also, I think they recently remodeled and revamped.  Loving the new vibe!",5
6972,Just got back to he office after tearing lunch here today.  Already not feeling well.  I had the ultimate ko dip with slaw and it was not good.  Iced tea was old.,1
6974,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  I have been here twice when traveling by myself for dinner and they are always welcoming and accommodating.  They really have never made a big deal about if I want a table or the bar and leave it up to me to chose.  Their bread service is the best part of the meal.  They serve warm, crusty baked french bread with a white bean, herb, and olive oil dip.  It is similar to hummus but WAY better. 

  The first time at Aria, I had a seasonal scallop and gnocchi dish which I was sad that they had taken off of the menu this past time but it is great that they change their menu seasonal.  This past visit, I stuck with a classic - chicken parmigiana.  The chicken was lightly pan friend and had fresh mozzarella on top.  It is served with pasta, sauce, and spinach.  I loved the addition of spinach into this dish.  It was a huge meal, two large pieces of chicken and I could only eat one.  It would be great to split or great leftover if you aren't traveling.",5
6975,This place is really nice. The food was delicious and the customer service is awesome!!! First time we are here and we loved it. The fish is super fresh and not fishy. Great experience.,5

6988,"This is the update for Diamond China.
The reason is that this establishment has lots its taste and style of cooking the reasons we have been goong for years.
One they renovated then they have new workers and or new management.
This was one of two restaurants I could get cake noodle like I can get from Hawaii.
Last night was the last straw. 
We alway order the same two dish everytime we eat there.
Minute chicken cake noodle and shrimp with snow peas.
How is this the last straw you ask.
Shrimp with snow peas had no taste at all.
Sloppy, less shrimp and no straw mushrooms. 
Minuate chicken cake noodle has no gravy and noodles was too wet non the inside and some of the outside edges was burnt.
Then to top ot off the waitress had a bad attitude when I asked did you get a new cook. No! Well where os the gravy on tje noodles.
My Hawaii Friends. Stay Away and don't waste your time and money. Go to the other local favorite.",1
6995,"HORRIBLE SERVICE! If I really got into what happened here I would be writing for hours, pretty much they were understaffed so the manager brought free chips and salsa to everyone, I asked for no onions on my tacos, it took 30 min to get new tacos, might I mention I got the wrong tacos when they brought them. My friends food was cold, oh and they comped my food cause they felt bad.... It was ridiculous  never going back",1
6996,"Lots of bad reviews on here... Thought I'd post my experience.

I drive a classic truck, do all the work myself.  I had an axle seal fail ruining my rear brakes.  I took the opportunity to replace everything on the rear myself which should have been no problem.  Well... weeks later after extensive troubleshooting I still couldn't stop the rear brakes from locking up. I spent a pretty penny on parts trying to fix this on my own and finally gave up.  I took it into one shop that misdiagnosed a proportioning valve issue then ""couldn't find"" a replacement part then made me drive it home to make space in their driveway for a car show.  I chose another shop that took the wheel off and said ""it all looks good to me"" and sent me packing.

I stopped in to Just Brakes and described the problem to Gene and the guys.  They were confident they could fix it but after having it on the rack for awhile Gene could tell this wasn't an easy problem.  I left it with them and Gene spent many hours troubleshooting and diagnosing a very difficult problem that I likely would have never found myself.  The fixed the truck and now it is running sweet!  Given the number of troubleshooting hours they had to put in I was worried about the cost but they gave me a damned reasonable bill, basically charging me for a few parts and a minimal amount of labor. 

Thanks for getting my truck back on the road guys, much appreciated.",5
6997,"I honestly wanted to love this place however the only good thing about this restaurant was the charming ambiance. We should have been tipped off by the restaurant being completely empty on a Saturday night! The food was horrendous. Possibly the worst restaurant meal I have ever had. The salad dressing was literally olive oil and salt....a lot of salt. The grilled peaches tasted like meat as they had clearly been cooked on the same grill. The pasta sauce was terrible. Very bland except for the overwhelming flavour of onions. Given some of the good reviews on here, I sincerely hope they were just having a bad night but I won't be back.",1
7000,"If I had only one day in Vegas, I would make sure that this is one of my stops.  The most visually pleasing malls I've ever been too.  Unlike any of the other casino malls, this one has no shops that you can afford.  It's all high end.  But I come for the wow factor, the canals of Venice, Disney clean, and the Italian Square will just blow you away. You will get an actual canal with gondoliers and Italian singers.  You get the feel you are outdoors but in a nice air conditioned comfortable indoor mall.  The town square is cool with many street type performers.  You may not shop, but you will regret not coming here for that reason.  From the artwork to the architecture, this really is a can't miss place.  Put it on your must do list.",5
7002,"I would totally recommend this cute caf√©! Right when we walked in we were greeted with smiles. The employees were super helpful and the overall service was great! There is a good variety of chocolates and baked goods, as well as drinks. I would recommend this to all my family and friends, and I will definitely be coming back!",5

I've been getting lashes done professionally for a few years and when my original lash artist moved out of state, I heard Timea was the ONLY person to see to get your lashes hooked up and done to the caliber I'm accustomed to. Soooo, a year later, glamorous and beautiful lashes still, Timea is my ONLY GO-TO lash gal. 

I LOVE her studio, it's upscale. 
The lash chair is THEE most comfortable one I've ever laid/sat in before. 
She knows her stuff and I'm so blessed she's in my life.",5
7010,"Top notch customer service! 

I am a Hilton Honors member so I try to take advantage of the rewards program whenever I travel. I paid for a nonrefundable reservation and ended up having to change it to a different day. I was not able to change my reservation with Hilton Honors customer service so I called the hotel instead. The hotel manager chuck was very accommodating and made the change for me right away without asking any questions! 

Then my car broke down on I-10 in the middle of nowhere in Benson AZ on a Saturday. I had to tow my car to Tucson to get it fixed. Under such a stressful circumstance, I didn't even know if I could make it to Phoenix on the same day or not. So I called the hotel again to inform them that I might not be able to stay that night. Seth was the one who picked up the phone. He told me I could call back anytime to cancel my reservation. He even called me later to touch base with me to see if my car was fixed. 

Finally I made it to the hotel around 10pm. Seth was there to greet me, ""Ms. W, I spoke with you on the phone. I'm so glad you've made it!"" Suddenly I felt right at home. My hotel stay was short but wonderful. My room was clean and the breakfast was delicious. When I requested a late check out at 1pm, Seth gladly accommodated my request without a charge. 

The customer is indeed God at this Hampton Inn. From several days prior to my arrival to the day I depart, this hotel was there every step of the way to provide me the best customer service possible. They went above and beyond to ensure I have a wonderful stay which I certainly did. I'd like to thank Seth and Chuck. 5 star all the way!",5
7011,"I love this place. Every sandwich I've had has been delicious and the ownership seriously cares about making a good sandwich. My immediate thought was how do I get work pay for catering at this place. 

Go there, spend under ten bucks get a whole meal and stop bitching about stuff and enjoy a good sandwich.",5
7014,"So pissed! After replacing all 4 tires at Walter or fail my PA state inspection, I only get to use them for 20k miles.  Thanks alot! Now, I have to replace them again! WTF!  For the price charged on those tires... it should have paid for some human honesty to tell me how crappy the tires that were going to be installed. 

After more research on the tire brand used, it seems like he just drove my car to PepBoys and used their generic brand, and charged me a shit load of money.  I am so upset every time I think about my damn tire experience.

If this place tells you, new tires are needed to pass state inspection, just go get them replaced elsewhere, and go back to show them the new tires to pass.  Nobody can afford 4 tires replacement every 20k miles. At least, I definitely can't afford to pay in this manner.",1
7016,"Phoenix coffee culture keeps growing.  This is good, and the pond is deep enough for everyone.  My Americano was perfect.  The shop is very clean and the staff very friendly.",5
7017,"I had never been there before until today. I always run in the post office and the line for this place snakes through the parking lot. Today my pregnancy craving got the best of me and I decided to check it out. 

I was greeted by a very upbeat and super sweet young man (I wish I had gotten his name) he first and formost made a great first impression!! He walked me through the menu, and I ordered what I would have at starbucks. 

The girls at the window were just as sweet and all had smiles... this wasnt your average coffee stop. I actually felt like smiling when I left. I was given a punch card and since it was my first time the young lady at the window gave me a few extra punches as well. 

The coffee is awesome. The line moves 5 times faster than any coffee place I have ever been to, and the service was unbeatable!! I for sure will be back!",5

7021,"I got a great deal on Groupon for $25 2 ppl for 1 hour of archery. Upon arrival, check in was extremely easy. The instructor had us watch a tutorial on safety and how to shot an arrow then we went to a room in the back where he already had our targets, bow, and arrows set up. He did a quick lesson with us and explained the safety procedures once more and then let us shoot on our own. While we practiced, there were a few locals who were really nice and gave us some tips, we were amazed at there super advanced bows and the distance they shot. Also, the instructor was so nice, he let us shoot for over a hour, after 80 mins, my friend and I decided to call it quits. I would definitely recommend this place, I felt total badass like I was shooting walkers on the walking dead.",5
7024,"If there was one type of food that would best represent the United States of America I would vote for BBQ. Whether you're a KC, Texas, NC, or Memphis BBQ fan, The Smoke Pit is definitely a contender. While I'm not the biggest fan of NC style BBQ The Smoke Pit showcases the different elements of BBQ in it's entirety. 

I saw all the rave reviews on Yelp so I decided to take a trip with my family. When we arrived the parking lot was full and there was a line almost to the door. As we inched our way up the line we eventually saw the sign that listed what items were already sold out for the day. As a result, I ordered the three meat BBQ combos which consisted of chicken quarters, Texas brisket, and St. Louis style ribs while my two sides were the mac & cheese and pork baked beans. 

The dining area is a large open room with various tables strewed about. After waiting about 10-15 mins our food was delivered on cafeteria style trays on top of red butcher paper. Personally, I love it when my BBQ is served on butcher paper because it reminds me of the good ole Lone Star. All of the food was awesome because it correctly reflected the different regions of American BBQ. My only slight gripe was the white sauce on the chicken quarters. While the white sauce did compliment the chicken, there was a bit too much of it which kind of detracted from the natural taste of the chicken.

All in all, The Smoke Pit is a MUST if you're ever down in the Charlotte/Concord area. Simplistic to it's core, The Smoke Pit proves that the delictable art of barbeque is alive and well at 796 Pkwy N.",5
7026,"Jim is an incredible human. We phoned several companies throughout town that would not even offer us a quote unless we would reconsider a FULL REPLACEMENT.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND Jim for his knowledge, his communication, and work were great!",5
7027,"John is an extremely hard worker!!! He deserves a solid 5 stars. He is very easy to schedule with, and his price is very reasonable. We moved several times while we lived in Arizona, and we always used his service, no one else. Now we live outside of Arizona and miss him so much.",5
7028,"I've made an account just to make this review.
First let start with the basics. Hospitality, manners and smile. All of the women working in this place are clearly unhappy with what they are doing. No smiles, no courteous words... I felt that they were doing me a big favor in taking my order.
Second the pastry. What joke is this ?! Have you ever been to the real Paris and tried any of their pastries ? I mean, I've been to Paris more than once and *any* pastry that I've tried was exponentially better than what I got from Madeleine. The latte ? What a joke... It was those machines that you normally have in your office when you want something really cheap and fast.
Very important... French pastry is not only about sweets but about meat, cheese, vegetables, etc, pastries... This place had 0 options. It was either sweet or sweet.
To finalize comparing this place with any of the European Pastries should be a crime. The floor of this place was dirt, the presentation was mediocre and the staff was unfriendly and unpleasant.

Quick note to the owner. Fire all your staff and hire people that care about your business and are happy with what they are doing.",1
7030,"Tip:hours aren't acurate , CALL first.Wasted trip to this place for 11a.m. other day.In the multi booth store, an Oyster neighbor said he's in 12pm.

Food ranged from watermelon with balsamic reduction and mascarpone cheese to little baskets of fried chicken. Also, a full breakfast buffet, omelette station, wide variety of cheese and salami, Asian food station and a delicious dessert table, complete with gelato! We highly recommend...don't miss.",5

7037,"Just had my very first bacon cheeseburger and fry from Five Guys, and it was amazing! They have two sizes of burgers, regular and little. This just means the regular has two patties and the little is just one patty. I ordered the little bacon cheeseburger and little fry, but there was nothing little about it. Plenty of fries come in the little order and they are the best fries I've ever had! You can top your burger any way you want from a list of free options. The bacon was crunchy and the flavor stood out on my burger, like it should. The manager was very friendly and explained a lot about the place when I told him I've never tried Five Guys before. The environment inside was very clean and organized. There was music playing over the speakers, which was enjoyable and set at the perfect volume. I will definitely be returning to this location when I want real fries with the potato skin on them and a great tasting burger.",5
7038,Great nail salon!! Jimmy is amazing !! Always does the best work. Not expensive at all. All the staff is very friendly. Would definitely refer anyone there!,5
7039,Just had a wonderful time and fabulous dinner celebrating my niece's birthday. Joshua was our waiter and was marvelous. Thank you,5
7041,"Don't judge a book by its cover. Seriously don't let the ambiance fool you. There are mariachi bands, a Mexican market in the courtyard, and a Ranch Market next door but that doesn't mean anything when you are served the ""authentic"" food here. I see Tradiciones rated high on several lists out there and they lose credibility with me every time. We couldn't even finish our margaritas they were so gross. The food was bland. The rice was awful as were the beans. If you cant make margaritas, cook rice and beans you have no business owning a Mexican restaurant. It doesn't belong anywhere near the top 10 Mexican restaurants. Here are a few that are much better: Pedros, Carolinas, Barrio Cafe, Los Dos Molinos, Richardsons, El Comedor, Taco Bell, Salsitas, Del Taco, Filibertos....well maybe not those last 4 but the rest are. Don't believe the hype. This place is a glorified tourist trap.",1
7042,"The food and the atmosphere at Cabo's are what keep us going back!  My family and I have moved around the country a lot and it is always nice to find a restaraunt at your new home that makes an old favorite, for us Cabo's does exactly that with their enchilladas suiza!  Fantastic dish my wife and baby girl seldom order anything else.  Cabo's also offers a Sunday Brunch that is a winner as well, a fair price for an excellent selection of breakfast and lunchtime favorites.  I am sure that you will agree that Cabo's is an outstanding place to have a pleasant meal with that southwest flare!",5
7043,"Real southern style soul food that is reasonably priced. The kool aid is sweet, and the staff have the right attitude.",5
7045,"ANGRY DRAGON SUSHI -- if you come here, do yourself a favor and order this! OH MY GOD, IT'S THE BEST THING EVER. I had it about a week ago and ever since then I have been craving it EVERY SINGLE DAY. This roll is one the best rolls I've ever had. It's full of flavor, slightly spicy but just right. We ordered a couple other rolls (don't remember names) and those were good but once you try the Angry Dragon, you really don't even want to eat anything else, nothing else compares!

They were very busy for Hibachi, but dining service was still prompt. Our waitress was very sweet and checked with us often. The atmosphere is nice and relaxing, I enjoy coming here.

Overall, a great experience, and the ANGRY DRAGON, don't forget! :)",5
7046,"Absolutely wonderful food, service was amazing (Thank you Hector!!!) we had sooo much fun. This restaurant came highly recommended and now we know why! We will be back.",5
7047,"And we are not the only ones who now hold Dr. Cynthia Kiernan in high esteem--after having read all the reviews on this page.  Best eye exam ever and you want to know what is going on with your eyes, your prescription, anything at all?, Dr. Kiernan takes the time to explain in detail.  Never have I been so well informed!  This is crazy but I always hate that part ""Which is better...lens number 1 or 2?""  I put so much pressure on myself to hopefully give the right answer but Cynthia Kiernan takes the time to make sure that one might be better than the other!   The staff members are absolutely wonderful and we can't be any happier that we decided to see Dr. Kiernan for our exams.  Sorry we hadn't found her sooner but she has us for life now!",5
7050,"Horrible. I was ripped off. The lady argued that I had to pay twice the charge of what I was actually quoted. If you want welfare nails, go here. I will never visit this place again.",1
7051,Karsen's is a great laid back bar. Everyone (staff and patrons) is very friendly so it has the neighborhood pub vibe. Attention Scottsdale DBs...please do not come here. You will not like it and the regulars don't care.,5
7052,"You may be thinking: why would I order a burger at a place like this? Well, the wait staff may not let you turn it down and you'll find it's one of the tastiest burgers ever crafted. I also ordered the red onion pakoras and cherry blossom dessert. All were fantastic!",5
7053,"Very nice staff, but there's so many hidden charges. We went on for one thing and they always made us do additional blood work. We took the money to pay for that visit and then had to pay extra for blood samples here and there. We didn't have insurance, so the prenatal care for us was going to be $355 a month plus extra for ultrasounds and additional lab work. We spoke with the manager to explain to us the contract, and we said we have to think about it. She said that if we take too long we would have to pay extra for another contract. Compassionate Care, where's the compassion? 
Anyways, we went to another clinic that did accept Sunny Babies and the prenatal care was $150 a month all included. The new doctor told us that some of the blood work done at Compassionate Care wasn't necessary. For example the toxicology test was unnecessary. We told him what they were charging and he laughed lol. 
At first I was very happy and Compassionate Care because the staff was very nice and helpful. Especially the nurse Maria. She was great! I lost interest in this place once they started with their hidden fees. Another good thing about this place is they attend you right away. 
My final tip, if you don't have insurance and you do decide to go here, make sure you ask them exactly how much you have to pay. 
I hope you have a healthy pregnancy and God bless your little one. Thanks for your time.",1

7057,"Fantastic ... went to another store in this mall with the intent of a gift, left and came here.  Glad I found their Olive Oil soaps!!!

Went online to find one of their stores closer to me.   I adore olive oil and found some soap that I purchased for gifts.  Reasonably priced for this great soap.  Will come again ~

Also have lots of interesting wines on display.  Didn't need it this trip but will look at them again for wine  ~",5

7060,"We needed a cab to get back to our hotel from a bar.  Called Yellow Cab at 1:10 a.m., and they refused to give an ETA.  In retrospect, that should have been a huge red flag.  Long story short, several phone calls later we got a cab at 3:00 a.m.  In a word: unacceptable.",1

7064,"My Mom passed on 07/03/2017. I want to ""Thank"" Sage for the care that she received from them. They were very respective. A CNA and a Nurse came while I was there. I forgot the Nurse's name I   Remember she had the Christian Fish on her necklace or somewhere. Mom would have loved that! Ya know because of another past appt , I was apprehensive of the Company. My ""BIG"" mistake. They came thru 100%. They did what they could do for my Mom. I am so grateful for their care and understanding. So would I suggest ""Sage"" for Hospice & Palitive care ? Well anybody who is looking for care should use ""Sage"" .......Again to the folk's @ ""Sage"" Thank-You so much!!!!!!! Does this make any sense? Hope so....",5

7070,"Called ICE on the Saturday night of the EDC Festival with a broken air conditioner.  ICE not only answered the phone, but sent Chris out to fix my air machine. I told Chris I had  been working her pretty hard and  suspected it would be electrical. Chris checked it out, told me the specific problem and noticed another, fixed them all in a very reasonable time and considering it was a Saturday Night, at a very good price. It's nice to see a business ""in the trades"" that recognize the 24 town this is and provide a night work shift. So if you need help after everyone else has gone home. Call ICE!",5
7071,"Another 5 star little spot in Pittsburgh. My brother found this place on yelp when they came to visit me and we went before the remodel. It was a tiny place, only seating was outside but it was well worth the cramped quarters. I got the lomo (filet) sandwich and added some chimichuri sauce for a delish finish. The sandwich itself was a ton of meat, cooked to perfection and the chimichuri was a nice spicy/fresh finish. A+ on the sandwich. Loved the ambiance of the small place too, menu written on the chalkboard, loud cooks and a friendly guy taking my order. 
I recently went back and found that they were remodeling. I didn't know and was disappointed that I didn't get to fulfill my Argentinian steakhouse sandwich needs for that day. BUT I went back and LOVE LOVE LOVE what they did with the place. They moved right next door into the vacant building that was next to them. I think it may have been another restaurant at some point. The decorations are adorable, very Latin American/retro. They have expanded their menu to include salads, appetizers, veggies and other items, including breakfast. 
There was already a line at 11 on Sunday when they were getting ready to open. We were first in line and I couldn't help myself and had to get the Carne con Pan. So steak, bread, onions, red peppers and chimichurri. I had the filet again and my partner had the ribeye. Both were delish and spot on. I also ordered some grilled corn, which was also spot on. 
Can't say enough good things about this place. Will continue to frequent and hope their business thrives, they deserve it!",5
7072,"I dropped off my sons power wheels truck here before Halloween it's now a week before Christmas.  During this time I was told that they could and would fix it and that they were waiting on their license to fix power wheels and it would just be a couple of weeks. After 2 and a half months and still hearing about how it would only be a couple of weeks before it was fixed,I just arranged to have my friend pick it up.  I wasn't going to leave a bad review as it is my understand in the company recently changed hands.  Until I got the truck back home.  They put the truck on their back porch area and left it to the elements.  It is covered in dirt, leaves and has clearly been rained on a lot.  This is just the beginning of the complaints that I am about to file in regards to the awful business practices that this shop engages in.  

Don't waste your time or money here, they don't keep you informed and you will have to stay on top of them if you ever want them to slowly get around to helping you, if they bother at all.  And in my case they just made my bad situation worse!",1
7073,Worst cappuccino ever. This place is not Italian. It is just branded with two Italian words. That does not mean you get it right.,1
7075,"I love when I can go to Pretty Pretty Please. Amanda is great and wonderful. I have gotten everything from make up tips to temporary tats. She even entertained my 4 year old little girl when I went in for an appt. I am definitely going to go as often as I can.

There was a little confusion when there was another group from our company and they only had one of us booked.",5

Thanks Soho!",5
7084,"Best meal I had in Vegas. 

 It was a chilly but sunny day when we were there, so was so happy to discover they have heated lamps by the tables outside so we could still sit there and enjoy the view of the Bellagio fountains! 

 As soon as we were seated they brought two loaves of warm, delicious fresh bread. I started with a house salad which had a delicious olive vinaigrette dressing, followed by the steak bordelaise which was one of the best steaks I've ever had for sure. My friend and I also split a carafe of their  frangia which I'd highly recommend (though careful with ordering a carafe, it's strong!).",5
7086,"Really great lunch menu. Portions were reasonable and even able to take some home. Our server (Kalee!) was nice, quick service, and made us feel comfortable. Packed up our to-go food and gave us bread and a to-go drink. Really good! Food was tasty. I got the Big Rig and it was tasty and not too spicy (I really like spice so try at your own risk). My partner got the Big Hot Parm sandwich and it was tasty as well. The only thing I want is for them to bring back the cream soda!",5
7087,"Gen from outside the entrance looks like a really quiet restaurant. Yet as soon as you emerge through the front doors the fun environment, the colors of the lighting and the beats from the music just fill you up with this awesome vibe that is Gen. The decor of Gen is very modern yet has slight classy aesthetics of the Korean culture sprinkled through the layout. It's actually very eye catching once you come through the entrance. For the style alone I give Gen 5/5 stars.

Let's get down to the main part of the review here. The food, the comfort,  and our help/service.

Gen is all you can eat...and the pricing is actually very reasonable. $20 per person isn't bad at all! Especially if you have 34 choices of meats and items + any of the appetizers + all of the sides. All of that for just for $20! My wife and tried as much as we could. We started with appetizers: gyoza(fried), edamame, japchae, pickled veggies, potato salad, and a salad.
-Only gripe was the edamame which was a little over cooked but didn't stop me from enjoying them. Everything else was delicious! Now the main part....MEAT! So many wonderful choices! 
We ordered: Beef bugolgi, garlic chicken,garlic calamari,steak strips,pork cutlet,cajun shrimp, roast beef, bugogli chicken, and I know more just can't remember it all. Everything was freaking delicious! The portions were not too much nor too little. The plethora of flavors kept my dance buds dancing all night. Gens good easy get 4/5 stars

All this yummy food was accompanied by the awesome booth seating we asked for. The booth was comfortable, soft and supportive. The tables had a nice feel to them, like a mixture of vinyl and marble. The table was large enough for our multiple plates, our drinks, the sides and our entrees; with plenty of elbow room to spare. Oh and I almost forgot the cooking pan sits dead center of the table! So all in all the comfort level was indeed a 5/5 stars!

Now onto the icing on the cake , the service. Adolina was our main service of help for the night and she was awesome!  Really attentive and friendly. She made recommendations that were awesome! She always had our glasses full and prompt when making sure our cooking pan was replaced immediately when it started to have all the excess burnt food sizzling on it. It's easy to express that Adolina was just pure awesome sauce; friendly, fun, informative, and an all around suburb waitress. We will be back for her service and friendly smile along side the food!  Adolina services alone help give Gen a 5/5 stars. 

So to sum it up for you yelp readers, Gen is fun, has great food, energetic atmosphere and has amazing service. Let Gen be your next Kbbq experience!",5
7088,"Wow, what can I say.  We went here on a whim for lunch one day with a group from work and what a pleasant surprise!  The service and the food were all amazing!  The buttermilk fried chicken salad and barbacoa were out of this world.  Today we went again to try the breakfast.  Oh my, it may have been even better than lunch!  The Tres Locos with eggs over medium were out of this world.  The perfect blend of flavors.  I immediately asked for hot sauce at which Eric told me I did not need it to enjoy the perfect blend of flavors.  Was he right!  This was by FAR the best breakfast I have had in ages.  My friend ordered the Crazy Biscuits and loved every bite.  Eric then talked us into a lemon pancake for dessert.  I do not eat pancakes, I find them to be too heavy.  Oh my, this was the most AMAZING pancake I've ever tasted in my life.  I will be dreaming about that lemon fluffy goodness for a while!  Do yourself a favor, try this place.  Let Eric help you with what to order.  You will not be let down!",5
7089,"This place is the perfect stop for a delicious brunch, any place with bacon in the name is bound to have high expectations and The Oink Cafe did not disappoint! My fianc√©e and I enjoyed the breakfast chimi and not only was this thing massive, it was to die for!! Perfectly crisp on the outside, as any chimichanga should be, and on the inside the most tender and crispy pork confit (that's fancy for carnitas), and if that is not enough to seduce any palate the whole thing was smothered in a sinfully rich chorizo cheese sauce... heaven!! The service was great, and the manager and his wife were the perfect hosts! We would move to Arizona just to be closer to this cafe! Until next time Oink Cafe, you will be in our food dreams!

7091,Amazing food with a great service. I would definitely recommend this place if you like kabobs and some Indian curry style food.,5
7092,"These guys don't even deserve 1 star. They never fixed my issue!  My warranty company, BPG, sent these guys to address a water softener issue. I had to call them to get it set up. It took them 3.5 business (plus a weekend also so it was almost a week) to even be able to come to diagnose the issue. They called to show up 2 hours early (luckily I was available and I was happy he was early - the only positive thing in this whole situation). He spent about 5 minutes diagnosing, said he'd need to get approval, order the part, and then come back out. I paid him a $60 deductible. I got a call 2 days later that they received the part and wanted to schedule install. I asked to confirm it was covered by warranty and the lady told me ""Well, I don't see anything listed so I assume so"". Since I had read other reviews on Yelp about their questionable honesty, that wasn't good enough. I told her I wouldn't let them install until I had confirmation it was covered. She said ""Ok, I'll have to call you back because I didn't see those notes"". 

That was the last I have heard from them. It's almost been an entire week. I've called them several times and have gotten no response. I even got my warranty company involved and even they have not been able to get ahold of them or get a call back from them. My Warranty company has since scheduled for a new plumber to come out.  And it's now been over a week since I first reported my issue and I'm back at the beginning...

AND THEY JUST DEPOSITED MY CHECK AND THEY HAVE NOT REPAIRED THE ISSUE OR CALLED ME BACK.  THEY ARE CROOKS!!!!!!!!!

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!  If your warranty company has scheduled for them to come, request that they send someone new.",1
7094,"Lordy, where do I begin?? I have been enjoying Nancy's cookies for over a decade now so it's just amazing to me that I have never been!!

Meh fianc√© and I decided to stop on a cold day last week. We thought this cookie would go well with our coffee. Well did we end up with a treat!! The nice gentlemen working brought fresh out of the oven chocolate chip cookies. They were out of this world!!!!!!

We also sampled the chocolate covered chocolate chip cookie, very good! The buckeye and sugar cookie were very good, just not made the way I prefer. 

I can't wait to go back and buy more of these  cookies fresh out of the oven and see the friendly workers!!",5
7095,"I was extremely disappointed when I arrived at the garage today. I went to order the Prickly Pear BBQ tacos that I am in love with...only to find out that they don't have them anymore.  My server, Bobby, went up and above the call of duty to get the kitchen to make them for me. I will definitely be back because of him! He's also super hot, so that's a plus!!",5
7098,I love this place. It's a great atmosphere. It's family owned and the prices are great! The food is delicious it feels kinda like home when I come in there.,5
7099,"I really don't know what to say about IKEA it is just that amazing. I would not go to IKEA during the weekend cause it is so crowded in the isles especially when you have a shopping cart. My whole house is filled with IKEA things. Cabinets, countertops, flooring kitchen ware and utensils, office furniture, loft furniture, bedroom and bathroom, etc. Don't even get me started with the IKEA cafe. Their Sweden and American food combined makes it a food lovers paradise. IKEA is like being in a candy store for your house and you never want to leave without buying everything. I love the store and everything they do there. The best home decor store in America.",5

7101,"So we called a cab, after 30 mins they said they arrived. We found the green cab and after talking to the cab driver he said he had to talk to dispatch and he drove away. Worst part was that I sat on the curb while waiting, no big deal... But I actually sat in someone's puke. Well the green cab driver bailed and green cab said they would put us back on the waiting list for a ride... Ummm hello we should be the next available ride.. But no we had to take an uber which was 2 times the rate. Anyways, probably won't ever take green cab again.",1
7102,"I have to admit I don't write as many of these as I should. We stopped but the store wasn't open yet. Anxiously waiting and eager to try the Strawberry french toast and Apple waffles. The coffee was excellent and food off the hook! The prices were as expected for Las Vegas. The thing that made this first time experience was our server Justin! Justin's attention to detail was beyond my expectation. We eat out A LOT and there are VERY FEW servers that exceed my expectations. Justin may be only one of a handful of people I've sought out the manager to tell them about how wonderful they were. ""Examples: Justin brought us new silverware because he didn't like that they ones we had weren't polished. He brought me extra strawberries when I questioned if I got the mixed berry or strawberry french toast. (They only have a strawberry version that has a mix of raspberries, black berries and strawberries.)"" I can't give enough stars to how much this experience has raised the bar even more for the rest of the serves I encounter!",5
7103,"I never giving one star review but honestly I feel like it was the worst chinese food might have ever had in my life. Worst part was I really wanted too give this place a chance since so close too my house like five mins. So with open mind knowing that most of the reviews negative ones. I see for myself. Not worth it. The only thing positive the lady was very nice asking her questions and helping me figure out what should try since it was my first time. Her noodle recommendation telling me most popular baffles me. It had no flavor and mean NO flavor or distinct flavor of anything! I understand certain noodles get gravy type of sauce depending on the noodle. It was so dry that felt like needed water too get it down. Other thing order (sorry all take out) general tao chicken. She was telling me spicy but nothing spicy about it. Again NO flavor just tasted so bland need too put shoyu or something on top give it something. Both of it was BAD Chinese food.

The worst part is had half of the noodles when notice a piece of steel (from scrub pad use too clean the wok or kitchen equipment) in it. So on top of everything being bland tasteless get piece of steel in my noodles. This place is flat out Horrendous!  I never be coming back here again.",1
7104,The food & atmosphere is amazing. It's a must try if you want some authentic Mexican food,5
7105,"Pattie's is a proper dive. 

Tons of space, open air center area, and plenty of fellow degenerates to socialize with.  
Best feature is that they allow smoking ""inside"", so you're able to enjoy a smoke whilst, you enjoy your drink. 

Decent selection of your usual basic dive bar beers & liquors, which is all you need to get to you last call with a good group of friends.  Prices are nice & cheap, bartenders are quick & attentive. Can't wait to go back & earn another hangover.",5
7106,"I live in Oregon and visit Vegas several times a year. I have visited this establishment the last 3 times I have flown out to in Vegas. Jackie is amazing. I agree to an hour, but I found myself getting another hour because I felt so relaxed. I'll always come to this place when I'm in town.",5
7108,Just left this health center great experience. Everyone is so nice and they try there best to get you in and out quickly!!! Make it easy for first time clients. I will definitely be coming back if I need anything else done or checked,5
7111,"This is one of my favorite places to stop on my way home. I've tried their tacos and burritos, both were very good. Each time I've went in, they've been very friendly. The only complaint was my husband ordered nachos and the sauce was so hot, it was almost inedible. Might just be the way they make things, but he didn't ask for any salsa on them. Otherwise, all my experiences here have been wonderful.",5
7112,Sold a small gold necklace here. Only took a minute or two and was happy with the price offered. Looked around the store and they have some really cool silver bullion coins bars and so on. They even had constitutional silver in small bags. I'll be back!,5
7114,"We absolutely LOVE this deli. We've only ever gotten sandwiches from here. Excited to one day branch out, but whoa are the sandwiches good. The homemade bread is the way to go and of course, they give you homemade potato chips as well. I can pick almost any sandwich on the menu and be happy with it. Great quality, very fresh food. PS - I'm Italian and was raised with Italian breads, cold cuts and olives and this place is legit!",5
7115,"Terrible book, the people working there are cool but it is a bar and a pool table, no place to really sit and just watch and enjoy the game. Go to the sports book at cosmo or at aria they are WAY better than here.",1
7116,"As someone who knows the Middle East and especially Lebanon, I find the meals in this establishment to be as near as I can possible think to Beirut cooking and dining. The ingredients are fresh, healthy and plentiful. The bread baked there, and the dishes have the perfect delicate flavors you can only expect to get in the country. I go there to eat often since I sit and take myself back to Beirut and to the beautiful country. Please try the place, I personally recommend it, which is something that I would never do otherwise. The family run place, and the wonderful atmosphere always finds its way to your appetite through the wonderful intro to Zaatar as a taste introduction to the flavors. Dipping pita bread in the olive oil infused with Zaatar spices is indeed a heavenly experience. I know I am going overboard, but please do go try for your self and see what I mean. This is again form someone who lived and tried all of the meals served there. Again, with a family running the place, and a Lebanese Chef in the Kitchen who comes with Beirut experience, you can't go wrong. Eating there is like sitting on the Kornish in Beirut. Enjoy.",5
7117,"Really love the ambiance of this place... Drink selection is amazing, but not cheap. You are paying for the amazing ambiance too. :)",5
7118,"Super accommodating and helpful!! The people were great and the comradery on the road made the trip even more fun.

7119,"Jeremy and Michael are the event directors of JMT Eventology.  They planned my daughters wedding from  soup to nuts with nary a hitch!  The event flowed smoothly thanks to all their help.  They went out of their way to take me to see places and plan the event.  We had numerous phone and email exchanges.  We met with vendors together and they helped put together the perfect team. Both Jeremy and Michaels are very personable and made sure we got exactly the wedding we wanted.  They rose to all our challenges!!!  I am a New Yorker --its not easy to please me but JMT Eventology is the BEST in all of Las Vegas!!!  You get not one great planner, you get 2!!!  They are an amazing team.  I live 2300 miles away from Las Vegas.  They are as hands on as you can get.  They had the timing of the 5 hour event down to the minute.  We could have never done this without them.  Thank you Jeremy and Michael !!!",5

7122,"I've given this place too many chances and I officially am no longer a customer. They took away the ability to use your card online. You can order online but they only accept cash when they deliver, no checks. I never have cash and shouldn't have to scramble. This is 2017, not 1990! 

Last weekend I called at 8pm to place an order and was immediately put on hold. I waited, the background noise was ridiculous when talking to the order taker and if they are going to force people to call in who use debit or credit cards then at least have a decent quiet spot for people to answer the phone. I placed my order of 2 salads and a cheese pizza. The girl said it would be here within the hour. Okay fine, it's late so what's an hour...so we waited, and waited and waited. Finally at 930 I called and the driver answered the phone and told me he had been trying to call me but I wouldn't answer my phone and that the address I gave didn't exist. Okay...so he repeated back to me what the girl wrote down and she had my phone number and street name wrong...I shouldn't have to think to ask them to verify the address and number she wrote down because any other pizza delivery allows you to order and pay online, so if I make a mistake then that's on me! The manager got on the phone and said he'd make a new pizza and have it delivered...finally 2 hours and 15 minutes later our food came.

Here is where I feel horrible...I feel horrible for the employees who work for the irresponsible owner of this establishment because they take the brunt of people's frustration. I feel horrible because the poor kid who delivered my pizza got no tip because the manager said it was on the house (yes that was nice) but now there was no slip to sign and I had no cash to hand this kid. He said he didn't need the tip and I apologized profusely to him. I told him to please tell his management staff to send the message to allow folks to pay online. If the driver sees this, contact me please because I owe you a tip!!!

I'm not a fan of the pizza here in AZ because we had many great NY style pizza places in FL but I did like the taste of Geno's pizza and their salads are really good but it doesn't make up for the frustration!  I don't even have the energy to type everything that happened the time before but bless the driver (again) for having patience while he sat at my door for 10 minutes trying to help me pay with my card over the phone since they refuse checks. No more. Bye Geno's, I am breaking up with you for the last time. I don't like yoyo relationships. Please improve for the sake of your customers who keep your lights on.",1

They offer really great student discounts, making it affordable for us poor ASU students! Yoga Nirvana is my church and I always feel great after 90 minutes of class-- can't recommend it enough!",5

7134,"I played in a golf tournament here on Monday and shot my lowest round ever. Thus, this is my new favorite course. Beautiful views of the strip and challenging holes. Lots of elevation and fancy houses surrounding the fairways and greens.

If I lived in Vegas I would want to live here because security was insanely good. The gate guard was not messing around and took his job very seriously.",5
7135,"Wow. I totally went here because of the Yelp reviews. Best reviews! But I went there over the weekend and she said to come back in an hour. Typical because it's the weekend. I made an appt for Tuesday for a pedi & full set thinking it would be dead. The appt was for 12. 

I arrive a couple of minutes before noon. I waited for 22 minutes before they even sat me down for a pedicure. The guy was working on 2 pedicures at the same time. The woman was working on 1 pedicure. One of their regulars came in and the guy left his 2 pedicures to start on the regular's manicure. They never said it'll be 10 more minutes or anything. My feet soaked in an inch of cold water for 10 minutes. 

I finally asked for a towel to dry my feet and left!! Unbelievable! There are a million nail places here--try ANYWHERE else!!!! Oh and she tells me the appt is for 1230?!! unless you have all day to spend here, skip it!!",1
7136,"Exactly the kind of bike shop you dream of, and so rarely find.  Go and enjoy!

- Extremely nice, very friendly, and happy staff

- Very competitive prices (cheapest quote I got for a major service)

- Quick turnaround (quoted time was a quick turnaround, and they finished even earlier and called to tell me it was ready for pickup)

- Very capable mechanics (they do complicated services, like fork work, in-house)

- Honest and gracious (they taught me how to disassemble my full suspension bike for travel...as a free courtesy!  And they'd never met me before. A quick piece of work, but one that would have taken me ages on my own and might have resulted in damaging my bike)

- They like bikes and ride; happy to schmooze about trails, bikes, and life

- High end equipment shop (low-end shops often fail to do good work on high-end equipment, due to lack of care or unfamiliarity with it; high-end shops do great work on high end-equipment and that extends to low-end equipment)

Worth a drive across town.  The kind of place you patronize with a smile.  Great service, great price.  Highly recommended.  I've been patronizing bike shops for almost 20 years, and have only found one other shop in this league.",5
7138,"Aweful experience. The sales people stretch the truth, lie and advertise cars falsely. Be careful going in if you find one on the Internet. We went in with the VIN # and they showed us a car with more accessories on it than was on the same car on the internet and shrugged it off. 
Spent three hours there and the salesperson asked me my name over 5 times and wouldn't listen to what I wanted. 
Went to another dealership and got a better car, cheaper, more options and the guy asked me my name once.  
Over all I don't feel they listen to their customers and I'll never shop there again. 
Terrible experience!!!!!!",1
7141,It probably seems dumb to a lot of people because a gas station's a gas station but I just absolutely love this QT! I stop here quite often in the mornings during my work week & I love the staff! They are always so friendly & get the morning rush of people through quick without making you feel like an inconvenience to them. I will always stop at this gas station over any others solely because of the amazing staff! (Plus the QT kitchen has some pretty great food),5
7142,This has to be the cutest place ever! Fresh and savory food that's healthy and delicious. Comes in a cute little Bento Box that can be reused!

Initially Melissa and Kyle consulted with me on my vision. Melissa highlighted my hair to a beautiful blonde ( correcting my last disappointing color from another salon) then Kyle prooved himself to be a true stylist, not your run of the mill hair cutter! He truly wanted me to feel beautiful and he did! 

What a team they are and I truly thank them for their superior service!",5

7157,My husband and I were visiting AZ and found this cute little place. Everyone was very friendly and accommodating. Ask for Dang! Such a nice man and a perfectionist-which every girl loves.

7159,"I am so sorry to say that we had a terrible meal and service at the Pines Tavern last night.  We sat at the bar, and it's hard to imagine bad service at the bar but this server basically disappeared, and only after we asked for some attention from one of the other servers did this woman reappear.   The meal was described as perch over potatoes and warm Brussels sprout salad with a Swiss chard pesto.  This brownish green covered fish(not perch) appeared and sat over cold hard unseasoned fingerlings with black spots throughout and tasteless mushy Brussels sprouts.  The most disturbing thing was the color of the pesto, in no way did it look like food, it was truly gross.  Since our waitress never checked on us I just picked at it but it was not edible.  The Pines always has had an overly ambitious menu, they need to stick to basics and try to master simple fresh food.  It's so disappointing because it's a convenient location.",1

7173,Fantastic local sandwich shop. Bread is fresh and sandwiches are made to order and delicious. Cozy little interior and you can tell there is a local clientele that visit often which means it's great food.,5
7174,"I asked this shop to do a pre-purchase inspection on a truck I was considering purchasing. I live out of state, so could not inspect the truck myself.

7188,"I love the cozy feel of Roaring Fork, but what's even better than the atmosphere is their incredible happy hour menu. I think they have one of the best happy hours in town, especially when they start their all-night happy hour during the summer months! That's right, I said all night happy hour! Their happy hour menu includes their signatures items including the pork stew, fish tacos and the Big Ass burger...and yes friends, it's truly a Big Ass Burger! Keep an eye on their updates because a little birdie told me that the all night happy hour is coming to town very soon!",5
7190,"To be honest I used to live off the best menu item which was the juicy portabella mushroom burger, I would pick it up for lunch at least 3x per week, in addition to going there for dinner....a total addiction until they took it off the menu. That's ok, I needed a change. I love the Thai lettuce wraps with peanut dressing that's another serious addiction. The sweet Hawaiian salad tastes like candy. All of the salads are among the best salads you can get anywhere. The Chicken Marsala is fantastic. The simple four cheese pasta is crack. Oh the salmon rice dish with a light lemon sauce will fill you up yet you'll feel good. Those suggested pasta dishes are really good. Steak and ribs was ok, yet I order that at a stake house. Fish and chips yummy. Burgers are fantastic. The size of the burrito reminds you of your first born child. So again, I'll admit when I lived down the street at the Biltmore Estates I went here for dinner at least 4x per week at my sons request. But it's always nice and quiet, easy to have great conversations.  Consistent quality food, tons of variety to satisfy everyone's  tastes. Esp great when you don't feel like doing dishes. The appetizers are all very good as well.",5
7191,"I can't believe it's taken me so long to come here! Our 1st wedding anniversary was the perfect opportunity. 

I knew we were going to love it when the dipping olive oil and bread was outstanding! We started with the grilled eggplant, which was good, but as someone that doesn't LOVE eggplant, it probably wasn't the best choice. I think if you like it you'll love this dish.

Next up was their seafood pasta. Which was pretty much perfection. The sauce was one of the best I've ever had! It was a perfect balance of every flavors in it! The seafood blend was just right. 

I can't wait to go back!!",5

7198,"We ordered the lamb shawarma plates (for a mere $8.95 each) tonight for take-out after my brother recommended this place.  The man on the phone, who I am guessing was the owner, was so kind.  Good start.  The food was ready when my husband picked it up.  He also ordered a rice pudding to go, and the owner was worried that moving the pudding to a take-out dish would ruin the presentation, so he let my husband take the pudding in the glass dish it was in, asking us to bring it back some time.  This kind of friendly service is nearly extinct.  Our shawarma plates were delicious, with tender lamb, fresh salad, moist rice, and a surprise garnish of cucumber yogurt sauce.  Additionally, it came with a generous side of hummus and pita, which we were actually too full to eat until later.  The owner threw in two ice cold cans of pepsi as well, for no extra charge.  It is a bit of a drive for us, but I think we will make this a regular take-out treat because the food, service, and prices are simply outstanding.  
PS - I am from southeastern MI originally, and this quality and value made me feel like I was in Dearborn again, where this type of food has much competition and is always delicious and cheap.  This was the highlight of our weekend.",5
7199,"Delicious comfort food and the best customer service!!

The owners of this restaurant are some of the most genuine, humble, and sweetest people I've met in my life! They welcomed my husband and I the moment we arrived and we quickly had a great, wholesome conversation. It's hard to come by genuine people like this nowadays. We're new to the area and they truly made us feel like we were family.

My husband grew up in the Detroit suburbs and is a proud Michigander, so anything that represents or has some Detroit elements to it, makes him happy. I came across this restaurant, was surprised at the name, and knew we had to check it out.

Food - Great comfort food! Definitely true to Detroit flavors. My husband had the ribs and coney dog and loved it - he felt like he was back home.

Customer service - AMAZING! Like I mentioned, it's a family owned restaurant, led by a husband and wife team, and they're so sweet and friendly!!

Interior - Humble little fast food restaurant. What really matters is the food and customer service, and those two are on par!

Nothing like a sweet family owned restaurant!
There's a lot of heart in this business and we appreciate it so much. We loved our experience and will definitely be back!",5
7202,"For a place that specializes in seafood the food was terrible. We had the seafood platter for two and everything was over cooked. The mussels, lobster, crab, shrimp all over done and dry. The calamari was non-existent, we basically were given fried batter. We also ordered oysters and they were bland. When the oysters were initially brought to us no condiments were given only lemon. If you are that confident in your oyster quality why the heck do they suck? For the prices this place was charging you would expect better quality. I do not recommend this place if you are looking for good seafood.",1

7207,"The best sleeper place in Vegas! Aside from all of the positive things you read in these reviews, ALL of the money collected from the machines goes to charity (The Salvation Army)! The staff does not get paid! After being in their new building for less than 6 months, they wrote one big juicy check to the Salvation Army for $100000!  I can't get my boss to buy a box of GirlScout cookies. Amazing that a donation that big could be gotten from quarters!

7208,"Been here a number of times now and one word to describe Nori Sushi is: WONDERFUL :)

This is my new favorite Sushi place in Phoenix.  Stumbled upon it a few months ago and been back frequently.  The toro melts in your mouth, so good!  I've tried 3 or 4 of their specialty rolls and my absolute favorite is the Sakana Trio Roll.  It is mouth-watering and has soft citrus filled boba on top - so unique!  Could tell the fish was fresh and top quality from the first bite.  Quality has been superb every time.  Everything is good from the fish to the service to the cleanliness to the location to the patio and the desserts.  I don't drink sake but I saw they have a huge selection too! 

Thank you Nori for bringing yummy sushi to our neighborhood.  Always pleasant.",5
7209,"I kept seeing pictures of their waffle cones on Instagram and after going, Bang Bang definitely lived up to the hype! Definitely a 5/5 for the atmosphere of the store, quality of the dessert and service! The waffle is just like any regular waffle you can get anywhere HOWEVER, with the combination of their ice-cream, it was fantastic. The best part about eating the waffle cone is at the end when you're pretty much done with the ice-cream and wishing you had more but then realizing that the waffle has been soaking up the melting ice-cream.

Their London Fog ice-cream is probably one of the best ice-creams I've ever had. The Totaro (taro) was good too, but I've had good taro flavoured ice-cream at other places before. I hear their avocado flavour is another great one to get so I'll probably try it next time I go.  

The service was great but a little slow. There was only one customer in front of us so we didn't have to wait too long but I can see the waiting times increasing exponentially when there are more people. The server was super nice to us and split our waffle cone into two servings! We didn't know that this was an option until we heard the girls in front of us getting it. Essentially they cut the waffle into two and put each piece into a little cup, you have the choice of putting one full scoop of ice-cream in each cup or two half scoops of each flavour. This is great for sharing with your friends or when first trying out their flavours.",5
7211,"I called and someone picked up right away and I wasn't put on hold.  The person I spoke with, Sabrina, was very helpful.  She got a three-way call going with my insurance company, Progressive, and the entire call including processing my claim took less than 10 minutes.

This review is strictly on customer service, because I haven't had the work completed yet.  Mike is GREAT! He returned my call after hours, very nice, patient, and willing to come to me either st home or work to repair my wheel during the week.  I didn't feel rushed, he explained the process.  I felt very comfortable in booking with him to have the work done on Tuesday. Some other companies wanted me to bring in the tire and wheel. That's a problem since BMW vehicles do not have spares.

7220,"Hidden costs!  I was exhausted after the plane trip and knew they'd put a hold on my account for more than the rental.... But I didn't see the total until the hold came off my credit card!  I was wondering why/how the charge got up so much from a rate of $18 a day for four days. It was up nearly $100 dollars and I didn't purchase insurance!  

Hey Hertz! Why you gotta 'hert' people with junk fees!  Watch out for daily facilities fees!  Why? Why do I have a facility fee of $6.00 a day!  The car wasn't IN your facility while I was renting it...so why am I paying this? 

I purchased a full tank in advance. Don't do this! The clerk told me their gas was less expensive so I fell for it. The car had a 10 gallon tank. I found gas for $2.55. Hertz 'Hert' me with a $3+ charge per gallon. 

Looked at my receipt picture for all the other confusing charges.... Concession fee recovery? Hertz operating/maintenance fee? Receiving & Energy Fee?!?!?!?  Really? And tax...  15.30%. Don't know if the TAX is coming from the State or what but OMG.  

So Hertz, why not just call it what it is? If you want to charge me to cover so much overhead, go ahead.... JUST DONT LIE about it.  Don't tell people you have a great rate like you did me at $18 a day when after everything the rate's really going to be closer to $30 a day?  That's not counting the huge tax assessment or the tank of gas I over paid for. 

I might have been fine with this cost. $30 isn't a bad rate. But it's upsetting to feel like you've been lied to about what you were paying. It feels crappy to find out at the rental desk when you're there to pick up a rental car, that there's going to stupid petty little charges like facility and energy and maintenance....    Be more transparent.",1
7221,"My favorite restaurant in Calgary, and maybe in the world. 
The service is always excellent. Menu adventurous. I fell in love with this restaurant when I tried their lobster cappuccino at a wine and food tasting years ago. I have been back for many different occasions.

Only if I could afford to go there all the time ... :)",5
7223,"One star because I can't give zero.  Or maybe a star for the server - after her initial bitchiness i got the feeling that she felt sorry for my hungry ass.  Why?  Because it took about an hour for me to get my food - and when it came it wasn't worth the wait.  Here's the deal - I walked in alone and asked to be seated outside. The restaurant was crowded and the music really loud.   When I sat down a seemingly nice server came over took my drink order (hot green tea) and brought it over pretty quickly.  I had already decided what to have - I'm a creature of habit when it comes to sushi, so I placed the order, sat back and relaxed to enjoy reading my book.  About 15 minutes later, the server comes over to say that the sushi bar is slammed and that it will take 30 more minutes for my food to prepared.  When I communicated to her that I wasn't really happy about this, she told me that she'd understand if I left.  But where am I going?  By the time I get up and walk over to another restaurant, wait for a table and be served, it would take longer so I decide to stay.   What a mistake.  After half an hour comes and goes, I turn around to look inside and THERES NOBODY SITTING AT THE SUSHI BAR!!!  I was pissed!  Why am I waiting???  Apparently there were two large tables that ordered a lot of food, but WTF???  I'm one person who only ordered a few pieces of sushi for gods sake.  I finally say to the girl  - hey - can they at least send me a portion of my order???  So she comes back with half the order and about 10 minutes later the rest.   I take a bite and am gobsmacked to find the rice practically crunchy.  It was actually hard.   So I picked away most of the rice, ate the fish and asked for the check.  A manager came over and offered me a drink coupon for my next visit.  Did she not notice that I was drinking tea?   I told her that I don't live in the area and asked that she take something off the bill - which she did.  But nothing would inspire me to go to this restaurant again.  I mean, really - it's a large place that seats tons of people.  You'd think that they'd be prepared to feed the amount of people who occupy the place in a somewhat timely manner.  While it was crowded, it wasn't like there was a wait out the door and every seat filled.  Talk about poor management.  Find your sushi elsewhere in Scottsdale!",1
7224,"Wow, how did I not know this place existed and was also so close to me?!? And inside the world's cutest yellow house!

Macarons! Such a wide variety of flavour choices to choose from. It was hard to pick 3.
I also like how they have a separate bakery area from the macarons. So if you're just getting those like I was, the wonderful girl working that counter can serve you and then ring you up on an ipad.

While I was waiting someone ahead of me had ordered a macaron tree/tower and it was adorable.

The flavour of the treats themselves was exceptional, salted caramel FTW.

I am upset how the knowledge of this place will affect my wedding diet. Cause let me tell you, 3 macarons were not enough!",5

Thank you yosi vapes for the awesome service and wide selection of great products and knowledge!,5
7228,"What a surprise!  

Heartstrings is one of the newest editions to the Little Italy gallery hop/tour.  It's a vintage, antique store, and ""interesting things"" conglomeration housed in an old church.

I entered in and was immediately impressed with not only the open lofted space, but the organization and the wide variety of wares.  The owner has a real knack for style and staging!  Each room, beyond the church sanctuary is decorated appropriately with bright antiques combined in with plants, ribbons, and glass for effect.  There was a Country western nook, a flamingo nook, and outdoor nook, kitchen-ware and a dressing room that any fashionista would die for!  I wanted to bring the entire bathroom home with me, even the pile of pee pots!  

My antique go-to is horses and the owner helped me go through her store looking for the perfect equestrian momento.  She also mentioned she'll keep her eye out for me (you know how to get on my good side!).

Such a wide variety of items, all well displayed, fun, chic and...I mean, this is now a must-stop for gift buying for me!  Loved it! (and I love my new salt shakers!)",5
7232,"Was just there last week 11-4 to 11-6.  The hotel may have personality as a historic building but that is it.  Had a room in the 7th floor.  About 4:00 am all kind of vibration started. Called the front office and was told ""Oh yes,  sorry that is the A/C system on the roof, it does that everyday..."" - I was transferred to another room at the other side of the 7th floor.  No vibration from A/C there but the noise from the pipes was  the ""ghost"" that keep me awake.  In addition every room has a transom over the doors that is a ventilation grill that also allows light from the hallway to pass through.

Other points, be ready to duck out of the shower as the water temperature can change minute to minute.  Forget about eating at the hotel, they have no restaurant and or course no room service. 

Don't waste your money",1
7235,I got two margaritas here and the first one wasn't good. I told server guy that complement and he bring me another one. They put extra shot for the second one but i wasn't ask for that and they charged me double for my second margarita. They wanted me to pay 20$ for one margarita. This insane,1
7236,"Not only were they extremely pleasant to deal with, but have an EXCELLENT rating on Angie's list (as they should).  They helped me figure out the easiest way for my car to pass inspection.  They even have an early bird/night owl drop box so you can drop your car off early/late.  I'll be going back for any/everything my 'lil car needs.",5
7240,"I really liked this guy.  I brought my 9 year old stepson in for a new prescription and both he and his office assistant were very personable, knowledgeable, and fast.

Being in a Walmart really concerns me.  So much that I refuse to eat at the Subway or McDonalds that is in a Walmart but Dr. Roter is the exception to the rule.  He was very thorough with my stepson and took the time to talk to him and explain everything that he was doing.

My vision is fine, but if I ever need an optometrist I am coming here and will definitely return with the kid.  Safe bet for good, swift service.",5
7242,"So, this is an official check-in and update to my original review... The PV location is a different vibe from the others, and a lot of the clientele seem to be folks who are now parents, but still want to feel like they have a social life. I get it. 

Having said that, those that are seeking a kid-lite atmosphere might be happiest here on Sunday afternoons, when the kid-adult ratio is a little lower. On our third visit, we found that Sunday afternoon is our sweet spot! 

I'd like to give props to our server Gage who was awesome... He was very knowledgeable about the menu, and was able to make great recommendations. He was also genuinely friendly, attentive and on tops of things. 

That food was great, and the beer was cold. Couldn't ask for a better experience!!!",5
7246,"So so so happy to find out they had a location in Vegas! Love your location in San Diego ! There's no breakfast like this place. Huge portions, delicious plates of food and amazing service and ambiance. Everything on the menu is great.",5
7251,"Alamo is always on point. I pre-booked everything on their website. I spent no more than 10min total in the Rent-a-car center before I was driving out with my car. Staff is friendly and they don't try to sell you extra coverage you didn't book. Returning the car was even faster, they take the mileage, gas, and do 1 lap around the car for damages and you're out.",5
7253,"Came out here to celebrate my birthday like everyone else in the world lol. This time around I wanted to stay in the center of the strip instead of Circus Circus (Very cheap hotel). I was so happy with my whole experience and decision to stay here and for many reasons why...
I was able to check in very early around 1pm with no early fee added and most places wont let you do that without adding a fee. On top of my checking in experience, the front desk agent noticed on my ID that my birthday was just around the corner and she suprisingly upgraded my room to a SUITE!!! Im talking about the second to top level on the Mardi Gras tower and ive never stepped foot into any suite since coming to Vegas, so this was such an unbelievable treat added to my mini vacation.
Harrahs was already hitting the right notes with me and I felt nothing could go wrong.
I liked the fact they got a decent food court in the hotel and its also next to other restaurants and a Walgreens so I can save a little bit more when lady luck is not on my side.
Overall, this hotel/casino is definitely worth checking out especially if you dont have a car to drive up and down the strip, because this hotel is connected to a monorail that makes stops all the way north and south of the strip. I cant think of any other place to stay at after the type of treatment and experience I had. I honestly am ready to book another trip to stay here in the next few months, hopefully this time I can actually come out winning from the tables lol.",5
7255,"Today was the first time I stepped foot into Burger Stompers on Danforth. I was amazed at the cleanliness, the atmosphere and the super freindly staff. We discovered that we can actually eat there cause they have gluten free burgers and buns.  I was super suprised at the size of the burgers that came. The onion rings are now one of my favourites next to Harvey's.  Only downfall is it's very expensive.  I would still stay I highly recommend and revisit this place in the future.",5
7257,"This place is AMAZING! The food is on-point and the service (see Mike!!!) is killer. I came two days in a row for the boozy brunch. First day I had the Apple Pie Waffle, which was delicious!!!! The second day I had the Benedict....it just doesn't get any better. If you find yourself downtown, do yourself a favor and walk by Eat (as in DON'T stop) on your way to Glutton!",5
7258,"For years they have handled my flooring, tile, and countertops.  The installers always do a great job.  Nice to work with a family company instead of a chain.",5
7261,Amazing amazing food. You have to try the Brussels sprouts and Greek salad!! The Haloumi was great too,5
7266,"Absolutely great food served fresh, family owned and locally owned. This is not a fastfood place, this is quality. Great place to hang out and watch all the good fights, not to mention get a little eye candy. The shrimp tacos and wings are to die for.",5
7270,"DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM.

-LOCATION: Is not convenient!  it is only connected to Bellagio.  U have to take tram to aria or take outside sidewalk path to cosmopolitan.  Far back from the strip so lack view.

- POOL: had fecal matter (poop) so we had to leave the pool for them to sanitize it.  Another guest stepped on glass and cut his foot.  It is extremely windy where the pool is, where all your belonging including the lounge chairs gets pushed into the water when the wind picks up. Jacuzzi was dirty with leaves and bottle caps.

-SHOWER: leaks water into the bathroom area

- RUDE SERVICE:  I advised the front desk assistant mgr Anar Shah about the pool situation and she had the nerve to say ""I don't believe you.""  Talk about bad customer service!!!  And of course they didnt have staff to fix the shower leak.

-NO LATE CHECKOUT.  They don't know what a queue is!  They seem to think that all their housekeepers can clean all +500 check out rooms at the same time.  check out by 11 AM so us latebirds forget about!

-PULL OUT BED - no sheets, no extra pillows expect to have to request for it.

- CURTAINS - NO BLACKOUTS. They use roman shades so there are gaps between the shades.

For the price, I would go elsewhere where you get better service!  You're on vacation so make the most it where you are appreciated.",1
7274,"Customer service, y'all. The hombres here not only have bangin' Mexican food, but their service is humble, yet efficient. This is not your typical Americanized Mexican joint! The prices are a little higher, but the flavor and service make up for it. I ordered the tacos with chorizo and beef. Wow! Normally at another Mexican spot it comes plain, but here it came jam packed with seasonings and sauces. The meat was juicy and tender, and the spices were extremely flavorful. 

The chips and salsa were amazing too!

They are really good with big groups. We had a party of 16 and everyone was well taken care of. Definitely worth a revisit!",5
7278,"Great chiropractic care here. The doctor is very personable and trustworthy. 

I saw a chiropractor years ago, and it was nothing like here. It was not personal and I did not learn anything about my body or condition. 

Since I started seeing dr. Schutt, I have learned how to specifically take care of my condition and I have been in such a better mood because of it. 

I would recommend this place to anyone... Small problems, big problems, and even no problems.",5
7279,"I love Palm Beach tan on 1725 N Rainbow 89108.
All the staff are experts with the knowledge of the products that they sell there. They are all trained yes they went to training for this. These products are only sold here, I have a couple and YES they do work.  
The location is perfect the cleanliness of it is impeccable.  They have great packages that everyone can afford.  You can tan on the best sun tan beds I've ever been on, music, light spray of refreshing atomizer while tanning. Your relaxed and feel wonderful when your all done. I look forward to it every time.  Highly recommended I have become friendly with all the staff and they are all lovely ladies. I have pics and video to show you what I'm talking about so you can see for yourself.",5

7290,"The food here is great. The sinful pancake and breakfast tacos would probably be my last meal if I ever had to make a choice. It's always pretty busy, so it's okay when the kids let out an unexpected scream. Our server Christie was awesome. She was very good, always there with what we needed, but did not helicopter over the whole meal.",5
7291,"Fiorentina is without a doubt the best restaurant on the Danforth.  What Chefs Alex and Tina do with locally sourced food is brilliant.  Their brunches are deservedly famous - and so should be their dinners.  Their standards such as their charcuterie plate and beef tartar (rivals what you'd get in France) are consistently delicious.  Most of the items on the dinner menu change each week.  If you haven't been, you need to try it.",5
7292,"Disgusting.. don't go here. Food used to be good, but who knows what happened. Last time I went in a bunch of ""kids"" were working. I used to go here all the time. I ordered wings and they were literally inedible. Tastes nothing like the other locations.. this place has changed for the absolute worst. I can't believe it because I grew up going here. I mean it's just chicken.. how the hell could you mess that up so badly????",1
7294,"Every time I come here they get my order wrong. I swore I would never go here again but I was stupid and decided to try it again. And you know what they messed it up again. The staff here are incompetent and don't understand their own menu or what vegetarian means. 

Will never go to a Roberto's again.",1
7295,"AMAZING!!!! Perfect bedside maner and so very friendly. The ofice is big and clean and extreamly comfortable. I accidentaly arrived 90min early for my surgery and he fit me in emidiatly! 20min later sugery was over and i was on my way out. CRAZY FAST!! Had 2 teeth extracted. Hours later when the novicane wore off, there was zero pain what so ever. There was no exesive bleeding or soarness. Its like i took a 10min nap and 2 teeth dissapeard without trace. I would 100% go back to him for any future orthidontic issues. Two thumbs up!",5

I left with beautiful soft well manicured toes, painted for Disneyland !  Some nail salons make me feel like they are talking about me in a language I don't understand but never has this happened here. The people who work here are gentle, polite, efficient and most important CLEAN. Never had a problem with chipping polish and they do amazing jells also. Give it a try you will be happy!",5

Okay so you felt a lil selfish and want your GF or the little man/woman in your life to match the pair of Jordans you just bought for yourself? They have probably have them too!

They also carry a handful their own brand of UNDFTD clothing, hats, caps and accessories along the opposite side of their sneakers. Nice, clean layout. Conveniently located next to Stussy.

Dope music? Check. Unpretentious workers? Check. Pretentious customers? Check. Come outta the store a little more broke? Check.",5
7303,"What a fantastic restaurant, especially during Restaurant Week! The food overall was really good and at a very good value on Restaurant Week prices. The outdoor patio is cute and there was a live jazz band when we visited on a Saturday evening. I had:

- Vegetarian Tostadas: Yum! The guacamole and chipotle aioli was quite delicious and nicely balanced the sweet cabbage
- 12 Vegetable Enchiladas: Amazing! These have to be the best vegetarian enchiladas I've ever had - real vegetables with a lot of flavor instead of just cheese.
- Bread Pudding: This was the only average food item we had all night. I just didn't love the combination of fruit and chocolate and cinnamon - personal flavor preference.
- Jalapeno Creamed Corn: Oh my gosh delicious. Sweet & hot at the same time - I highly recommend this side dish.
- Chipotle Cheddar Mashed Potatoes: Also really great - full of flavor and very satisfying.

The service we received while at Fuego Bistro was excellent. Our server was great and provided prompt service without being intrusive. She was also very observant - I ordered a vegetarian appetizer & entree, and had selected vegetarian-sounding sides that actually were not. She asked if I was vegetarian and let me know that the sides I had selected actually contained bacon. Now that's great service!",5
7307,"Great people serving better food. Rustic, homey / personal feel. Ask to be seated in the back terrace, it's classic plateau",5
7308,A wonderful hidden gem. You would never think to head down this street. I actually saw a Yelp suggestion and decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did. Now all I'm thinking about is what to try next.,5

7314,"Arizona Catering was our caterer of choice for our reception at Portico Weddings.  Portico recommends we use one of their two caterers, but it isn't mandatory.  We tried both of them, and Arizona Catering won us over with their hospitable tasting event right at Portico and individual conversations with couples who were there sampling the menu.  I loved the tasting nights... everything we tried was fantastic.

We ended up with the same spinach, strawberry, poppyseed salad that Heather described in her review, and I concur that it was phenomenal.  We had rosemary chicken that was so tender it could have been cut with a spoon.  The garlic mashed potatoes and Hawaiian sweet rolls topped it all off.  It was so good. I wish I hadn't been such a nervous bride, unable to eat much!  Everyone I talked to commented on how good the food was, and I heard several times it was the best wedding food some had ever had.  I have zero frame of reference on that, but it was awesome.  

The servers kept things moving and were very friendly.  They cut and served our cake, and got the tables cleared in a timely manner.  I'm so happy with the whole thing, and really glad we chose Arizona Catering!",5

7318,"If I could leave no stars I would. I went to Pravda with a girl friend on Friday around 10:30. There was a line up which we got in and started to queue. As we inched closer to the front we over heard the bouncer (with a sad man bun) say that he could not let anyone in until 25 ppl leave the venue. Understandable for safety reasons and as my friend and I were next in line he continued to say we could not go in yet. Yet, 2 girls who jumped the line and chatted the bouncer up saying they didn't have reservations but would love to go in - he let them in when it was my friend and I who should have been next. We continue to wait for an hour. Another lady comes to the front of the line from the side and chatted up the bouncer explaining that the wait was long but she really wanted to try the place. He also let her and her friends in!!! When we called him out on it he said it was his childhood friend. First of all that is irrelevant had it been true because we were still next in line and there would have still been a safety hazard 25 ppl over!!!!Secondly, we overheard their entire conversation and know that she did not know him before then. Interestingly all the ladies who were let in were all Caucasian. My friend and I were ethnic minorities and I'm not racially sensitive as we live in Toronto for God sakes but never had I experienced such rude behaviour at any establishment (even worse clubs). When my friend expressed her issue and asked why other were let in who clearly jumped the line the man bun bouncer said I don't tell you how to do your job so don't tell me how to do mine. Obviously I decided not to give my money to Pravda and had a wonderful evening elsewhere. Will definitely never go back there!",1
7319,"Saffron is a wonderful Indian restaurant. The ambiance is very elegant and warm; it makes you want to stay or get a drink at the nice bar. The buffet, and let's face it buffets are why we eat Indian in the first place, was well stocked with a variety of delicious, perfectly spiced dishes. The nan bread was some of the best I've had, just light enough but very filling.",5

Very clean place,staff very courteous and obliging.I had the corned beef sandwich for lunch which was good,i would've said great but they didn't have spicy brown mustard that is must for my sandwiches,lol. Green tea was great.  I was also pleasantly surprised that Wifi was at a adequate strength and FAST! Cozy and calm ambience. Fantastic place to get some work done or read. One last note this place is cashless, debit/credit cards only.",5
7324,"First off let me say that I have PTSD and have been diagnosed with claustrophobia so with that said I hate to go to a dentist. I met Dr. Glynn through my Business partner  and I told him I really need some work on my teeth and I need to get the old silver fillings replaced because I heard that they are not healthy. Dr. Glynn made me feel so comfortable and at ease that he would take care of me and I would be safe. I made the appointment and was very very nervous and hardly slept the night before. Dr. Glynn prescribed me some medicine to take the edge off. I took the medicine and went to his office. I felt so at ease and he was very professional and attentive to my comfort. When he finished and I went home I looked in the mirror and was so happy with my smile and the work he preformed.  He also called me a couple days later so see how I felt and if I had any issues, I had never had a dentist follow up with me before. I would refer everyone to go see Dr. Glynn, I am so very happy with his work that I want to tell everyone. Very professional, attentive, caring, and a awesome dentist. Thank you Dr Glynn I will never go anywhere else.",5
7327,"I'll start by saying that I've flown Allegiant about 10 times and have never had any significant delays or cancelations on any of those flights.

That being said, EVERYONE else I know who's flown Allegiant has horror stories of sitting in airports (if you're lucky) for 8+ hours, only to have the flight cancelled.  The phone line is a joke; under an hour wait is unheard-of, and many times you'll be hung up on by the system.  The app is worse than Facebook on Android.

I actually just took a friend to catch a flight at Phoenix-Mesa airport and the ticket people told us that the flight was cancelled, delayed, and on time (3 seperate ticket employees standing within ten feet of each other) all 3 at the same time!  Nobody seems to know anything, and they definitely aren't going to refund you or make you feel like you have any other option then to suck it.

Here's the deal:  Allegiant books more flights than they can keep planes in the air and in functioning condition.  That's the simple fact why your plane was delayed for no apparent reason.  

They had a plane for your flight, let's assume, and it didn't pass inspection.  That means they have to re-route another plane to come pick you up.  That plane could be fairly close, pass inspection itself, and you might get delayed an hour or two.  

On several occasions, however, things don't go quite so smooth.  The plane has to come from far away and it's already full of other people, it doesn't pass inspection either, and any number of issues.  This means your flight could be delayed 8+ hours and at some point, the flight crew that was gonna fly you to wherever is going home and there's nobody left to fly; flight cancelled.

You need to do a cost/benefit analysis that takes into account the risks of flying airlines like this.  

If you NEED to be there on time; fly a more reputable airline and pay the extra  $$$.  

If you have the time and money to waste at the airport bar & gril, fly Allegiant and accept the fate that chance deals you!  

I suggest driving; there's a lot to see and experience  around this country and you get to keep your belt and shoes on.  Additionally, you'll, most likely, have to smell less of other people's farts.",1

7330,"We ran in to buy a special ""gourmet"" birthday treat for our dog. The store is completely over stocked and the cleanliness is poor and the smell!  EWWWWWW! The gentleman at the register seems like he was asleep. As we looked at the display of $5++ treats, we noticed bugs crawling on them. We mentioned this to the man at the register and he mumbled something and shrugged his shoulders. Actually, I am unsure if he was even listening.  Needless to say we got outta there without buying any treats. I will never go back there.",1
7331,"Wow! I'm very impressed by the food from this truck. I'm usually not overly impressed with food truck food, the portions are usually a little small for the price and the food usually isn't amazing. This is not the case for Burgh Bites though! I got the Rastafarian and was blown away by the amount of flavor in the wrap. The jerk chicken had a great flavor and was cooked perfect. They used chicken thighs which really helped. The corn mango salsa was perfect as well, and the pepper aioli had a nice kick and added a nice creaminess to the sandwich. The price wasn't bad and the wrap was big and filled me up. It also came with a few of their homemade tortilla chips which very different, good different though, and a pickle, which also tasted homemade. The other dishes I saw from people looked delicious as well. I highly recommend this place!",5
7332,"If I could give them no stars I would! I bought their groupon, and called them several times to schedule an appointment. They never returned my calls. Then when I finally got an appointment scheduled they cancelled it the day of only two hours before the appointment time. The only day that they could do it was the day before we were moving out of state. They came, did the car, I tipped him $20 and then I never looked inside until after my car got shipped to WA. When I saw the job he did I was furious! It was disgusting! The interior that he had wiped down had soap scum, he hadn't moved any of the seats to clean around them or under them, and the cup holders were filthy! (We had just bought this vehicle from someone off CL which is why I wanted it detailed in the first place.) When I called the owner to ask for a partial refund he was curt and said that we should have inspected it, and he wasn't responsible. I told him that I thought that it was ridiculous that he as a professional detailer and business owner should have to be told how to do their job. He said that I was just bitching over dirty cup holders and insinuated that I was just being cheap. Long story short, the job was terrible, and the customer service was even worse. Luckily, Groupon refunded my account for it. I have a feeling, though, that karma is going to hurt this company! Save your time and money and DO NOT use this company! They have an F rating with the BBB, and their own website has typos on it. Wish I would have done my research first!",1
7334,"Decided to use the computers but the lady host signaled for us to start waiting in line. We asked her how long the wait would be about and she replied within 20-25 minutes. This was an absolute lie. It was not even close to 20-25 minutes. By the time we paid at the front of the line, we had already waited for 1.5 hours. After paying, we waited another half hour in the exact same spot! We had tickets to a show so we decided to just leave the line because there was little to no hope for us to actually get seated. I understand generally buffets have long waits, but it was ridiculous for the host to tell us 25 minutes when we waited 2 hours without even being able to see the very front of the line. Overall HORRIBLE experience for everyone.",1
7337,"Ate dinner here for a work function and we had a pre-selected menu and based on what was preselected I was as a huge fan. We started with the best Charcuterie trays I have had. They had fresh grilled Tiger Prawns (apparently they come from Rocky Point daily), a great Burrata, Grilled Artichokes, Smoked Salmon, cured meats and tomatoes and Mozzarella. 

We also got the Bologna's Pappardelle and Mushroom Risotto prior to our Entrees. Both were great. I had the 12oz Sirloin which they cooked to a perfect Medium Rare. The accompanying asparagus and fingerling potatoes were also good. 

The meal was capped of by possibly the best Tiramisu I have had. The flavor was fantastic!",5

7341,"Cleveland Bagel Co. bagels can be found around town at Pour, Platform Brewing, and a number of other hip hotspots. These are the real deal and every bit as good, or if I dare say so, even better than the esteemed NYC bagel (no hate mail please). The bagels are a gorgeous slightly off-circle shape, with a luscious slight crunch to the exterior when toasted, and delicately leathery pull, with a perfectly chewy center. Highly recommend the everything bagel, which features the perfect blend of sesame, poppy, salt, and any number of other goodies. Somehow these manage to stay fresh and tasty long after other ""bagels"" have lost their fluffiness. I'm surprised methheads haven't taken to using these as a form of alternate currency in lieu of Tide, they're that good. Find your local Cleveland Bagel Co. retailer and run, don't walk for you're little round piece of heaven.",5

From looking to buying to pick up, everyone was very courteous and helpful. 
They loaded it up into our pickup safely and securely. We even found a beautiful fake plant bush while we were waiting for our items. There is a food area and lots of outdoor furniture and accessories as well. We will definitely be back.",5
7345,"Food was delicious but the place filled up quickly so be forewarned.  I would have totally done the AYCE but with two kids under 2, it wasn't a possibility.  Service was great too.  Definitely worth more visits next time I'm in LV.",5

I thought I was going to a tanning salon, and I thought that was a strange place for her to have moved to. Until I got there and realized how awesome this place is. Its a little day spa with soooo many cool things to choose from. (As well as some tanning beds). I especially loved the Red light therapy facial. And Im sooo going back for the full red light therapy bed and the Hydro Derma fusion. I could literally spend all day there. And the prices are not bad for an entire day of relaxing treatments!

7350,"Best egg rolls EVER!!  Food is always fresh, STEAMING hot and the service is always friendly!  We sometimes go here just to get a bunch of egg rolls and some egg drop soup!",5
7351,"Best meal I had during my entire trip to Montreal.  Amazing food and in a completely unpretentious atmosphere that's cool, comfortable and casual.  It's a unique space with friendly people and while it's expensive it's not overpriced at all.  Well worth every cent we paid.  Suzanne was our server and she was awesome.  Everything she suggested was spot on.  Plus she was just so friendly we actually joked that it would be nice to ask her to join us for dinner.  Weird, right?  But weird in the best way possible.  Definitely check out Joe Beef!  You'll be glad you did.

PS, don't be intimidated when they tell you the strip steak is a large portion.  It is like a meat brick!  But days later I'm still having dreams about how damn good it was.",5
7352,"Oh boy! This one hurts me to write. I really enjoy the food from Joe's. The pizza is one of my favorites in Las Vegas. However, I will never eat there or order from there again. This is a customer service review, or lack there of. I was thinking of the best way to take in this golden knights Stanley cup playoff game. I couldn't think of any thing other to eat than my favorite pizza, Joe's. The only problem is they don't deliver to my neck of the woods. But thank god for grub hub. I ordered my dinner from them at 6:26pm and my pizza eta was 7:10-7:25, not too bad. So I waited, and waited, and waited. Finally the clock strikes 8:00 and I'm hungrier than Rosie O'Donnell after 10mins on the stair master. So I give Joe's a call just to make sure everything is on the up and up. Well thats where my story sadly takes a turn for the worst. A young lady by the name of Sara (who turns out to be the manager) with a snarky attitude informs me that they were ""VERY BUSY, and received in TWO whole orders at the same time"" and then went on to say ""well yeah we didn't check our tablet, did you want us to cancel your order? Next time you can call us to order it for delivery"" I say ""well I'm sorry but I ordered on grub hub because you don't deliver to my house"" ""YES WE DO. MY delivery driver would've taken the order to you"" so I ask ""your driver works for grub hub?"" ""Well no but they deliver"" So I say ""yes please cancel my order"" then I pause and say ""I love the food here and I'm just disappointed with your customer service, I unfortunately won't be back here."" She then goes to say ""well I told you to order over the phone next time. I would say that I could comp your next meal but you said the you're never coming back so no use in offering that to you now, is there?!"" Wow just wow. Sad and hungry is where I am now. I feel like I'm wasting away faster than ***Spoiler Alert*** Spiderman at the end of Avengers Infinity Wars. ""Mr. Yelp, I don't feel so good.......""",1
7353,Can you give a zero review?? Seriously- the only reason Budget at Sky-Harbor Airport in Phoenix is getting one star is because I feel bad for the nice folks who are having to deal with the grumpiness of all of us. Almost all of us had reservations and yet the wait was ridiculously long- oner an hour thirty minutes (no exaggeration). Got a car at Avis last week at same airport and it was much more efficient.,1
7354,"Horrible customer service, it took 5 minutes after we found a spot and sit then the waitress realize we are here. It is not a busy day, 4 tables are empty. The first thing she said to is to sit at another table. Food is average and priced above other place. I will not come again.",1
7355,"Perfect. I was in and out in 20 minutes with a tire replacement. Everyone was really nice. If you're a budget shopper for used tires like myself, this is the perfect place for you. They were working on new tires for another customer and I watched how detailed and attentive they were. Highly recommended!",5
7356,"Dim sum here is excellent. This is the one go-to spot for my mom and I. There is sometimes a wait during the weekends but it's nothing atrocious. Food here is always fresh and tasty, I've never had a complaint. The only place that is comparable to here is probably ping ping pong. Other than that this is one of the best dim sum places in Vegas.",5
7357,"I'm not sure if I'm lucky or if it's super dangerous, but Mastrioni's is a few blocks from our new house and after seeing it on Yelp we've been anxious to try it out. Decided to go on a whim for my Mother's birthday after she asked for ""hole in the wall"" Italian. Well, there's nothing ""hole in the wall"" about Mastrioni's... it's a classy little joint in a non-descript strip mall on Hualapai. We have a two year old, which is the main reason we haven't been here sooner since it's not really a ""kid-friendly"" spot,  but I figured a Wednesday night would probably be slow and safe. Not so much. By 7 o'clock this place was jam packed! Thankfully, the little criminal behaved wonderfully and we got to enjoy one of the better Italian dinners we've had in a long time. We had calamari and crab cakes for appetizers, calamari was good but the crab cakes were excellent. Mom had the bone in rib-eye, hubs had the seafood linguine and I had linguine and clams. This is your tried and true Italian, better than probably any other I've had in Vegas and would rival any of my favorite spots in California. I'd say it's more like $$$, but they are very generous with the portions/seafood. Dessert was excellent as well and service was on point. We will definitely be back and will probably become our new date night spot.",5
7358,Slowest service ever. The beer was okay tended to be on the bitter side of things. Bread pudding while buzzed is pretty top notch though. They use their pious monk beer in the cinnamon creme drizzle over the ice cream and pudding.,1
7359,"Love Love Love me some Trader Joe's. 
Parking.... park in the back. You don't have to deal with the craziness in the front. There is a safe walkway right to Trader Joe's from the back parking lot so you don't have to walk around the shopping center. 
Service is usually great. 
The selection is even better. 
My dad was recently diagnosed with a disease and he has to eat completely gluten free. I'm really thankful for Trader Joe's. They have an awesome and yummy at that, selection of gluten free items. 
They also have a great selection of cards for ONLY A DOLLAR. They are all artsy and cool and always a great conversation piece. Whenever there is a birthday or I need a thank you card I go straight to Trader Joe's. 
I love their ginger snaps, their breads, frozen waffles, cheeses, everything.... you reallly cannot go wrong at Trader Joe's... if you haven't been.... please pass on your regular harris teeter trip and do yourself a favor and go to trader joes... I promise you'll be return more than once. 
Also, located in a shopping center that has great places around it (ups...greenway...starbucks...cvs...etc. so you can make many stops in one car ride...coffee...exercise...pick up your meds...and get your groceries... and if you need to take some dance lessons for your upcoming wedding...don't worry they have that too ( at the dance academy that is) 

Yeah, I'm a fan.",5
7360,Pretty good tasting sushi for the happy hour prices. Service was great also. Many options to choose from. Definitely will be coming back.,5
7361,"One of the gems in the city. It would make my top 10 places to visit in Toronto.

Everyday they have a beautiful and great garden centre that is open. We buy our heirloom tomatoes there every spring/summer. They also have a good variety of succulents and pots. At Xmas they have a huge variety of Xmas trees but I've never bought one there. They aren't cheap and I haven't graduated to a real tree yet. Probably next year.

On the weekend they have a very large farmers market. The Saturday one is bigger and the different days have different vendors. If you are there on a Saturday I recommend the breakfast crepe from the food court. It's a staple for us on any visit to the farmers market. Another staple is starting the visit at Cafe Belong inside for coffee and either one of there delicious biscuits or one of the other baked goods. You won't want to miss these.

If you wonder around or attend some of the ticketed events they hold (cask days, food truck awards, etc) you'll eventually find some old brick ovens. In that same area is where they've had the winter village as well. They also make a little skating loop right beside it. Though one of the best parts about brickworks is the back where the old quarry was that is converted into a park with ponds filled with turtles and fish and pathways you can stroll around on.

The only downfall to this place is you have to pay to park. And if you come for the farmers market around 10am forget about finding a spot. Come earlier or later. Though if you are coming from the east side you can easily bike there now. Though watch out for the scary hill on pottery rd :)",5
7363,"Happy to see a new restaurant open up in the neighbourhood. It is much bigger than what I thought and great for families or large groups. I loved the decor and my fianc√© appreciated that he could Ignore me to watch the blue jays on one of the multiple screens in the restaurant. We ordered
A caprese salad, calamari and pizza rolls to start. All were delicious, in particular the shrimp and calamari were perfectly cooked and were not overly battered. The pizza via mercanti - double decker- was delicious. The service was fantastic from start to finish. We will definitely be back.",5
7364,"If you want results SWEAT is the place to be! If you wants friends and family SWEAT is the place to go! I have never felt better and a complete person since I had donets challenge and I owe it to all the staff at SWEAT.

7365,"I've always enjoyed myself here. Everything I've tried from the menu was great. Fresh and homemade tasting. Friendly staff and a fun, slightly older crowd.",5
7366,ASK FOR HENRY LOPEZ!  Great customer service!!!  The best place for high-end work shoes - especially boots - and hiking shoes.  Great selection for a small store but also had options to order the right fit or style if they don't have it.,5
7369,"My first time taking my sons to a real barber shop was last week. My boys desperately needed cuts. Both are tender headed. My 5 year old is a busybody, so I was nervous he would move and mess up the cut or the barber would get annoyed. James did the cuts and he was incredibly patient with both boys, even when my 5 year kept moving and crying because he didn't want a hair cut, James showed no signs of irritation, even with me being the hovering mom that I am. Another barber was there, I don't remember his name. Both guys were welcoming, hilarious, and helped me feel comfortable about the experience. Both of my boys got great cuts and we have a barber. Thanks James!",5
7370,"What poor customer service!!!!
I sipped a box priority (2-3 day delivery) via Pebble Post Office on the 8th. As of the 11th, the package was not delivered. After the weekend, I returned to the Post Office to follow up on my package. Once there, I was told there was no way to find it without a receipt. Ok. The package returned to my home on the 17th; over a week after it was to be delivered. 
I call the office and spoke with Cheryl, the supervisor, about what happened. She was of no help. I came to the office directly  after speaking the her. How convenient, she was out within 10 minutes of our conversation. The staff were of no help. Soon as I got into the car, I called them post office to speak with Cheryl. She just happened to be available. What game are these folks playing?? 
Not only do they not want to speak to customers, they don't want to accept responsibility for there terrible service they provide. We pay taxes for that? No wonder the postal offices are closing. These ""people"" don't care about service, only a pay check. Save us some tax money, close the useless postal service.",1
7371,"The Chicken and Apple Cheddar Waffles were amazing!! A must try! We say outside and had the perfect view of the Bellagio and saw the fountain show. They have a Happy Hour, but only honored at the bar unfortunately. It would be nice to honor the Happy Hour wherever you'd like to sit because they have good specials.",5
7372,100% amazing. 10/10 will get mind blown. Would recommend again.,5
7373,Great service and even better food! The breading on the chicken is to die for and the waffles are delicious!,5
7374,"I loved this place. The music was awesome (man that DJ was GOOD), the crowd was moving, and the staff was the friendliest I've encountered in Las Vegas. We reserved a table here for Saturday night and couldn't have asked for a better time. I made my reservation via FreeVegaspasses.com. The club was crowded but there was still enough space to dance. I mean it looked like everyone was having a good time. The decor is sexy and slick. Unfortunately, we had to leave a little early  because our friend had too much to drink but even when they were kicking us out their staff was gracious and apologetic. Definitely not the typical bouncer attitude in Vegas. If you're looking for an Ultra Lounge where you can dance the night away, The Cathouse is the place to go.",5
7384,They fucked my car up. Came in fr a lining made me way 3 hours just to get a call it couldn't get fixed cause of other problems.. I was fine with it but soon as I'm leaving the place my dash board lights come on.. you can't trust mechanics,1
7385,"We visited this place during our family trip to Las Vegas after a long day. We were very hungry and were looking forward to eating good Indian food.  The place had almost closed for an event next day, but the owner was very accommodating.   He agreed to provide ""To-Go"" food as most servers had left.  The place has simple ambiance, friendly staff and good quality food.  We ordered vegetarian dishes and they were tasty.  One of them had excess oil, but it could be due to last minute rush in the kitchen as the other dish (mixed veg) was good. This place has unique desserts and are worth trying.
With unique name, good service and tasty food, I expect  this business will be one of the most popular Indian restaurants in Las Vegas and recommend it.",5
7386,Terrible experience!!!!! It literally took our server 15 minutes to greet us (there was only 3 tables sat so no excuse) after she said she would give us a minute to look over the menu she took an additional 15 minutes to come back. They brought our food out at completely different times so my wife got her meal first 10 minutes before I got mine. They forgot to ring in one of our orders so it didn't come out at all. They gave me a rare burger when I asked for well done. I will never go back. Oh and it was our anniversary so it totally ruined our lunch date.,1

7391,"I had breakfast at the Chompie's at the Mercado Del Rancho Center and it pains me to write that this breakfast stands out as the worst breakfast I have ever had, ever. If you think about it, you really have to go out of your way to screw up breakfast but they managed.

We knew we were off to a bad start when we stood at the entrance for about 5 minutes (Please Wait to be Seated) for someone to seat us in a 1/2 empty dining room. The waiter was attentive so no problems there. The problems started when the food arrived. 3 of us had menu variations of corn-beef hash and poached eggs. The corn-beef had the look and texture of road kill and the eggs were hard boiled. 2 of us requested that the eggs be re-done but only one of us received it after assurances from the wait staff that it was ""on its way..."". The food was also more or less room temp when it arrived.

To be fair, there are a lot of Chompie's and maybe this was a bad day at a singe location. The menu is extensive and I did see other customers orders that looked more appetizing. It would appear that they have good food but the execution was the problem. We might try it again and order something different.",1
7392,"BOTTOM LINE: Tech geek's wet dream FTW! This place has the best components at the best prices, though their ""customer loyalty"" program is laughably bad.

This is the only store I go to for computer equipment simply because it has the best selection of quality components at the best prices. I have no idea why they've moved 4 or 5 times in the past 10 years within the same 1-block radius, but its current location has been their largest.

While the store can be a bit intimidating if you're a tech n00b, I think their customer service has really improved over the years so that you actually get good advice if all you want is a new laptop. At the very least, the staff have way better knowledge than staff from the big box stores. 

But for those who enjoy building their own system be it a gaming station, home computer or a home media centre, you will have access to quality components (HDDs, cables, network storages, cases and enclosures, etc.). I've stopped by on a few occasions to discuss potential setups and the staff have always made some great recommendations. 

Perhaps of more comedic value than anything else, is their ""customer loyalty"" program whereby you can collect points to purchase shitty prizes like water bottles, toy robots and garish clocks time warped from the '80s. It's like getting first dibs to the garbage dump from the comfort of your own home! Can't wait to redeem my water bottle after spending $200 on computer parts - IT WILL BE MINE! W00t!",5
7393,Had a blast here this past weekend. Brian Pfeiffer helped set us up with a bottle service for my friends bachelorette party at Light. The process was easy and we were in the club and having fun in no time. He was great to work with and always kept in touch and followed up. Thanks again Brian!,5
7395,"My daughter took me here for mother's day and we were both disappointed as it was our first time here.  When we walked in there were a few people waiting so we checked in with hostess, she asked how many and said it will be 15 minutes. ... and I said do you need our name?  She said no,  I have it under control.  About 15 minutes later,  she comes out to the lobby and ASKS US IF WE'RE NEXT!  How the hell do we know? That's your job!  (we didn't actually say that,  but thinking it) Ok, so once we were seated, we literally waited 10 min before someone took our drink order.   I ordered the Asiago peppercorn sirloin which looked delicious on the photo. When it came out,  you could see the cheese slices on the meat. They weren't even melted. The whole experience was very disappointing. We won't be going back.",1
7396,"Was totally dissapointed in this spa!  I went in for a 75 minute massage which ended up being about 60 minutes as she apparently took the 15 minutes she tried to upgrade me on product into the total time slot.  I did fall for the ""coconut oil"" which sounded great as my skin is really sensitive and I though this would help.  I think any normal person would expect a small upgrade in oil to run maybe $5-$10 bucks at most but nope - it was $20!!  Are you kidding me?  I realized this at the counter of course because she failed to mention that.  Stupid me for not recognizing a scammer and asking ahead of time!  The massage was just ok - nothing amazing.  This place is definitely overpiced.  I would rather head to a resort and take the amenities that actually come along with the higher price - like a comfy robe, a locker, a sauna, pool, etc!!!",1
7397,"Customer Service is KEY. First time going to GEN Korean BBQ House and was recommended by my brother. I was under the impression kids age 5-10 was 10$ but i was surprised when they measured my son to see if he was going to be full price. They said its new. So right off the bat got a little upset because my 8 year old son who is now paying full price hardly eats as much as an adult. Not their fault but I wish kids price was still in effect. Barely no wait time on a Saturday. So with a doubtful attitude, we began to order. Terry our server definitely changed the night. Always checking our drinks were filled and recommending what to try. At no time did we feel rushed to eat and leave like many all you can eat restaurants. The manager stood out to me as well because he was constantly walking around and even picked up some plates at our table. WHAT! What manager does that nowadays! Overall 5 stars and will be a great spot to try for those who have not.",5
7398,This place is so much fun and really adds a great twist with the fajitas being served flaming at your table.  Casual atmosphere but not your typical Mexican Restaurant.  I recommend it to anyone.  The margaritas are good too!,5
7399,"We went in a small group: - two families with 3 kids on Thanksgiving Monday. Place was less than busy for lunch and that made our 40 minute wait for food completely unexplainable. The waitress was incredibly rude and indifferent. After 30 minutes of waiting, with all the kids crying for their food, we asked how much longer it would take, and she shrugged indifferently. It took ten more minutes to get our order: one fish and chips, three sandwiches, two kiddie grilled cheese sandwiches and one kids' chicken fingers. Hardly gourmet fare that takes a while to cook. At no point during this time did anyone ask us how we are doing or whether we want anything. My fish and chips was burned on the outside and raw inside. Left it after two bites. My son's chicken fingers at $10 a child's meal were three frozen shaped pieces of chicken that is sold for $2.99 a box in every supermarket freezer and a bunch of soggy fries. Absolutely appalling. He is not a big eater but after he gulped down that pitiful portion he asked where is the rest. I had to feed him again when we got home. To top it all off, we had to wait another 20 minutes for our bill, until another server took pity on us and produced it. Absolutely the worst dining experience in Oakvile ever. Maybe if all you want is beer on a Friday night this is a decent place, but I would suggest to any family to go nearby Burloak and try one of the restaurants there - you will eat better and spend less.",1
7400,This is the place to go! Clean! The receptionist went out of her way to get us an appointment and make us feel welcome. Patrick was my therapist and gave me one of my best massages ever!!,5
7402,"The breakfasts at Emily's are amazing- fresh and flavorful. Highly recommend the French Toast.  I read on Yelp that the owner, Kathy, has sold the business, which is not true. Only recomendation I have is that I think they need more waitstaff as the girl that works during the week is a bit slow.",5
7403,"In a word, amazing!! The food was fantastic, service was on point without hovering. The menu selection was incredible with lots of what you would expect for Italian but with a unique twist of an unexpected flavor. Every item was perfection. A little disappointed by the small wine selection. We friend a lot of different items and the price was very good for The Strip. Will go back again and will definitely treat friends when they come in town to visit.",5
7405,"The service was fine until we showed our waitress the Groupon..... After that, we waited a half an hour after we finished our meal before we got any attention- we had planned on ordering a dessert but ran out of time. The pesto pasta was decent, the risotto was watery and had very little flavor. I would not return at full price. If you purchase the groupon, make sure to hide it until the last moment. I am a frequent grouponer and this was, unfortunately, one of the very few less than satisfactory experiences I have had.",1
7410,"Amazing !!!!! 
So first impression, the outside seating area is perfect for cool Arizona nights. 
The food was really good and I would recommend the dinotte it was by far the best thing. The crepes were also good but I could live with out them. The ice tea was very delicious and the restrooms are clean. This place was great and the atmosphere was awesome",5
7413,"Bad. I had to take my car to get fixed and my new puppy needed food, so I called clean air cab to take me to pet co. I was quoted 25 minutes maximum and 30 minutes later I called back to see where my can was because it hadn't arrived nor did I get a call with an ETA. The person I spoke with said they would have the driver contact me. I called back again because I hadn't recieved a call. The girl on the phone told me the driver tried to call and since I didn't answer he left. I had no missed calls and when I asked them to verify my number to see if my contact information was correct, it was all right. Hmm? So I asked another cab to be sent out and got quoted another 30 minutes. This is not the first time this has happened either. I only use clean air because they're cheap, but if you need to be somewhere on time, stick to discount cab, they're pretty realiable and the fare is decent. You'll save yourself a lot of hassle.",1
7414,"Maybe other Sam Woo BBQ restaurants are better but we just had a terrible experience at the one in Vegas last night.  We ordered the 2 item combo that had roasted duck and roasted pork, 3 Flavor chow mein, and Chinese broccoli.  The chow mein and broccoli came out pretty quick but then we waited for 15 min or longer but the duck and pork still had not arrived!  We saw another table get a big plate of duck too.  WTF?  We finally asked our waiter where our duck and pork is and he said ""Oh, we're out of duck and pork.  I'm sorry I forgot to tell you.""  Are you fucking kidding me?  You ""forgot"" to tell us???  Then my friend asked ""Do you have duck?""  The guy said no but then when we asked again, he said that they have duck.  OMG!  We got the plate, which is $9.20 for 2 pieces of duck.  There's 3 size servings for duck.  Whole, half, and plate.  When we got the bill, they charged us $14.95 for the 2 pieces of duck!  We didn't really question it at first and the paid.  As we walked out, I said ""Fuck that, there's not way that duck was $14.95!!!"" and I went back inside to look @ the menu.  They never took off the charge of the 2 item of duck and pork that we never got!!!!  They gave us the $6.25 that was due back to us.  Yeah, not going back here again.  Always scrutinize the bill when eating out and don't be afraid of questioning the bill if you see something wrong.",1
7415,I haven't been here in 7 months since my last review and I'm just gonna say service has always been great here . Today the food was awesome we had three different flavor wings and mann it was some nice crunchy chicken not that soft BS great food check pics out!!!!,5
7417,"Quality place! The prices are dirt cheap. They have a lot of police buy back weapons that are surprisingly in great shape. Staff is friendly and knowledgable. The negative reviews of this place are all wrong. These guys do everything by the book. Have I mentioned the prices? It's a wonder that anyone would buy a gun from anywhere else. Make sure to check them out first before buying a gun. They don't have a ton of accessories and holsters, but they have a few that are pretty good quality.",5
7418,"Just completed cataract surgery at Bell Rd office.  The many people, from the staff to the nurses and doctors, were exceptional!

He had to deal with a severe case of astigmatism and cataracts and now my vision is 20/20!  What a wonderful, gifted doctor!  Dr. Myers has been following up with my post op appointments.  She has shared my joy and excitement.  Answering all my questions and listening to me rant about my ""new world"", she is a jewel!  Many, many thanks to each of the caring people at Southwestern Eye Center. I am truly grateful.",5
7419,"Ms. Deb made me feel very comfortable. I just felt like she was a kind person with a warm smile, as well as a good story teller. 

The close proximity of being measured etc by a person you don't know didn't freak me out, but did make me uncomfortable enough to avoid getting my bridesmaid dress altered until the last minute. 

The prices were reasonable despite my very limited time window and the purple chiffon dress fit like a glove when she was done with it. I will be back!",5
7420,Very good love the service and the curry noodles the bombs..,5
7424,So my wife has been raving about this place ever since she and her friends ate here a couple of months back. Everything was fine until I asked for a diet soda. I was then informed that they only carry regular coke in a bottle. No fountain drinks?!?!?! Not coming back.,1
7426,"Congratulations Dave and Payton - delivering a concept Scottsdale has been thirsting for (pun intended).  We were there yesterday for lunch, during the unexpected downpour, and the place was packed. Everyone inside avoiding the rain and the vibe was great.  I can imagine how wonderful it is going to be sitting outside on a warm evening.  I'll be back for that.  
We ordered the fries, homemade pretzel, a regular beer brat with sauerkraut and the spicy brat.  The homemade pretzel is a standout.  Perfectly cooked - a yummy cloud of floury heaven with a chewy crust and the perfect amount of salt on top.  A very simple item but almost impossible to prepare perfectly and the Brat Haus did it. I paired it with the (non-alcoholic) ginger beer, which is a must try.  
Both the brats were great, served on a really fresh bun and presented on a cool tray with a small side of Payton's pickled cauliflower. Lots of sauces available on the table, which up the fun factor.  Curry Ketchup anyone?  The fries weren't as hot as I would have liked, but chalk that up to an incredibly busy kitchen trying to keep up with the demand on the opening week.    My only complaint? The flavors are so yummy and seductive, I wanted more!   More please.  And, next time, with the Nutella milkshake spiked with a dram of whiskey.     Thanks Brat Haus for delivering a fun and flavorful alternative to the oh,so boring wine bars!!",5
7427,"Found about this place while looking for Mother's Day deals and saw they were giving away a lemonade with purchase. I convinced one of my kids to go with me since the store would be closing soon and I wanted to try out this place especially after reading the Yelp reviews plus I'm a sucker for deals!  With just five minutes until closing time, I ordered and the staff was so nice and friendly. 

After getting my order, I can understand why it might be called ""Wow Wow Hawaiian Lemonade"" especially since it was my first time trying an Acai bowl and I picked the haupia bowl. My first Acai bowl and now I'm hooked!  The fruit was really fresh and the frozen Acai base combined with everything else just made it a delicious treat. The portions are so large that I saved half the next day since the rest of my family didn't want to share and it was just as good the next day. I also got the strawberry pineapple lemonade but planning on trying more flavors of both the lemonade and the bowls in the future.",5
7430,"We just stayed there this month and the customer service was horrible, especially Tim the escort. We were first told they couldn't find our reservations and didn't know if they had any sites available, what a joke, there were many empty sites. They blamed it on encore that they didn't know what was going on in the park. It's all about the dollar, we paid $90 to park in dirt and gravel. The first spot we were in was suppose to be pull through, couldn't even get in without unhooking the tow vehicle. This was our second and last stay!",1
7432,"The best thing about this place is how quickly it's all over.  I had been out of the Brazilian wax game for a few years, but decided to pick the habit back up.  My appointment with Molly lasted only about 10 minutes.  She was super friendly and very easy to talk to.  The price was $55, which seem to be $5-10 less than a lot of other places.  The receptionist was really nice too and struck up a conversation with me.  The only down side is that I live on the opposite side of town from this place, but they are opening a Spring Valley location soon!!!",5
7435,"Overpriced and a jumbled mess of odds and ends, from robots to baseball cards, to comic books. 
They have it, but I don't want it even at 1/2 the list price.
The guy working the counter is like, ""Can I help you with something?"" (with a look like I am about to steal something or who knows what!) Geeez!!",1
7438,"Was very pleasantly surprised to find this flagship Amex lounge, being an AA flyer I have always been disappointed that there was no Admirals club here as I fly through here 6 times or more a year. 

Very nice decor and free food and drinks.

With 5 free uses this year as a Platinum card holder I know I will use them up here,",5
7441,"I typically find movies based on real life events to be very boring but this was actually a really good movie. TL;DR version of the movie: Put a sticky note over your webcam, folks!!!!! 
Thanks, Evelyn for rushing all the way from Parkdale to give out Yelp swag! :)",5
7442,"This place is so reminiscent of a New York joint that I was having deja vu. The brick wall and the narrowness of the bar make me feel like I'm in a nice bar in Brooklyn. There is more space in the back by the wood burning oven but I actually liked sitting right next to the bar on the tables next to the brick. You can see where the mortar has crumbled away in the brick wall and where they've stuck a few wood chips to keep out the draft. 

Charming. The rustic outer surface is decked with various signs of Harley Davidson and Moosehead fame but still they have this almost posh vibe from hanging chandeliers and the beer tap backlight with several shiny gold tiles.

The mixed drinks are delicious and unique. The ""Hey Lucy"" specifically. I've never had alcohol soaked gummy bears before but OMG they're the most amazing things ever. Something about leaving those gummy bears in the bottom of your glass until the end makes the flavor just pop in your mouth. I'm tempted to try it at home. Very.

The food was also excellent. We had sweet potato fries which were served with some sort of aoli type sauce. The Grilled vegetable panini is delicious and I've never seen so many options to eat goat cheese (my obsession as per cheeses currently). The quatro formigiani? is a great flavorful pasta although its very heavy and thick with cream sauce.

If I could I'd go back here on a regular basis.",5
7443,"We came to Vegas in our RV and ended up staying a few days because of an engine problem. After picking up parts at the Cummins dealership I did a search for organic restaurants and found this place not far out of our way. It's in an industrial area and not that easy to spot...drove by the first time and had to turn around. Once inside this cozy little place we were pleasantly surprised! We have a lot of dietary preferences and rarely eat in restaurants.  We are also totally unfamiliar with Caribbean food! The owner was happy to answer all our questions as we deliberated over the menu options. The food was delicious with an interesting combination of seasonings. We especially enjoyed the cheesecake dessert!

Next time we pass through Vegas we will definitely stop in again....highly recommend this place!",5
7445,"This place is definitely five stars! I love the way their menu is organized and the philosophy behind their restaurant. All of the plates are made to share so as a party you can share twice the number of plates that you could get by yourself. A restaurant that encourages sharing? That's already a win in my book.

Moving on to the food. Everything I had here was amazing. We started with the duck fat fries which were absolutely heavenly. You would think that fries can only be so good but these are some of the best that I had. We had the duck liver agnolotti which was amazing as well. I'd highly recommend you share it amongst two people since after eating about 2 pieces it was definitely hard to handle. It was very rich and flavorful. Absolutely heavenly. The grilled octopus was decent. The flavor was great but I think the octopus may have been slightly overcooked.

For our main course we had an entree of seared scallops. They were cooked to perfection and the pork belly on the top definitely accentuated the flavor. I would highly recommend getting this dish. I have nothing to complain about. 

The service was amazing. Nothing much else to say about it. Waiters were all very friendly and attentive. All around just an amazing place. Will definitely be coming back!",5
7446,Have been going to this place for over five years and always so good.  Not the cheapest but good drinks and really good sushi.  Nice atmosphere and fun place to go.,5
7450,"Always hesitant to give a place five stars, but oh man, the food here is so good.

We had two of the specials: clams and cauliflower in cream sauce and bone marrow with caviar. Both were freakin delicious. The clams were fresh and perfectly cooked. The bone marrow was decadent. I wasn't sure I would like it with the caviar, but the flavors were perfect together.

Also had the foie gras (forgot which one, but it had maple syrup in it) and fries made with duck fat. Yum yum yum.

We figured that we should order the pied de cochon-- I mean, the restaurant is named for it, so it had to be good. It was. However, our eyes were bigger than our stomachs, and by the time we got the pig, we were stuffed. Stuffed. We had to get it wrapped up to go, and we ate it for lunch the next day. It kept very well! (note: the mashed potatoes that accompanied it were amazing.)

The service was OK. Our server was really warm and welcoming, and he really knew his stuff (and he was super handsome). But it was a pretty busy Saturday night, so it was difficult to catch his attention at times.

A few final things. Make reservations weeks in advance. The floor is slippery. I will definitely be back if I ever find myself in Montreal again.",5
7451,"The one star refers to Sales Associate, Michelle.  I requested alterations for an ankle length pant that was a bit too long.  Michelle was sent to the dressing rooms to assist with this and immediately projected a negative attitude and rude tone.  Instead of assisting politely and patiently to determine the length of the pant, she asked another customer if she needed help.  I had to wait for her to finish with the other customer.  She insisted that she couldn't assist with determining the length of the pant, due to my socks being on.  She did inform me that the pant came in a short length and that she'd have to make a call.  After making the call, she informed me that indeed the pants come in a short length, in all colors.  I stated that I wouldn't be able to try them on and she abruptly shouted ""they fit the same""!  When I voiced my concern with the manager, she informed me that they don't actually fit the same; the short length is a bit shorter in the rise.  Without saying a word about my thoughts of Michelle, my daughter said ""She's an angry elf"".  Michelle's tone and attitude was not the same with the other customer.  She showed her patience and a calm demeanor.  Maybe this Michelle is prejudice towards Japanese women.",1
7452,"I can't say enough about J2 Cleaning. They were incredibly responsive, and were able to schedule me within 48 hours; even offered to ""hop the sensor in the garage"" to ensure the house remained locked after their departure. The carpets were impeccable, after a year of a black Great Dane rolling and drooling all over, there was no sign anywhere that a pet had lived in the home. I will definitely be using them in the future, and cannot recommend them enough - I can't wait to see what they do with my cream sofa's which have been my dog's favorite for years.",5
7453,"I would give a zero if possible. Changed my contact prescription , immediately complained and when no solution offered requested a refund. 3 months later and still nothing.

7454,"Amazing place! I only recently discovered this coffee shop and I'm so glad I did! There aren't many cafes like this in Toronto. This one is very clean, the coffee is amazing quality, the pastries are fresh, and the presentation of the coffee is also very nice as they are served in unique coffee glasses. It's a pretty quiet cafe, so it's a nice place to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee; as well as people watch through the CLEAN, large window. 
There is also a nice little patio in the back, which they have decorated very nicely and tastefully. 
Thanks to the management for keeping this place so clean and enjoyable for their customers. Highly recommend this place!!!",5

7457,"Fantastic.  The steak burger is one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten in my life.  Perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned.  The pork shoulder sandwich could use a bit more sauce on it, but luckily, they provide you with four delicious sauces to add!  This is hands down the best restaurant I've eaten at in the city so far (3 years)!",5
7458,"These guys hooked it up. He had me ready to go and on schedule. His guys were great, responsive and considerate to my possessions. We packed 2 1/2.trucks front to back and handled it in one day. What a relief to have a competent moving company handle my move. Highly recommended!!",5
7459,"This is the absolute best Chinese Cuisine in the area.  Whether it is the pork, chicken, or beef, you can taste the freshness in every dish.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is quiet and peaceful.  It doesn't matter if you decide to dine in -- or you are driving by and decide to order a takeout -- or my favorite lazy way of preparing dinner -- delivery!!  Mmmm, every dish is freshly made.  The only negative comment I would make would be the price.  For a single meal, includes signature dish served w/ white rice, meals are $12-$22.  Other than that, excellent experience.",5
7462,"This was one of the better KBBQ places in Vegas. Wait was long(because there was a lot of people), though when seated and you get to dine, the food is delicious. For $21, you can choose from amongst 52 different items. I would recommend to anyone craving barbecue with a big appetite",5
7464,"I have used Daniel on numerous occasions.  He has repaired our garage doors, installed a new garage door, and installed a new opener for us.  He is easy to get a hold of and always on time.  His response time to come out is excellent.  I can always count on him.  He stands behind his work, is very knowledgeable in what he does and is reasonably priced.  I highly recommend this company.  You won't be disappointed.",5
7465,"Stayed in the Salon Suite in the tower suites area of Encore! It was an incredible experience. The room was huge, with a dining area, massage room, living room, bar area, large bedroom, and an amazing bathroom! 

The check-in desk was in a private and elegant area. We were served bottled water while we waited. An additional hotel rep came to greet us personally and we were given her business card if we needed anything during our stay.

Our room came with in-room breakfast every morning. At night we would call in our order from a pre-selected menu ( items such as French toast, oatmeal, omelet, eggs/bacon, croissant sandwich, etc), as well as coffee/tea.  In the evenings, we would get turndown service. Slippers were set out, the lights dimmed, chocolates next to the bed, and fresh bottles of water set next to the bed for us. It was wonderful!

During our stay, we used the salon (and barber shop) and spa, as well as the golf course, saw Le Reve. Every employee was wonderfully accommodating, and so polite. The hotel is so much quieter than the Wynn, and feels much more intimately classy. And it smells so good! I bought the scented oils sold in the Home Store so that I could experience it at home!

If you can't decide between the Encore and Wynn, you can't lose either way. I personally liked the Encore more, for the fact that it was quieter and more intimate. However, most of all the attractions (shows, golf course, shops, sports book, etc) are at the Wynn, so we did a lot of walking! The Wynn is just as beautiful, the rooms are large and gorgeous, and it is convenient to every want and need you may have.

But, if I had another choice, it would be Encore! Hope to see you soon!",5
7466,"Love this place!! It's peaceful and the drinks are inexpensive and delicious. The staff are super nice and are all knowledgeable about coffee and customer service. The outdoor patio is stunning and private, and the wifi reaches the whole patio. Whoh is very helpful. 

I enjoy that they sell beans and all forms of coffee. 
My only to go coffee place.",5
7467,"We all own cars and from time to time they need maintained and/or repaired. Sadly this is NOT the repair shop it once was. I recently contracted with this store to install rear struts on my Hyundai. Not a difficult job for a qualified mechanic. Well, I just had to replace one of the struts they installed because the mechanic stripped out the main shaft threads allowing the strut to rattle nonstop and somewhere allow the process snapped a bolt on the mount and tried to torch it out, unsuccessfully. Now, I've had to replace the new strut they assed up AND have to make another appointment with a different auto repair shop to fix their fuck up. Do not go here if you need anything more than an oil change or tires. I actually expect BOTH State Rd Monro's to close within the next year due to problems like this. 

Update- I played tag with Monro customer service since THEY reached out to me. Nothing has been resolved. Here is my email again so you can send me yours Brittany @ Monro. Feel free to send me an email and I'll send you a copy of the other repair shop invoice to fix Monro's mistake. 
jim@akron.usa.com
Don't call me before 4 pm. I am teacher and can't waste time trying to help you feel good about trying to help me. Either call after 4 or email me. Wasting my time isn't helping Monro's case.

Brittany, try this email. I've not received any email you've sent. So try this one.

7471,"You know it's bad when the mall's owners let the bank take it over.  Losing Macy's was a massive blow (and they owned that Robinsons-May building too, so no rent).  They've been struggling for a very long time now, but the surrounding area just isn't rebounding enough to support a regional mall.

I remember when they lured Best Buy from across the street (Borders was supposed to have the other floor, good thing they got Dicks instead) and several chain stores (Express, New York and Co) used the low rent to expand and remodel while the mall did a refresh (yanked out second floor carpet for tile).  So many storefronts are closed now.  It's really sad to remember how crazy busy this place used to be during the holidays!

There will never again be the plant-lined courts where Sam Goody and Music Land were built on top each other next to the well-stocked everyone-shops-here Sears, no overpriced but unique Suncoast across the ways, and no surprisingly good buffet at King's Table.  Wizards of the Coast, the music box and beanie baby shop, cookies and corn dogs and mozzarella sticks from the neon-lit Food Court...at least we have the memories.

Don't be surprised if you are asked for money by people in the parking lot or they try to sell you something.  AVOID the ridiculously rude survey people in front of Dillard's, if they're still there.",1
7472,"TL;DR: recommended for your Ramen itch. Broths are well crafty with balance and flavor in mind. Orders are done on order cards to the cooks. Relatively speedy deliver of Ramen to your mouth in about 6 minutes depending on the complexity of your orders. Won't hurt your piggy bank. 

Do you remember the first time you tore open a 10 cent pack of Ramen? Paying careful attention to pour the exact required of water to cook hopefully not just the noodles but also warm up the soup base to eat at an adequate temperature? Maybe cut up some spam and sauteing it so to give it a little char crunch, maybe even fried up an egg for extra protein. Well, this place is the more adult version of that. Instead of tearing up a pack of Ramen, you instead sit at the counter with other Ramen compatriots and place your orders through an order card so any mistakes is probably made by your hands. Literally. If you have any questions or need a recommendation, a cook is promptly ready by to answer your needs. A far cry from your youth but the smell, the sight, the taste, the textures, and the soup will bring it all back to you.

I had the chicken paitan which is the special for that evening. It's a thicker, creamier style chicken broth we're used to but it is hearty and meaty. In the broth you can smell the good quality bones, alliums, and aromatics. I elected for char siu for the extra protein. It was moist, slightly smokey from the braise, with an extra touch of burnt flavor from the blow torch they use to warm it up behind the counter. Nice generous size on the order of char siu. The crisp from the char portions of the meat is a welcoming addition. The green onions bring a refreshing pungent presence like your cousin Gary when he came out at your last family reunion. The ramen is surprisingly springy, think of al dente, and soft on the palate. It's really well balanced between the subtle flavor of the flour and Kansai.

All in all, the experience is speedy but not rushed. Affordable but doesn't leave you feeling you relapsed into the package style Ramen. I highly recommend this Ramen shop for its shop cooking ability and simplicity of which it delivers nostalgia albeit a little more ramped up and tastier.",5
7475,"Great cocktail list - and fun, delicious menu! The chicken pot pie nuggets are a must - and give the sliders a try too! Best of all, they serve some of the world's best spirits - including St. George Gin and their B&E Bourbon. The Pizzazzerac is an amazing cocktail! Before you leave, order the cereal milkshake - you will thank me. And then you'll go back the next day and ask for it all again!",5

My wife and I loved this place when it first opened and will be going back the next couple times we are in Vegas later this year. We love the guacamole (get tortillas with them) and the salsa along with many of the dishes both Chinese and Mexican. Make sure and make a reservation and enjoy the great food and margaritas.",5

The next 20 minutes I spend explaining him that hair should be smooth and that I cannot have random chunks of hair all over.  It just doesn't look normal... at which point I gave up. The 5 star review are a joke and I would not recommend this place to anybody!",1
7488,"Just got a letter from the Epic owner, Brent, which was very nice, and rather surprising. How often do you hear from owners of companies?? Brent addressed my concerns (viewable below) AND even sent us a $16 check to make up for our lack of a discount. 

It's very impressive that a company pays attention to its reviews (Yelp or otherwise) and tries to address those concerns. As I mentioned in my first review below, I would have definitely used Epic in the future, but after Brent's thoughtful and polite letter to us, I plan on using Epic sooner than I planned, and I have gone out of my way to mention this company to co-workers and friends. In fact, people haven't believed me that an OWNER of a company actually apologized, so I have to show them the letter. Excellent customer service!

And just to confirm: I honestly did not even have a problem with Epic cleaners when it came to the actual CLEANING. They did an absolutely fantastic job, with no up-sell, and they got the icky pet smell out of our carpet like pros. 

Epic is the antithesis of a shady company-- Brent truly cares about his customers and, even as a cynical city girl, I really appreciate Brent's dedication to his business and customers. There is absolutely no reason not to use Epic Carpet & Tile Care, and now that you know the owner truly cares about his customers, this should be the ONLY Carpet and Tile Care place you use!",5

I will never be returning. I'd rather drive 40 minutes to Scottsdale for Italian food.",1
7494,I've been coming here off and on since Drs. Howie and Joy opened their practice. Off and on not because of issues but because of insurance reasons.  They bring a whole new meaning to dentistry. I really don't know anybody that truly enjoys going  to the dentist. But they do a gentle touch technique that makes it very pleasant afterwards.  Dentistry has changed so much and the Drs and their staff are just great.   They really do take their time with you and take a conservative approach to their profession. They aren't quick to refer to oral surgeons or doing drastic procedures. They make great notes and look at the notes the next time to check for changes.  I love this. I've had dentists in years sat just want to jump in and go to extremes rather than taking a watchful eye to a situation. I highly recommend them if you're new to the area of looking for a new dentist to come to. Even my daughter doesn't fight me when I tell her she has an appointment.   It's a non event for her.,5

7500,"Our late Tuesday night order turned out to be an utter disappointment. We placed an online order (from the Regent St. location) at 1 15 AM and the expected time of delivery was 2 00 AM. We waited patiently until 2 15 AM but no pizzas arrived. I then called Topper's and we were told that we would receive our order in the next 15-20 mins since there was only one delivery person around (we were told we would get some 10-20% discount coupon as well). Having waited for an hour already we thought another 15 mins or so would be bearable. But the clock kept ticking and no pizza. I then called again at 2 50 PM asking them again about our order. I was then told that the Regent location does not deliver to my location. My location (on university avenue) is a 10 mins drive from Topper's and I've been ordering from them for years. So this was a bullshit response. I was then told that my delivery would be free and they would attempt to deliver ""soon"". Considering that it was already freakin' 3 AM, I wan't interested in the damn pizza any more. So I told them to them to cancel my order. They promptly did so with very minimal apologies.

Great new massage chairs.  Ask for Michelle or Tiffany.  The great thing is that the music isn't horrible (still going to be adult contemporary stuff but at least no Bolton) and the products are good.  They don't sit around and talk about you (always my annoyance at the nail salons) and the massages are great.  They also do brow waxes but I haven't tried that yet.  Parking is weird, there is plenty of it but virtually none in front.  They are speedy and efficient which is always nice.  Especially if you are in a rush.  The great thing too is that they have a tendency to stay late past their normal closing hours so if it's a true nail emergency you know you have a chance at getting in even if you're ten minutes after closing.",5

He even went out of the way to make sure one of ours was nut-free due to an allergy.

Jeff fixed our lock immediately and then turned his attention to the other lock on the door which we don't use because it hasn't worked in so long.  Jeff said it was bugging him and he wanted to fix it but wouldn't charge us.  He is a very nice, professional and reasonably priced. Don't even hesitate. Just call him!",5
7520,"I was meeting a friend for lunch in Kensington when he exclaimed, ""are you ready for the best taco of your life?!"" I replied ""oh seven lives right?"" thinking of the tacos I had enjoyed at that establishment before. The answer was a big fat no. Nope. Not seven lives. 
Off we went to a hidden little grill behind panchos. I instantly loved the two staff; adorably friendly and helpful. My friend told me the shrimp was his go to, but I fared for the carnitas and pork to see what they were all about. They make their salsas fresh and every day, out on display at the counter, so we loaded up and headed out to eat in the sun. 
I was absolutely blown away. 
Truly.
Having been to Mexico and LA and all over California loving the tacos I had eaten there, it takes a lot to impress me taco-wise. 
The meat was so tender and flavourful, the tortilla is crispy and double layered, not falling apart or dry like other places. They really stuff it too, none of those measly little portions at other spots in the city. 
I love the cilantro they added and the flavour of the medium and mild sauces. 
I'm one thousand percent showing these incredible tacos to my friends! 
Can't wait to try more items on the menu a million times over",5
7525,"Dr. Richards just did my breast revision surgery and they are so beautiful!
My first saline implants deflated 17 years ago, then I had silicone put in.
Here it is 17 years later and they were pretty old and a little uneven. I also breast fed my children.
This surgery made my breasts look better than the first one almost 20 years ago! I cannot believe it they are perfect for the first time ever! 
My breasts are magazine worthy!
Dr. Richards and his entire staff were so wonderful and caring!
He is such a gifted surgeon!
I can't say enough good things about him!",5
7527,"Courteous, attentive and responsive. Everything a person needs when an air conditioner goes out during a summer in Arizona! Keith, the owner, is a true professional. Call them today to service your current air conditioner or call them when you need someone you can trust.",5
7529,"Awesome coffee, delicious French sodas, and they've got some great fancier drink options. I love that they're local, and love even more that the service is very friendly and quick, plus their coffeeshop has lots of seating and tables to space out at. 

A definite added bonus is that their prices are very, very reasonable, and you can pick up their ground or whole bean coffees at nearly all the grocers in town. I'm especially a fan of their flavored coffees, which still taste like good coffee but also taste like their particular flavor. (A particular favorite of mine is the Oatmeal Cookie roast.)",5
7534,"Well first off, I'm glad to know I'm not the only one that has noticed what a dump this place has become. I used to love Baja Fresh and would come here probably once a week (this was probably 8-10 years ago) and it was great. I hadn't been here in probably at least 5 years until about mid July I decided to go for lunch. 1st red flag...THERE WAS NO AC INSIDE! It was probably 115 outside and 95 inside. They had 2 small portable units that didn't do a thing. According to OSHA and I'm sure health codes as well, THIS IS NOT OK! I got my food and tried to find a table to sit at but there weren't any clean tables. So I found the best I could find. 3rd red flag...As I was eating, the people sitting across from me at another table had a black widow spider crawling next to them that luckily they saw! I also notice the disgusting ceiling right above where I was sitting. I should have left the second I walked in. I actually wrote to the corporate office to let them know as well to see if anything gets fixed. I actually came back just last week to see if it had gotten any better...nope still no AC and everything just as before....I walked right back out.",1
7538,"After eating at Casa Don Juan, I will never waste my money eating Mexican food on the Las Vegas Strip or at a Casino again!!!!  Instead, I will Uber it to Casa Don Juan and have a outstanding Mexican meal.

I took my family to Casa Don Juan in July 2016, and we all loved our meal and experience.  

The restaurant is located about 1 mile from the Downtown Fremont street.  From the Strip is was a $6 Uber ride, and worth the ride.

The restaurant has a great old school decor and ambience.  There is a lot of Frida Kahlo pictures and art on the walls.

The service was fantastic, very friendly, professional and helpful.

After being seated you are given free chips, salsa and bean dip.  Something that you have to pay extra for at all the Mexican restaurants on the Strip.  The Chips and dips are very good.

The margaritas are large, delicious and you can tell they put a fair amount of tequila in the drinks.    The margaritas are about $10.

The food tasted delicious and fresh.  Everyone loved they way their meal tasted.  The portion size was perfect.  Enough to fill you up, but not make you sorry you ate the last bite.

The prices were very reasonable, especially when considering the quality and portion size.  You'll get so much more for your money, compared to restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip.  Our bill was about $75 for four dinners, 2 margaritas, and desert.

Next time I'm in Vegas, I will definitely be having dinner at Casa Don Juan.  I would also encourage all of my family and friends to enjoy this great restaurant.",5
7540,"Poke guys, as you can imagine, specializes in poke bowls, which basically is marinated raw fish, various combinations of toppings (e.g. kimchi, corn, avocado, salad, crab meat slaw etc etc etc) on top of a soft bed of rice. I've been here several times already and I've tired the Cali bowl, the PG's bowl, and the A Hui Hou bowl.  I haven't yet ventured into the create your own bowls yet but I'm? interested in trying that next time! So far all the ones I've tried have been delicious! My favorite so far is probably the Cali bowl! The fish is fresh the marinade is delicious, and all the toppings, even though it doesn't seem like they'd go together, surprisingly blends so nicely together! In addition, each bowl is $10.50 and it's a lot of food for that price! 
Yummy food, good value, I'm definitely gonna be back for more!",5
7543,"Hands down the best buffet in Las Vegas! Good quality food, clean, nice variety, friendly staff, delicious desserts, and most importantly alcohol INCLUDED. Seriously, no one can beat that for less that $16 bucks for lunch. It's a must stop for everyone who visits Las Vegas. Highly recommended.",5
7544,"This establishment offers an almost perfect ""tacos de la calle"" (street tacos) experience.

I tried their lengua (cow tongue), birria (marinated goat), and cabeza (cow cheek) tacos. All the meats and were prepared well and very tasty.

Do not be afraid to stop by, it may look a little rough, but they are serving some delicious fresh Mexican street food.",5
7545,"Why: 
1. Visited here for the first time for my birthday.
2. We live in a nearby neighborhood and knew about this restaurant via media coverage and word of mouth.
3. I love Braddock.
Who: 
1. Anyone who enjoys food would like this place.
2. People who want large portions and who aren't used to this style of dining could experience difficulty here (culture shock).
3. People who want high end food with a casual atmosphere will feel very comfortable here.
Highs:
1. Food was amazing.
2. Drinks were amazing.
3. The restaurant is beautiful on the inside.
4. The staff are lovely. Knowledgeable, friendly, and approachable.
5. We have probably never been treated so well at a restaurant.
Lows:
None.
Summary: Check it out! You will be glad you did.",5
7548,All I have to say is please check your food before leaving. I love smash burger and I am a regular to this location. I have to always check if they put bacon on the sin city burger because sometimes they forget. The past time was the worst. I ordered togo and when I got home I got a nasty surprise. The cook took off their glove and neglected to put it in the proper spot of the trash and left it in my wrapper. I did inform the manager and she was very polite about the situation and apologized. Just be aware that the kitchen staff is very forgetful.,1
7549,"Food was even better than what I expected , I was well done and service was amazing . Is a small location so it gets really packed quick. I will so recommend to come to this restaurant if you want to experience well done and authentic ramen.",5
7551,"LUCAS......Best Day Ever!! 09/12/17    Amazing....Everything was amazing from start to finish!! I can't say thank you enough to Lucas and the staff. Lucas was wonderful with taking care of all our wedding details!! Besides being a nervous bride everything else was taken care of.... Flowers were so beautiful, Courtney the photographer was great, food was delicious, our DJ Jason and our bartender were fantastic, cake looked way to good to eat but it was outstanding.The decor was exactly how we wanted it with little extra touches added made it a night to remember!! I would highly recommend this venue to everyone thinking about getting married here in Vegas!!! Thank you for making it our Best Day Ever-Kim and Chris",5
7552,"It took more than TWO hours for our meals to arrive (party of three) after we ordered. Friends of ours came more than an hour after we arrived and received their meals, and ate, before the server sheepishly admitted that they had a problem with our order. It was getting very late and she asked if we still wanted to eat, or just leave!! We stayed and the kitchen rushed our meals out. Imagine my surprise when the the owner offered to buy me another drink (WTF - he still charged us for our meals???) to make up for our inconvenience . We took the high road, paid our bill, and even left a generous tip. Deep down I knew this could very well be the last time I come back. The food is OK there, but customer service like that will lose you customers EVERY time. The Green Island turned into a giant Green Piece of S**T.",1
7554,"First place I went to go visit during my business trip to North Carolina. I had hoped to end it here as well, but I woke up late. I am actually writing this at CLT, sitting on one of them white rocking chairs. Man, as I am thinking about what to write for this place, my mouth is already salivating..

My girlfriend went to Florida for law school and told me that I HAD to go to one of these places. My goodness it was good. A great way to say: WELCOME TO THE SOUTH (I know NC is a debatable southern state, but this restaurant surely is).

I got the one with sausage biscuit, layered over by scrambled eggs and grits on the side. I never had grits before and it took some ""acquiring"" to do for me to enjoy it. BUT man the sausage biscuit with the scrambled eggs on top is something to DIEEEEE FORRRR! I don't think I need to do any explaining but, to say to go get it, and get fat, like a true Southerner.

Nothing up north has something like this. I want it now.",5
7556,What a GREAT auto repair shop!!!! The place is clean and the staff is friendly and willing to help.  I had my daughters Jeep towed in because her brakes went out. Matthew was very helpful and informative. He gave us a few different options and the repairs were done fast and affordable. My daughter said her Jeep has never run so well. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!,5
7557,I found this place of course with the help of yelp. This place is delicious. They have a variety of sauces to choose. The broth of the beef hot pot is so tasteful. And the chinese man is so nice. It's a must try!!!! I will def come back,5
7560,"just like the men's wearhouse i visited in San Fran, only better...  I needed to get a few suits for my new job.  the staff at this particular men's wearhouse was the most friendly and knowledgable staff I've ever had to deal with.  They were absolutely great and that store has now become my exclusive outfitter of clothes for all occasions.  I am not an easy size to find i am 6'7 320 pounds and the fact that they were able to take care of me in every way possible was amazing.  I also bought some stuff at one price and then got an email for a sale that made the things i bought even cheaper, they exchanged my stuff no questions asked so I ended up paying the cheaper price.  they tailored all my clothes and a few things didnt fit just right so they took care of it a second time for free. I just cannot say enough about how amazing this store was and how amazing the staff was as long as I live in the phoenix area I hope to have a long standing relationship with this store...",5
7564,"Few miles away from the busyness of the strip, this place is awesome!  Great service, great brew/beans, and great prices.  Lots of space and seating.  Unfortunately no cold brew if that's your thing. I will definitely come back whenever I'm in town.",5
7565,"Excellent and I am picky.  First and fore most their beef enchiladas are made with shredded beef, NOT taco meet.  5 stars for that!!!!  Ground beef tacos very large and not skimpy on the meat.  I really like the presentation as well.  Chips and salsa is free and also comes with guacamole and refried beans.  5+ stars for that as well.  Service was also fast and friendly and I highly recommend this place if you are eating beef options.",5
7566,Took my family tonight and we were highly impressed! Ice cream rolls were amazing! Fresh fruit was tasty. It was our first time and it will not be our last!!! They have a good selection of combinations or you can create your own. It's also strangely fun to watch them be made. We will be back soon!,5
7567,I have request an appointment on November 7th for November 9th. I have received an email stating that my request has been received and a representative will contact me shortly to schedule my appointment. As of today no one has called me. Looks like they don't need new customers.,1
7568,"Food was ok, drinks were good, but when I ordered a Mint Julep I was only poured about a third of a drink. Not like, ""less than a full drink to allow the ice to melt"", but a solid two or three sips worth. When I brought it up to my waitress she assured me ""that's how we pour 'em"", despite the fact that my three friends were later poured FULL glasses. Drink wasn't comped, wasn't offered an apology. Poorly handled. The two sips of julep were pretty good though.",1
7569,"This is one of those stores I never stop loving!  Handbags are my favorite and handbags from Coach are beautiful, stylish, and durable.  I can always find something that I don't want to leave without here.   

I usually get the additional 30% off coupon when I walk in, and that's on top of the sale price.  If they're not offering when you're there, just go back another time.  The employees are very friendly and helpful.  They're always happy to calculate the bottom line for me when I'm on the fence (which is necessary when they're offering a percentage off and giving you an additional 30% off on top of that... doing math in my head - not my thing).  

Try to go to this location on a weekday morning.  It's the only time I've ever to been able to shop without the hassle of bumping into someone every 2 feet.",5
7570,"Having to have had bad service this morning at another restaurant for breakfast, coming here for dinner with good friends made up for it. Service is great here and my main thing is that FRESH!, FRESH!, FRESH! Everything is fresh and even the sides are big portions as well. Rib eye steak on a hot grill. Hand rolls that has more fish then rice which is great! Every dish was good up to the end of our meal with desserts yum! The sushi chefs are very kind and sends out their specials if you're kind to them.",5
7571,"Yep. Mcallister was our server and absolutely killed it. They pulled up the smoker lid and showed us the goods....outstanding environment with a great patio, good low-level and upbeat music as we came in Friday around 2. I'll definitely be back with groups of people to show this place off. I can only imagine that's it's a well lit nighttime patio and can only get better. Foodwise??? Everything! And I really can say enough about the service.. For those that have been to the old oregano's in old town scottsdale, it's in that spot.",5
7572,Outstanding food and service. A friend recommended this place for lunch... So glad we went there salad and pics was delish.,5
7574,"I wish we could give zero stars because that is what they deserve. This company uses very aggressive and dishonest sales tactics to get people to buy points for a vacation rental. They don't tell you that the number of points required for a week's vacation will increase over time. We joined 8 years ago and were able to use the points for a one week vacation in Sedona. Now those points don't get a week. We now get a lower quality room for fewer days. The rooms are dirty, smelly, poorly located, and not upgraded. This past vacation, we had to change rooms three times before we could find one that was habitable but certainly not luxurious. The rooms that are renovated and have views are too expensive now and unavailable. When we bought the points I asked if inflation was possible and they lied to us telling us the points needed would never change. The other problem is that the good locations are never available any more. For example we can never find availability in Hawaii. It's impossible to sell the points once you've purchased them. We are stuck paying the constantly rising yearly maintenance fee until the day we die. Stay away from this company.",1
7575,"Amazing service! I totally recommend this place and the employees are the best!!!


Thank you so much!!!",5
7576,"Hallo Frau Lindenberger,


 vielen Dank f√ºr die schnelle und unkomplizierte L√∂sung! H√§tte nicht gedacht, dass es so etwas noch gibt  hei√üt doch immer Service-W√ºste Deutschland.

 Ps: meiner Frau hat's auch gefallen  genauso wie Sie es versprochen haben ;-D",5
7577,"This place was a complete waste of money! Service was horrible, we reserved for a party of 8 and they only had room for 6, you'll starve to death before they come take your order for food! Totally not worth the money! You're better off seeing your favorite comedian live when they are on tour and at a theater somewhere! I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy!",1
7578,Great great great. Gluten free and Celiac friendly. All favors tasted better than described.,5
7580,"Five star evening.  The service was excellent (it was Cali's first night there), staff was attentive and food was great.  Not as pricey as I expected, strongly recommend for a special event, or a cozy dinner.  Great tasty burgers and trout and salmon both given high marks.  Kudos to Stuart and his staff.",5
7581,"I needed to sell my Galaxy s6 after upgrading to s7.  I found this place on Yelp and called for an estimate.  Abe gave a great offer and he picked up the phone within 25 minutes.   I'm very satisfied,  A+ service!",5
7584,"My cousin had recommended me to go to Taz for Brazilian waxing. I've had nothing but negative experiences with other salons, so why not give this place a try right? 

It's a home salon, and located in the basement. It's currently under renovations, but I can already see that it will be a gorgeous salon! I arrived at 11:30am, and met the lovely Taz. She is a very very sweet woman, I instantly felt very comfortable with her. She reminds me of my own mama!! XD We began talking as she prepared me for the waxing. She could tell I was nervous. Usually it takes about 10-20 minutes for the aesthetician to wax, but took Taz only 6 minutes!! I was surprised at how fast, and gentle she was!! I was so so impressed, and was so happy. I was completely relaxed 3 minutes in, and it was already over 3 minutes after that. She is an amazing woman, she made sure I felt comfortable and relaxed, and it didn't hurt as much as it usually does! I'm so happy I met her, a sweet woman, with years of experience. It's probably the best waxing experience I ever had. Thank you so much again Taz!!",5
7587,Yup.. still exquisite memories of Le Cirque and I challenge anyone who gives this place less than 5 stars... show me somewhere better! Ha!,5
7589,"Eaten here plenty of times and would always have issues. Got wrong food, received wrong smoothie, ordered item without items and received with but the last issue was the most distributing and I will never eat here again. They always seem to be all over the place there. Ordered to go. Started eating my burrito and then realized I was chewing on a piece of rubber. Notified the store and they told me Manager was out and would leave message, said all they could offer me right then was a free meal next time I came in. Not only was I so disgusted that I was chewing on rubber they had no idea what it even came from and didn't even offer to remake my food. Also.. still waiting for the manager to call me back.. over 6 weeks later. Do not recommend this place. No customer service at all! 
Also, I paid $14 for a burrito that I ate one bite of before I chomped down on rubber.",1
7592,"Great Fish Fry! Try the Parmesan potatoes, you will not be disappointing. Very affordable fish fry, great atmosphere and service. We tried the pudding for desert which was also delicious! We will be returning and recommending our friends. There are two restaurants, but on Fridays both serve the fish fry. The bar doesn't take reservations and is first come first serve. Usually a 30 min wait, so grab a beer! If you don't want to wait jump over the house and there usually is seating available. We are hoping to experience the barn next time.",5
7593,"My poor Sheltie got the worst hair cut of his life at this place. I've taken him to their Craig location many times and he was fine but this place has done this to him twice. No longer bringing him here. I've attached a photo of what he normally looks like and what they did to him. They weren't even capable of giving him an even cut, to make matters worse. I had to put a shirt on him because he seems so sad now.",1
7595,"This place was so yummy !!! Fresh juice and ham were delicious, what else can you ask for! 
Ambience was nice, I did not have to wait to be seated. People were nice! I will be back!",5

7604,One of the best vape shops in Gastonia. The staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable. The prices are also great. They seem to truly value every customer they have and don't mind spending time chatting or informing you of what you need to know.  This will be the only shop I do business with from now on.,5
7606,"This is a great local joint. A killer happy hour and a great staff make this place tops. I recommend highly, don't forget your Beer Bites card!!!! Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!",5
7607,AmAZing breakfast.  Unreal sweet fresh donuts wow.  Arrive before closing and they'll toss you a few to try.   So so cool. Nice people.,5
7609,"I appreciate Costco because they're pretty standardized, tidy, and economical (duh). And, where better than in the good 'ole USA where we love to consume!!! Plus we're cheap bastards... All of us. It's true 'Merica.

I grew up on generic Costco brand (Kirkland) everything, and feel its still quality product. I bought pounds of frozen Mahi-Mahi filets that were around $15 but would have been twice that at Fry's. Damn, I'm winning at life!!

Plus, the hot spot sample kiosks are fun. All of the adorable retirees peddling their flavor of the days? Oh, and their Concession Stand (biting my knuckles)?!? Fab, quick food for pennies! Their chicken Caesar is pretty tasty! Coffee granita for a dollar-something is one of my faves also.

If you can bare the ppl with their KIDS everywhere and coughing out a lot of money (which is cheaper in the end per unit, do the math), then I say go full throttle. Watch out for that sun-scorched parking lot - it's quite a cluster!",5
7610,"Several rooms with birds free roaming around. What's not to like? I've seen one lady who got pooped on but I was lucky. They do have restrooms everywhere and paper towers by the entrances to each room for such occurrence. 
I wish they sold bird seeds so I can feed them and have them on my hand. But I can see that being a problem if visitors too eager to per the birds
Very entertaining place, especially for kids",5
7611,"I've been looking for a car since December, and when I came to Lexus I didn't feel worthy enough to look but I just said screw it and went. Best decision I could have made that day. Every place I went I felt like prey, seemed out by vultures ready to shove the first car I saw down my throat. Here it was the complete opposite. I looked with ease and was very comfortable. I walked up ready to test drive and Fran was the first person to greet me! She took care of me and got in a good vehicle for a great price and still continues to check on me! Even if that wasn't the car for me, I'd check their lot weekly until I found a vehicle. Don't ever want to go anywhere else!",5
7612,"I went here again with my bf for memorial weekend. WOW!! The food was great. Again, i love this place and i will always stop by here when i come to vegas. 

We ordered the yellowtail taquitos. If you guys do dine here, you should order this. I just love love it. You won't be disappointed. I don't think you'll be disappointed with their food period. I always get their peruvian corn. I just love it. We also ordered the duck and mushrooms. The last dishes that came at the end was their special that they had for sushi and bobo brazil seared kobe beef. I loved the special (sorry i forgot the name of it) verses the bobo brazil. 

Again this place is awesome. Thanks for the wonderful food.",5
7615,"Bubble tea wasn't great. Tapioca bubbles were tough to digest. Guy working there was training an older lady, which was fine, but you could tell he was a two faced spaz. Won't return.",1
7616,"We didn't even get to eat here becuase the host staff was so dismissive and rude when we went to eat breakfast. We arrived at 11 am and were militantly told breakfast ended at 10:45 by two people who were standing side by side reapeating everything each other were saying. I am not a dense person, I don't need two people telling me the same thing over and over again and then walking away from me before I can even take a look at the lunch menu. Do not come here asking for breakfast any later than 10:45 or you'll get ganged up on. Will not ever try to go here again. We ended up at Seabreeze Cafe, it was amazing so everything worked out for the best.",1
7620,"This place is terrible,  I called and made an appoinyment with specific guy and I was told that a student haicut was 20 dollars by the receptionist, the next day I came for my appointment,  the recptionsy said I never made an appointment,  and let a different barber cut my hair, he gave me a haircut wothout lining me up, he trimmmed roughly and left my hair uneven,  and once tje I was charged 23 dollars, I STRONGLY  RECCOMEND NOT GOING HERE",1

7623,"We ordered the six foot sub party tray containing three different sandwiches, three different breads and the fixings on the side. This was suppose to be our dinner during the super bowl half time. Some started eating when It was noticed there was mold on the bread. We immediately put everything back in the containers. I called Port of Subs but they never picked up(learned the next day that they closed early at 4 pm). We had to put together frozen food for our dinner as we would not eat moldy bread or food that came in contact with the mold. No one would go out to get food because we would miss the second half of the super bowl. I brought the food back the next morning and spoke with the manager, Jaime.  She apologized and told me that the owner does not allow her to give refunds. I was not coming back again so I told her to call the owner. This took quit a while. Finally the owner's wife gave her permission to refund my $54.13. I told her to have the owner call me. Two days later  after not hearing from the owner, I called the corporate office. I was told that  a field consultant would reach out to me. On February 13th the field consultant Gina called and listened to the situation about the mold on the bread. Gina  she would speak with the owner.  First of all, the workers should have noticed the mold on the top of the bread!  Secondly, the owner should care about his business and call if there is a problem!",1
7624,"I absolutely LOVEEEEEEE this place! It reminds me so much of home(NYC). The sights, the sounds, the smells, everything I legit just LOVE it here. All the vendors I've come across (I'm pretty sure it's all of them) are so nice and friendly. My most favorite place is Dionne's Meats, it's in the center, they have the most delicious assortment of wings and ready to cook meats! Makes dinner so easy for me. Between Asian food and middle eastern, to Italian and baked goods, it's heaven here! Most places are cash only so bring some along otherwise enjoy the vendors and the amazing fruit market right outside!!",5
7625,"STAY AWAY!!!  I would not eat here again.  I was in the neighborhood and thought I would try a new place for fish and chips.  Wow was that a mistake!  Place was not that clean and the staff was pretty rude.  Food was OK at best.  Fish and chips were super dry and when I went to complain to the ""manager"", she seemed more interested in what was going on with her phone than my problem.  Maybe there has been a change in management recently based on the decent reviews here.  Either way, I will never go back!",1
7628,"Boyfriend was craving Italian food, so I decided to go on a search on Yelp. We wanted somewhere close, but somewhere authentic too. Then we stumbled upon this glorious place.

I had spaghetti carbonara and my boyfriend had the linguini a la siciliana. There were ample clams and mussels in his pasta that left him satisfy. His pasta was full of flavor and simply amazing. My spaghetti carbonara had delicious cuts of prosciutto. Did I mention the plates were massive? They are beyond generous with their servings. I was in heaven.

Our wonderful server, Laura, was the sweetest thing on the planet. She was patient, funny, and gave us plenty of tips on their best meals. She suggested we get the #15 wine and it was one of the smoothest wines I've had. Thank you, Laura, for your kindness. 

For dessert, we had cannoli, which was unbelievable. 

A party was coming in who was celebrating their 50th anniversary - this is the place to do that, because the food and the hospitality is incredible.  

The individuals who work here - you are beautiful. Thank you for being welcoming and warm. Thank you for having a sense of humor.",5
7629,"Fantastic salon for men's haircuts. You can text to set up appointments, the staff will give you a drink while you wait, and everyone is very friendly and professional. Ask for Lindsey, one of the best haircuts I've had.",5
7630,"Her Glory beauty supply is an amazing business! The owners are super knowledgable about the products and know what's best for you. From the moment you walk in til the moment you leave, you will experience great customer service and nice clean music :) I will be coming back!",5
7632,"Grilled turkey club is one of the best in the valley! Service excellent, as well.",5
7635,"What a great service!!! Todd is very friendly, the vehicle was clean and had adult beverages on board. My final destination always a little ways from the airport, I am traveling alone and was leery of just taking a cab. From the minute I made my reservation on line I knew I was in good hands and didn't need to worry about a thing. Everything was super easy, from online booking to not having to handle my super heavy bag. Thank you Todd.",5
7637,"I'm surprised this location gets any stars. They never have my order-on-the-go ready when I go there to pick it up. Wish they would spend more time remembering coffee orders as they do thinking up their next tattoo. There's someone new working there every time I dare (and I mean dare) to go in and that's saying something... even management changes like dirty towels. The last time I went in it took 2 people to make my decaf iced coffee w/a turbo shot... 2 people! The guy who took the order had to hand it off to someone else halfway through. The guy who had the order handed off to him was noticeably upset by the act, but at least the first guy knew his limits - apparently taking orders and making coffee. This location is abysmal.",1
7639,Awesome customer service! They also supplemental protein and other products besides the delicious smoothies they serve!,5
7641,"What a sh-thole. Before I go into detail, let it be known that I hate Entertainment District nightlife. The crowds are douchey, cover is too expensive, and the music is usually Top 40 crap. If you frequent Entertainment District clubs, disregard my review, because you deserve this.

I came here for a friend's birthday on a Friday, and it was advertised that cover was free for ladies/$15 for guys before midnight and that there would be three floors. We got there around 11:30 and a bouncer told us cover was $20 for everyone. I let him know that we were told otherwise, and he said ""Well, you can either pay $20 or get out of line."" I shut up ONLY because it was my friend's birthday and I didn't want to mess up his plans.

We paid the bullsh-t $20 cover charge, got in to find out that only one of the three floors was open, drank away our pain, and danced to crappy urban music. The end.",1
7642,I've been here twice now. Great food every time. Everything I have tried has been awesome. I am not a huge fan of the line style ordering but the place is cool and has cool decor. I will be back.,5
7644,"I love Arsenal. Every time I'm in Pittsburgh, I make sure to stop in and refill my growler. Even bought a second one this time around! I stopped in last Sunday and they had Kelly's Concord as a slush... that may have just been the greatest thing I've ever tasted. My favorites are the Fighting Elleck, Negley's Nectar and Archibald's Ado. I already can't wait to go back!",5
7647,"I agree with the 1 star review.

More points
- they never answer the phone
- I had to wait around 30 minutes for my initial visit
- the receptionist was rude in person",1
7648,"Absolutely as good as it gets. I've been training with Dave for a few months now and the results have been phenomenal. The 1:1 attention has helped me lose weight and get in shape faster than anticipated. Great guy, great gym. I highly recommend catalyst!",5
7653,I don't know why someone would be rude to someone with a legit allergy. But that's what happened when I went there with a friend. Sorry not sorry. The Asian man that works there should really learn some customer service skills. There is no reason to be rude to anyone when they are trying to make sure the strain they purchase won't close their throat. Ill be taking my business elsewhere. Learn not to be rude. This is me being nice. I could say worse.,1
7654,"Carm's Cafe is a hidden gem in Concord. I randomly found the place while visiting Concord's amazing antique gift shops. The sandwiches my girlfriend and I ordered were amazing. So amazing that we brought friends back up to Concord with the intent of having lunch there. Once again, the same great quality and great price. 

The store itself is very relaxed. Sit where you want, refill your drink yourself at the machine, etc.

If you live in Uptown Charlotte or above I highly recommend making the drive up to Concord to dine here.",5
7655,"I have one thing to say and it says it all. Every positive review you have read is absolutely true. Period. If you are reading this because you are looking for an amazing Dr for your pet, go no further. You just found him. I have never, and I mean never, seen a veterinarian have such an incredible way with my animals like Dr B. If he was a human Dr he could get your kids to eat their vegetables and clean their room. He gives me the peace of mind knowing that my very loved 4 legged children are in good hands. I just moved to Phoenix and I'm very thankful I found my cat's forever Dr.",5
7657,"Very good restaurant offering a variety of tasteful and fresh vegetarian and non vegetarian foods. I had the kale and pinto bean soup, the chicken salad sandwich , steak tacos, sweet potato and black bean tacos,  sweet potato fries, broccoli a blonde brownie and a chocolate chip muffin. I actually shared this with my friend. :) The restaurant was very clean and the prices are very reasonable. Enjoy!",5

7660,Good service and great tacos not here often but when I am I come to this place for happy hour!,5
7662,All I can say is that GC Glass is fabulous.   From start to finish they were courteous/efficent/ and reasonable.   I could not have asked for a more rewarding experience.  I would recommend them to everyone.  The tech especially Carlos was so through and professional.  Carlos did an amazing job and he was quick very polite.  My overall experience on a range from 1 - 10th is definitely a 10 plus.  Thank you so much GC Glass,5
7663,This place was absolutely perfect!!! Started off with lemon chicken salad and it was so delicious. And I don't even like salads!! The burger was so juicy and perfectly cooked!!! The bun was pretty tasty itself. The flat bread was to die for! I will totally go there again in a heartbeat!!! I highly recommend this restaurant!! You won't be disappointed!,5
7664,"Beyond the fact that these people are scam artists I'll review my entire experience at this place in case the fact that they're handing out stock images isn't enough. Regardless of if you believe it's an honest mistake or not they obviously don't know how to do their job if they can ""touch up"" and print the same photo this many times without noticing.

It was very clear that the woman providing the ultrasound had absolutely no idea what she was doing. She was regularly scanning over my hip bone and kept shaking and (lightly) hitting my belly.  The majority of the ultrasound was in 2d, once she finally flipped into 3d I was so disappointed, it was so blurry and difficult to see anything, she had to point everything out to me and I had to take her word for it on what I was seeing.  She reassured me that the pictures would be clearer once printed, I was skeptical but who am I to question? I was asked to wait in the waiting room a few minutes, when she emerged she gave me 2 clear photos, I was so impressed that she was so capable of touching up these photos so well! Well turns out I have 2 of the stock photos.    I would strictly give this place a bad review based just on the blurry ultrasound video, the fact that I know 5 women right now who got the wrong gender and that she handled my belly so roughly during the ultrasound.  

I have since gone for another 3d ultrasound elsewhere and saw her take screenshots at the time of the ultrasound, those were the pictures I actually received, what I saw on the screen was what I got and when baby was in the wrong position I was asked to roll over, no one touched my belly without permission.",1
7665,First time visit to Downtown Salon Phoenix. I had no particular hairdresser in mind and called in for an appointment. The hair gods were good to me that day and my appointment was with KELLEY.  She is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!  She spent some time talking with me about what would work or wouldn't work with my hair type and offered suggestions. I got a haircut and coloring done. There must be magic in her shears. I walked in feeling meh... walked out feeling confident and beautiful. A big plus for me is that they're also open on Sundays.  KELLEY!  KELLEY!  KELLEY!  I can't help but shout her name out.,5
7667,"This place WAS the best dive bar in phoenix now it's just ok... if it's not broken, don't fix it.",1
7668,"I received the Swedish full body massage and facial. It was absolutely amazing! Both Sonja and Linda are wonderfully sweet. All the products are organic and vegan. The music and overall vibe of the office is great! Every relaxing; you leave feeling refreshed. The facial left my skin feeling clean and soft, and looks amazing. I cannot wait to go back!!",5
7669,"We picked up a to-go order. So good! Love their potstickers! Nice thin skins, NOT thick and doughy like most restaurants. Szechuan spicy eggplant was really tasty, good level of heat. Vegetables with garlic sauce was crisp and fresh. Moo Shu pork was really good too. We'll be back!",5
7670,"I'm owner of Lunchtimecafe and I can't tell you how many surgeries I've had and injuries, however I was in terrible pain for a month with a locked up lower back so I decided to try this doctor because he came highly recommended and I was not disappointed. I waked out of there less then 20 minutes feeling like a new man.",5

7678,"This is a neat little coffee shop in the carpet district, literally right beside the shoeless Joe's,  this place used to be a hair salon Called Redd, it is now the home to this neat indy coffee shop called Louie, named after one of the owners's dog. Jo, one of the owners, boasts years of experience in the bean and tea industry, yet still has the passion of a green bean. What's super cool is that most of the store's renovation, including the long wooden bench with gas pipe stand just outside the stores east walls, are all hand made, mostly by Jo's father.",5
7679,"Horrible. I moved 24.3 miles away and tried to cancel my membership and get a refund for the remaining months (I was not going to drive 45 minutes to work out) I spent $400 some dollars for a year. The manager was a douche bag on several occasions. On my second day there, I forgot my temporary gym id, and my info wasn't in their computers yet, the manager got extremely agitated and threatened to make me leave and get my id card. Absolutely ridiculous.",1
7681,"I was on a business trip in Vegas and craving some good Chinese food. This restaurant is literally just a $12 Uber away from the far end of the strip (Mandalay), and totally worth it. Small hole in the wall, but clean, popular, and great customer service. 

Two thumbs up from this Asian! Their beef noodle stew was my go-to and reminiscent of my mom's (albeit way more spicy!).",5
7682,"I love this place
We eat here fairly often. I am a big fan of the spring rolls, the vermicelli and the rice roll  grilled pork. (r05 on their menu). My only complaint is that the person who does the rice paper steam rolls does not work about 50% of the time and we LOVE these so it is a bit of a disappointment when they are not available.

Delivery is fast and so is take-out. They seem to do more take out than dine-in so the place is generally fairly empty inside (which I prefer). I have always gotten friendly service here.
I don't like cold rolls so I can't comment on them but my boyfriend had the chicken curry and it was also quite good.",5
7683,"Service was not good. The waiter (Ariel) asked me for my ID (which I'm always flattered to hear) and as I go to my purse to get it he says ""I'm not kidding"". That was a bit uncomfortable considering I didn't think he was joking. I ordered shrimp tacos with flour tortillas because I do not like corn and I still got corn. He could not remember our drink order and came over 3 times instead of just writing it down. The drinks were strong but not good. The food was not worth the price. I would much rather go to Abuelo's where we are never disappointed. I would not recommend this place. My family and I will not be returning.",1
7685,"We have brought our dog here 4 times in the past to be groomed.  

Every single time, there was always a confusion on how much their services should be as they could not decide if our dog should be charged for the larger dog or smaller dog.  She's a regular cockapoo size.  

We always had to have the same discussion every time we went there.  It was getting a little uncomfortable on the 4th (and final) time as we didn't want to look like hagglers, although we were made to feel that way.  

It wasn't our fault that they kept getting their prices confused.  The owner and the groomer would always have to argue about it.

I rarely ever give a 1 star review but this place deserves it.",1
7687,Just had my car detailed this morning... They do a great job. Even though my car is older they still pay attention to detail and make everything as shiny and new as they can ;) very nice friendly guys too. I would definitely recommend,5
7688,"Your were funny, but I promise I never never watch any of your shows. I believe that someone that makes the President of United States of America a joke and can't respect him doesn't deserve my attention, I will think that you rather place a CRIMINAL LIKE HITLARY in the white house but narrow mind that doesn't allow to see who will be better for the country, she is a criminal and everyone knows.",1
7689,"Everytime we go downtown we stop here for lunch or diner.  Love the clams and linguinni and the lasagna, just like grandma used to make!",5
7693,"Local food from local farms, at its best. Staff is friendly and very accommodating. But the people that hang out here always look pale and grey. Can't win everything I guess.",5
7694,"AMAZING EXPERIENCE!! 

My server, Jennifer, was such a delight. She had great energy and truly showed her love for the restaurant and what it has to offer. She was extremely nice and accommodating. My mom and I shared 2 meals, which they split for us.. we weren't thrilled with the Thai Chicken Salad on the light menu.. and they took it back without us even asking and replaced our dish with something else... AN AMAZING BUTTER CAKE FOR DESSERT!! OMG. YUM.

Brooke was our expo, she is AMAZING as well. So fun and energetic.. bubbly and very knowledgeable. Her and Jennifer worked very well as a team making sure we received the correct dishes and drinks.. 

The restaurant is so cool.. very clean and homey feeling. LOVED it. Will absolutely be back! :)",5
7697,Um good .com .org .net! The meat is really flaky (that's a good thing) so get a double of whatever you get! The shoe lace fries are really good and you get a lot. Customer service is top notch too!,5
7698,The food here is awesome and authentic. My favorite here is the cilantro ribeye. If you're ever in Las Vegas I would highly recommend trying this restaurant.,5
7699,"This was my first visit to any of Thomas Keller's restaurants and I can't wait to try the others. We had to catch a show so we ate an early dinner right when they opened at 5pm. It seems like a lot of people also go here from brunch, so I can't wait to try that next time! 

He ordered the special artichoke appetizer and the chicken. 
The artichoke hearts were lightly breaded and fried. The batter was very light and was not oily at all. There was a pimentel aioli to dip and tiny slivers of olives as well. The watercress on the top was a nice touch too. 

The chicken was probably the best roast chicken we've ever had. The skin was crispy and the meat was extremely juicy. The jus was so flavorful and I could not resist dipping my bread into it! The server informed us that the chicken was in a brine and then left to rest for 24 hours before being roasted. It was served over 

Having eaten a late lunch only a couple hours before, I ordered the house salad and the special crab appetizer (so adventurous, I know). I wish I ordered more, but did not want to feel the guilt of wasting food that took so long and so much care to prepare. 

The house salad was full of fresh mixed greens, topped with a round of herb goat cheese, and tossed with a red wine vinaigrette with shallots. It was amazingly light and very generously portioned. 

The crab appetizer was a cold platter with a large claw and leg. It was served with lemon and 3 sauces, 2 of which we were sure were the same. They tasted almost exactly the same. One was a mustard and the other was your typical marinara sauce. 

The dessert was the absolute best part of the meal. It was the special of the day. The bottom layer was Thomas Keller's own ""oreo cookie"", topped with a mint-infused bavarian cream full of chocolate crunch balls. Then there was some sort of sponge-like layer over the whole thing. It was to die for. There was a mint streak on the plate and a double chocolate ice cream as well. This was a euphoric moment to have this with a cup of strong black coffee.",5
7700,"THIS PLACE WAS AWESOME. Definitely going back soon and will be trying something new. I got the tempera temptest and it was very good and fresh. The service was quick and friendly, highly recommend.",5
7708,Loved this place. Amazing ambience and decor. Beautiful Victorian house. Awesome service and the food looked spectacular and tasted great. Would go back in a heartbeat. Fairly long wait but reasonable for a Saturday night. Were treated with appetizers while we waited. Amazing. Nice beer selection as well. Can't fault them for anything.,5
7709,"My wife and I love eating here! This is hands down our favorite restaurant. From vegan to full on carnivore and everything in between. Usually people say what food they like at a place. But here everything we have eaten has been stellar. High quality, well made, affordable and great service. This place is just over an hour from where we live and we make the drive past hundreds of other restaurants. Maybe you won't feel the same passion for the place, but you will have a great meal.",5
7710,"As an out-of-towner, I stumbled across Bachi Burger on Yelp. It was the morning I was leaving town, and about an hour and a half away from Vegas I realized I had left my phone at the restaurant. I called and spoke with the manager, Paul, and he immediately offered to mail it back to me. He was extremely friendly and very accommodating. When I asked what I could do in return, his response was to just ""pay it forward for someone else"". 

Delicious food, very cute location, and amazing service! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great sit-down meal in Vegas!",5
7711,"I been here a few times I wish the meat was halal could of eaten it then. But tried the fish and other vegetables; everything was awesome didn't have any problems. The green tea ice cream was amazing , had so much. I will come back for more  great experience!!!!",5
7713,"Great company! I was stuck on the side of a busy road in East Liberty for 3 hours waiting for AAA. Finally I called MSV on my own. They were there within 20 minutes. Brian, was so polite and knowledgeable. He even followed me across the street and put air in my tire. THANK YOU!!!",5
7715,"This place is the real deal. Great service and atmosphere. I first went here about 6-months ago while I was in LV for business. Huge selection of IPAs and wine --- I knocked down a couple of the Imperial IPAs and at 8.9% alcohol, they took the edge off after a long day, haha. 

Menu is loaded with every type of pizza and Italian dish --- Chicago style, New York, thin crust, gluten free, etc. etc. etc. --- it took me forever to decide but I finally settled on the Carne Totiro and was absolutely delicious. 

I went back with a few buddies last month and we were not disappointed. We ordered one of their larger pies, loaded with meat and veggies and we couldn't finish. Great way to start the night!

If you're in DTLV and you're looking for a solid place to eat, drink, watch sports and people watch --- Pizza Rock is an awesome option. I do not travel to LV often but I will definitely make it a point to hit this place up again when I back in the city.",5
7717,"I needed three pairs of dress slacks hemmed in two hours.  I was in and out in less than 10 minutes for sizing.  

Sure enough, two hours later they were ready.  And they did a great job!

7718,"Grown up hot pockets! What's not to love?! The restaurant had a cool vibe and atmosphere. The service wasn't bad. They were out of the chilled bean dip we tried to order, though. The pasties were quite tasty - it was our first time trying them, and we were impressed.",5
7719,"The security guards attacked my cousin and left him unconscious. They caught him with a flask and when they asked him to leave. Being a sweet guy that he is, he was completely compliant.  My family and I saw them drag him to the elevator and choke him till the point of unconsciousness.  We will never forget his face. It was so traumatizing! Please, do not go to marquee! It is not safe! This happened to us and it can happen to anybody else. This place is DANGEROUS",1
7720,"My boyfriend and I came here a few days ago for our 1 year! I had no idea what to expect but good lord was I in for a treat. Our server was Nate and he was extremely knowledgeable in all of the steaks and different types of wine. WELL WORTH THE PRICE! I've never had better steak. We ordered sides of artichoke and Brussel sprouts and both were also to die for. Our waiter knew we were celebrating and gave us complimentary sauces for our steaks and a desert where they wrote ""Happy Anniversary""! (Ps- their butter cake is legitimately the best thing you will ever put in your mouth). At one point the owner came by our table (at least I think it was the owner or at least a manager) to make sure our meal was ok and we couldn't praise enough. So thanks Arrowhead Grill and Nate for making our night so wonderful! We tried to track down the guy who stopped by our table to sing praises on our server and couldn't find him so I hope this reaches someone. I recommend this place to anyone and everyone wanting to splurge on a romantic and delicious meal.",5
7722,This place takes the typical pub food but takes it to culinary genious. The pretzels and fondue are amazing. All the food is pretty good and the prices are what you would expect for a higher class establishment. Valet parking is free which is a nice perk. They also have games inside. Come on down and enjoy where the hipsters hangout. They know good food when they see it.,5
7724,"I don't usually take the time to write reviews but I couldn't be happier with the service that these guys provided, so I'm making an extra effort to write this review. If you own a BMW like me the first thing you are overly worried about is, how much is it going to cost to fix after the warranty runs out! Well my warranty ran out and I had a problem... I'm incredibly happy to have found SW Bimmers. After recently having a suspension problem that was not a very apparent fix they spent the time to diagnosis the real problem before just changing out a bunch of parts, they replaced my rear spring and my car was back in order. I have found SW Bimmers to be honest, experienced and provided me with a great service experience. I highly recommend them to anyone needing BMW service and repairs in Las Vegas. And I agree with everyone else who has written reviews here, I'm never going back to Desert BMW again!!!",5
7725,"Horrible service!  Thank God AHS assigned me another company!  Argued with me about a leak and claimed they fixed it.  I paid for over 5 lbs of refrigerant to refill my unit .   A few months later my ac stops working again.  They sent out French who came with an attitude.  All the refrigerant gone out of my unit again. 
A & R Complete Service Corp  is probably the least professional company in town if you need HVAC.REFRIGERATION is the worst  service  experience . According to French  the  Senior Tecnitian  that was assigned   He verified previous techs diagnosis. All and all we had five different visits for the same unit . This last visit he was offensively impolite and one of the worst  and negative experiences I had with any company.  I would never recommend this company .",1
7727,"When I really, REALLY, need coffee and I'm able to get away for a short stroll, Clockwork Coffee is a go-to. Having tried the pour overs, the cortado, and the lattes, suffice to say... I'm a real fan. Strong coffee, tons of flavorful nuances, awesomely knowledgeable & friendly baristas! A+++.

You can order their pour over via Ritual to avoid the wait. Though, if you're here for a bit, there's shared seating with two other cool establishments: Rose City and Smash Juice Bar.",5
7728,"Let it be known this review has nothing to do with the personelle at this place - they were all great and were the only reason we stayed there for the few moments we did.

However, if the very basic requirements for any establishment housing people are not met - we have a serious problem.

Our ""Pyramid Deluxe"" room was moist, musky and upon further inspection riddled with Black Mold. Didn't find that out though until the morning after we stayed, when both my fianc√©e and I woke up sweaty, dizzy and nautious.

Sure they comped the resort fees and Hotels.com refunded the entire stay - but I would have honestly paid any sum of money to leave that place as soon as humanly possible. 

I have no idea about the quality of the other rooms, or if the Luxury Suite they offered us is any better. All I know is that if anywhere in this day and age knowingly allows these types of conditions to exist, and worse allows people to sleep there with their loved ones?! - than they are setting a dangerous precedent for an utter lack of regard for human safety. 

I won't step foot near this place again, EVER...and would advise you all to do the same.",1
7730,"I don't usually rate clubs.  Same reason I don't usually allow photos after a certain hour or certain number of drinks.  But this place, wow.  If you want to live like a rock star, this is the spot.

I won't tell stories, but yeah, a good spot well worth going.  Go big or go home, c'mon, you're in Vegas!

I read  bunch of other reviews of this place, so just a quick note for anyone not ""getting it"".  You get what you pay for.  I didn't wait more than 4 minutes to get in.  Treated like a celebrity, and surrounded by some by the way. This place rocked.",5
7731,This studio is amazing! My best friend and I went to David to have some script work done. He was amazing and did an outstanding job! This place was affordable and there was no bs. We will be back in the future to have more work done!,5

7739,Nato's came highly recommended from a few friends. I can tell you I could not have been happier with the service I received. He came out for two different things within a week. Completely satisfied with the outcome of both fixes. Owner/operator of this small business and he made sure it was right before he left. Have already passed his name along to a few different people. Please keep him in mind for you plumbing fixes.,5
7744,I've been coming here since thy opened. My nails have never looked so good. These are my natural nails. If you haven't tri d the SNS/healthy nails I highly suggest it. Ask for Lily. She is fast and does an amazing job!  But this place gets busy so definitely make an appointment.,5
7746,"I like this place. Comfy place to lounge. Cool seating. Good hookah. Good prices. Free wifi. The only downside is that there is no food but they do allow you to bring food in.

I find it to be a nice spot to bring my laptop and work.",5
7747,"Wow, I was not expecting such good food in Vegas! We ordered a lot of food and everything was great.  The Bolani was very tasty and my husband loved the qabili palao. I loved the eggplant! Will definitely go back next time we're here!",5
7748,"We're been patronizing this establishment for a few decades.  We have never, not even once had a bad meal here.
Service is the best service anywhere ever!  Quality, quantity, quality!  It's all about fresh and abundant portions.  An array of flavourful options of rare to find authentic Mexican restaurant.  Huge facility partitioned into 3 festive fun dinning halls, large bar, and even though we arrived early tonight to get a great table for 8, the place was packed....it always is!  It's a sure bet to eat here when you've hunger pangs for rich delicious succulent Mexican fish, meats, chicken, shrimp, and vegetarian options too!
We've brought hundreds of guests here over the years, from clients to family/friends.  Nobody ever complained about anything........ ever! This is the very very best!  Vegas can be proud of this icon.",5
7749,"Atmosphere:
Great place to go with your friends.
Customer Service:
Great staff, I don't know if it's a hipster thing but all their staff are younger and super positive, seems like the type of place I would love to work at.
Food: I love the Sunday Sundae! I guess they change it up every week and honestly the presentation of all their dishes are awesome! Also you have a choice to go healthy or not so healthy so it's a great place to go if you have a vegetarian or vegan friend cause they have a lot of vegetarian dishes and for the most part you can modify a dish to make it vegetarian.
Price: For the quality and amount of food that you receive it's inexpensive.
Overall Experience:
Overall awesome! Great job guys! Few places I can say this about but I could actually eat at SkinnyFATS every meal of the day every day.",5
7750,"What I really don't like about living in this place is that whenever I go to office and ask maintenance to do some work into my apartment the front office have always said that they will put in a work order and that they will be coming by tomorrow or the next day... But guess what?? That work order I put in was about 7 months ago when we moved in here and yet the only thing maintenance have done was take out my screens n checked out my dryer and that was it and they said that they will come back tomorrow because they didn't have any screens on them.. So that was 7 months ago and yet none of the work orders I've put in still haven't gotten done whatsoever and this was the first day I moved in which was in July... Now it's February and yet still nothing... I actually just gave up on maintenance around here so I basically started doing every maintenance my damn self and said screw the staff here... But what pissed me off most about was.. When my neighbor moved in they automatically have maintenance fixing everything in their place and yet I was just like ""wtf dude what happened to them coming here??"" But oh well we're moving out anyway once the contract ends so I don't have to deal with the constant empty promises given by the front office staff...",1
7751,I'm a guy and I usually go to barber shops but now I upgraded myself to going to Evoke Salon. First off the staff are all great and very friendly. It doesn't feel like a stushy hair salon. It feels like I'm going to a relaxed environment. They offered me water or juice upon entrance which was a surprise to me. They are even on Twitter at @EvokeSalon and offer specials too online so they are web friendly too which i like! I highly recommend them for a great experience.,5
7752,Though I've eaten many tacos in my life- I had never REALLY had tacos until yesterday!  I want more!,5
7753,"Good times to be had!! I saw my first ever live UFC event here.  The venue was pretty nice....easily accessible. I hate venues that don't have enough entrances/exits....but Mandalay is well laid out. I swear, there's not a bad seat in the place. We had the up top section - and since Mandalay is not that big (compared to arenas like Honda Center and Staples) you still get a great view. I could hear the leg kicks and smell the sweat from our seats. NICE! Seating was not overly cramped, either, like you might expect from a smaller venue.  Ahhhh.....good times for sure.",5
7755,"Ok, here I go again...this is a fantastic place! Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful service. Seriously, they are all so nice in here. And the food...so fresh and so amazing. Portions are the right size and healthy! I have had the grilled chicken energy bowl - it was great, seasoned chicken and vegetables. The 5K salad - this is truly an amazing salad. I can't do it justice with my words, just go try it...now! And, the flatbread chicken avocado melt - um, YUMMY! The Hybrid Punch is really tasty too. Sometimes the wait can be a bit long so do yourself a favor and order ahead if you are on a lunch break. But, do not EVER let that stop you from coming here! Prices are a bit more than you are going to pay at some places but, hands down - it is worth it! When you want really good food that is good for you...go here!",5
7756,During my weekend stay at the Phoenician I decided to get my nails fixed before I fly back to Germany. I just had a great treatment from Rachel. Now I have happy nails!,5
7757,"Was here for a business meeting in their private dining room. Dinner was a prix fixe menu however it could not have been any better. 
Started off with the ceaser salad which was dressed perfectly with a large crunchy parmesan crouton crisp. Exactly how I like it. 
Main course was the filet. Cooked to absolute perfection. It was so tender I could almost cut my steak with a fork. Normally thick filets come out tough or a touch dry, not this one. It was so mouthwateringly good that I polished off the whole thing.
Sides: Cream of corn is a win and the mushrooms with caramelized onions had an awesome flavor. Not bland like what I imagined saut√©ed mushrooms would taste like.
Desserts was a tray of mini samplings of cheesecake bites, carrot cupcake, and what appeared to be a peanut butter cup. Let's just say I had one of eat and I wish there was more on the plate. 
Overall great atmosphere. Has a modern hip feel. I would return to try their other dishes",5
7758,"Rip off place, unprofessional, liars....
Charge $100 dollars something for a checkup, then I'm told the cv axle on my car is going bad, they quote for nearly $1,000 dollars which they said the parts are $300 each side( I bought from local shop before, it's about $100 for a new piece) ..and 5hours of labor.. Total lies.. CV axles are not that difficult to replace! 

A little while after, I got a quote from Dealership they only charge about $400 for parts and 2.5hours of labor.. Total at about $700 job done...Save your money and time, go look for some other reliable mechanic shop..",1
7761,"This is bakery and deli heaven. I try to get here at least once a month, driving an hour, just for their lunch. A fantastic, fresh sandwich with your choice of ingredients on sourdough, baked fresh in their bakery. Their homemade soups are always satisfying and flavorful. Both together are just a tenner and you get one of the best lunches in Calgary. 

Imagine you had a fantastic chef for a friend. This is what going to his/her house for lunch of soup and sandwiches would be like. 

Do yourself a favour and go. Just go.",5
7763,Awful. Greasy BEC sandwich. Will not ever try again. Still on the hunt for a decent breakfast in Nevada.,1
7764,"We only ever get their food delivered. But it is always amazing! Sometimes they forget my meat sauce but I don't even care usually because I love the food. If we need a go to delivery that comes quick, hot and fresh Rosati's is always my go to. We never have any left overs even though their portion size is huge. We eat it all because their food is just that amazing. I've gotten delivery directly from Rosati's and they are always so sweet and nice on the phone!",5
7765,"Waited for 1 1/2 hours for French fries by the pool.  Ridiculous.  

Staying till Monday. Hopefully better service tomorrow",1
7767,"Dinner was everything I expected and more!  Absolutely delicious!!!!  I had the Lawry's cut prime rib ($39) with creamed spinach ($6).  They start you off with their table side prepared spinning bowl salad which was very good.  They recommend you use Lawry's seasoned pepper on it which did make it taste even better.

The Prime Rib I ordered medium.  It was sooooooo good.  Melt in your mouth tender.  It really was a slice of meaty heaven.  I enjoyed seeing it cut table side for me.They give you hot and mild creamed horseradish so I combined them and that was perfect.  Unfortunately, I could only finish half my dinner.  I took it to go because I could not stand to leave it.  It deserved to be eaten.  Service was great and the dining experience was a real pleasure.  Dinner with a glass of cab and tip was $75.

I highly recommend it if you're looking for Prime Rib to remember!",5
7768,"My favorite salon in Phoenix. It's such a cute, welcoming place with employees that treat their clients and co-workers like family. The hair stylists and nail techs will go out of their way for anyone. Every cut and color I've had done from there has been perfect and everything I've asked for. I will never leave this place!! 

Oh and there's fresh treats, iced tea, lemonade and coffee always ready for you when you walk in!",5
7775,"Awesome gym with great staff. No judging and no bullsh*t. You will work hard, but it pays off!",5
7776,Awesome gyros!! Best in the area!! Salads are awesome too!! They are not shy with the meat!!,5
7777,"Dont walk, RUN!!! The Silverton is a DUMP!!!! 
The walls, doors, carpet all need replacing. I mean filthy to the point that it cant be cleaned. .And lets not mention the bathroom..filth on top filth.. discusting..
Remember the berkley and the silverton are night and day.. thumbs up for the berlkey. Your better off at a bus station than spending time and money at the silverton",1
7778,"This was my first time visiting this Wendy's location. I rarely eat fast food, but my boyfriend has the flu and requested a frosty and fries, so that's what I got him! If I could give this place 0 stars, I absolutely would. Customer service is everything.

I pulled into the drive-thru and waited for my turn at the speaker. When it was finally my turn, the vehicle in front of me was still slightly in the way of me getting to the speaker. I could only see half of the board with the menu items. The attendant came on, I said, ""I can't see the number, but I would like the chicken nuggets meal"". The attendant and another employee busted out laughing through the speaker and said, ""I don't know what you're talking about."" I again said, ""I cannot see the entire board, I want whatever number the chicken nuggets meal is"". The attendant said, ""so you want a number 10""? I reply  the same way that I did the previous TWO times. Seriously, tell me my total so that I can move on from this unnecessary experience!! Finally, she gave me my total and I pulled forward.

The attendant opened the window and whatever she was eating/chewing on almost flew out of her mouth when she greeted me, and again she thought this was funny. The sad part is that this attendant appeared to be ""in charge"". I was absolutely disgusted.

Like mentioned, this was my first experience, and certainly my last. This Wendy's location manager should be thankful that it's in a very busy spot. If not, the location would be closed down.",1
7781,"The Happy Hour menu is very good, they changed it. We got 4 beers, a pizza and an appetizer for $25. Definitely will be going back soon :)",5
7783,"Got my hair done here for the Marine Corps ball. absolutley loved the girl doing and the salon, very intimate. Got my nails done as well and loved the woman who did them also. Thought it was overpriced but the services were great. Would consider returning.",5
7785,"This A&W has spoiled me, and I don't think any other will ever live up to the experience.  For the first time in my life, the meal I ate actually looked like what was pictured on the menu.  Crazy, huh?  The fries came in a little basket, the drinks in frosted mugs, the burgers fresh and hot and delicious.  It's no Ritz, don't get me wrong, it's a fast food place, but it's fast food like I imagine it to be.  So for the odd indulgence, this was amazing.  I will have to go back another time to make sure that this wasn't a fluke, that it is consistently good.",5
7786,"This is an amazing little place that surpasses expectations of the address! Amazing food from all parts of the world, cooked with nothing but fresh ingredients! I am a huge fan of clams and the ones I had here last Friday I think we're the best ever! Who would have thought great clams in the desert! And they also had a special pasta w/ Black Truffles
- amazing! Been here maybe 5 times so far, and can see it as one of my regular joints! Can't wait for the heat to pass and sit outside!! And their brunch.. insane! I don't drink but even I know it's all top shelf and prices you would see at strip happy hour!",5
7787,"This is Michael Mina's newest restaurant in Las Vegas. I have been to many other Michael restaurants so I thought I knew what to expect but this was different. 

Michael Mina has officially nailed casual! This place is a lot more low key than his other restaurants but is equally as tasty and refined. Our table ordered a BUNCH of appetizers and shared them. 

We got:
-Shelfish platter
-crabcakes
-crab deviled eggs
-nachos
-ahi tuna poke 

All of it was amazing! I particularly loved the ahi poke. It is similar to his famous tuna tartare but is more casual (if that makes sense?). 

I would definitely give this place a try.",5
7790,"I haven't been to qdoba since I moved out here. I happened to be in the area and dived back in. My original experience back in Florida was not all that great, but this was incredible. They have a unique menu with tasteful options, you can see them Saut√©ing fresh vegetables as I ordered. The staff was very, very nice. Most importantly the food was awesome! Thanks",5
7791,I used them for a ride from the Wynn to the airport. Left my phone in the back of the cab. Cora from the administrative office got it and sent it to me and called me several times about it. She was simply amazing. This is a first rate company!,5
7792,"Well, their website is still up, and taking orders for delivery, but they are ""closed until August 1, 2012"" according to their answering machine.  Glad I waited 1:15 to call and check on the order. This is basic stuff: closing your restaurant for a while? Update your website. F as in Fail. Epic Fail.",1
7794,"I purchased a 2014 Nissan Frontier for my son.  Our salesperson, Bruce Weiss was great! Overall the process was painless and fairly quick.  I will definitely recommend Larry Miller Nissan to my friends and family. I will be bringing the vehicle in for some minor fixes and look forward to the same great service.",5
7795,My wife and I drove to Concord Mills from Hickory and wanted to try something new.  Neither of us are Indian food experts so we asked our server Ashwin for some recommendations. He took the time to ask us a few questions about what we liked before suggesting Chicken Tikka Massala and Lamb Roganjosh.  We enjoyed both and look forward to coming again the next time we are in the area.,5
7799,"Craving satisfied!   We were in the area recently and noticed this new Indian place. Upon this sight my husband recalled his fondness for Lamb Vindaloo and we promised to go and try it. 

The food was excellent. We got the Lamb Vindaloo, Chicken Biryani, various types of Naan. The lamb was tender and incredibly flavorful.  We enjoyed a Mango Lassi and even had some dessert.  The whole meal was a treat for the palate.

Our positive experience was made possible by the warm and friendly service we received.  Our server was welcoming and attentive; answering questions and offering suggestions. We plan to return and look forward to trying some new dishes!",5
7801,"Hands down, the best groomers!! They did an excellent job turning my two ragamuffins (labradoodles) into works of art! Plus, they have great customer service and follow-up. I plan on becoming a repeat customer!!",5
7802,"My boyfriend and I went out for a date night and didn't make a reszo but we got a table within 20 minutes, which we thought was great! The costume service plummeted after that waiting to even see a waiter to take our order for over 30mins... It seemed like we were invisible...
Then the manager came over and took our order and we thought things were turning up but service was horrible and we left feeling neglected and that we had just spent a lot  for ordinary sushi.
Overall I would not recommend this restaurant and the idea of what it once was is just that an idea.",1
7803,I have been there 10 plus times now and still have never had a meal that wasn't outstanding.  Best authentic Mexican I have ever had and I travel the us for a living.  Just ask the server Richard for his favorite and you will never be disappointed.,5
7811,Food is great and the people are really nice. Good environment always leave full. They are a great post workout treat,5
7813,"Delicious healthy food and friendly staff, what else do you need? I didn't expect the place this big  and clean behind its heavy wood mysterious door. Glad  my discovery of combination of healthy and tasty Chinese food there-flavorful but no grease.
I will definitely come back.",5
7817,"This place is awesome! I have been going here for about 3 years now and they have been accommodating, nice, and make you feel  comfortable. I remember feeling really nervous the first time I went. Kristy is great every time. I have had other waxer's and felt no difference so far. I def reccomend this place.",5
7820,Not happy with the service. Went to the shop to have a car checked out before purchase. Technician Chris failed to detect the malfunction of the front passenger door lock. Now it's a $500 problem I have to take care of. Wish they could have been more thorough. Would avoid using them again.,1
7821,"FINALLY! An awesome down-low beer drinkin' watering hole that is cool as the ice rink itself. I needed a place to watch Bruins/Canadiens game 7 and this place is right near work convenient location. Not a bunch of rednecks or gang members, the clientele was upper 20's to 40's and 'normal'. It has an unusual two-level layout, the lower area where I was you overlook the ice rink and pucks come flying into the boards once in awhile to wake you up. It was fun - and I was surprised to see such a huge and sophisticated beer list. But of course its hockey, beer loving Canadians come here so maybe not so unusual. Not a food place so eat dinner first, but to cool your heals in central Phoenix its my new place.",5
7822,"My name is Kate. And I am addicted to Kawa Sushi. 

I remember when I first moved into my apartment my landlord mentioned Kawa. ""Oh that place is good! It recently opened so it's nice to see they have business,"" he casually stated. Little did I know, this was only the beginning.  

Fast forward a handful of months. Kawa Sushi and I are now the best of amigos. Am I feeling lazy? Craving sushi? I can simply call and place an order and in 10 min it's ready. I have become a regular and the adorable staff laugh at my love for their salmon sushi pizza. Now and again they'll even throw in a free miso soup, because they're just that delightful. 

Care if I list a few more reason why I love it so?
- The price! $4 Salmon rolls! $7 for a giant (and I mean giant) Green Dragon roll! Yummy combos! 
- The staff! They are so so nice! It's a family business, and sometimes you'll spot they're young lil son (who is basically twins with that kid in Up) playing on his game boy. When my friend Amy and I stopped by for a snack on Halloween he even shared some of his Halloween candy with us. And he was dressed up as Buzz Lightyear. And it was so cute.   
- Did I mention the sushi pizza? Sushi pizza.

Kawa makes giving into my sushi cravings way too easy. And delicious. Go.",5
7824,What a waste. I can't read signs when I'm driving so I get a prescription. I finally get around to ordering glasses online and see that the woman only gave me a prescription for readers!!! Now I'll have to go somewhere else on my dime to be able to see while I'm driving. Waste of time and insurance and I'll never be back.,1
7827,They always take such good care of me and my mom who toe injuries. They are gentle and sweet! Its the best nail salon I have ever been too! They also do punch cards which is a neat insensitive. Love this place.,5
7829,"Great food, Great dessert! What more can you ask for? I've tried other Viet restaurants in the area and this is by far the best one. Always fresh food and prompt service. Moreover, they have double doors so you won't feel the cold draft!",5
7830,Went to this place while on vacation in Tempe. Place looked chill from the outside and we were starving so my friends and I decided to check it out. The salsa tasted like someone put a jar of oregano in it. It was awful! I ordered a Carnitas burrito. I had to ask them to add beans and rice to a 10 dollar burrito. I was like what the hell?? Asked them to put green sauce on it as well. It was sooo bland and boring. Green sauce had no spice or flavor. Would not recommend this place. Crappy and overpriced. My friends dish was also very bland. Should of went to Del Taco. The good side was that the Staff was friendly..,1
7831,"We stayed at THEhotel in October of 2004 for our wedding weekend.  The overall experience at Mandalay Bay was amazing and this topped it off!!  I am so glad we booked a suite here!!  The rooms were gorgeous, spacious and clean.  The view was amazing!  The beds and the bedding were great too!!!  And you won't read that from my reviews often.

There were only a few downfalls, which really didn't damper our weekend... Our friends and family weren't familiar with the difference of THEhotel compared to the regular section of Mandalay Bay so people were constantly lost trying to find our room even when we explained the difference.  Also, it took over an hour to stand in line to check in!!  It was really busy!!

I highly suggest booking here... it's a favorite destination of ours!!",5
7833,"This place is such a little gem. The building is a small cottage style refurbished home and though there aren't many seats, the spot is cozy and inviting. They have a pretty decent patio as well. On occasion they have live music which is always a welcome treat. Their coffee and tea is seriously delicious. My most recent venture was an ESPRESSO SPRITZER. I mean, how could I not? It has all the delicious elements of my beloved espresso, only it's served icy cold and with seltzer, making it unbelievably refreshing. I also spoiled myself an had the ""sweet quiche"" which was basically a creme-br√ªl√©e-custard-pudding slice with assorted fruits throughout. Heaven. More than anything, they're incredibly friendly and accommodating. Definitely happy I went and I will be back.",5
7834,"Get ready to be jacked for fees! Make sure you ask about additional fees specifically, because they won't tell you until you get a bill in the mail. Then they'll play dumb and act like you should have known. Skip this place and go somewhere else.",1
7835,The guy behind the counter said I was going to like their burgers WOW was he right !this place rocks... definitely no corporate assembly line pre cooked  feel here .They are even better then  restaurant burgers & fries in my opinion & lets not forget the whole dive feel they have going without trying  5 STARS BECAUSE I CANT GIVE 6,5
7836,Their food is amazing and their service rocks! Wish they had a location in Henderson. ;),5
7837,"This is my first review that I am giving for any website !!

Thanks yelp for making my stays amazing !! I know I can totally depend on you to find the most amazing restaurants anywhere i go !! 

Elias is amazing !! He is  a marketing genius atleast in his profession !! and yes ,the free apple cake is true and it tastes gr8 !! I picked up a salad platter which was really good !! and pretty cheap at 7 (tax incl) but more than the food,it is the experience which will make you come back !! atleast i know,i will !! Its even close to my office",5
7840,"Admittedly, I'm a Poke Box addict. I go here at least once a week and the super friendly staff now knows my order. It's great that I can walk in and smile and watch as the soft sushi rice base is thrown into its brown cardboard chalice. It's followed with a delicate yet necessary spray of seaweed flakes before being passed down the proverbial Pokessembly Line where two generous clumps of red and white crab salad are lowered into the lair. Then the magic happens. Cucumber, edamame, onions, and jalape√±os accompany soft and succulent morsels of salmon sashimi as a waterfall of spicy mayo and unagi sauce drowns the ingredients in a marriage of culinary delights. The mixture is gently spooned into the box and topped with an optional drizzle of unagi essence. Now at the end of the line, crispy fried shallots and wasabi peas dust the box, as if to place the cherry on what would have already been a perfect sundae.",5
7841,I work right by this place and have gone in several different times and days and everytime I have had the worst service. They either get my order wrong or the person behind the counter is super rude. I always want to support local businesses but I can no longer support this place.,1
7845,"Beautiful food and room. Perfect service. Each ingredient was perfectly showcased and beautifully handled. Standouts were black oyster mushrooms, incredible baked celeriac, delicate but intensely flavoured trout and financiers (perfectly buttery) and amazing sour cherry puree. The duck was also perfectly cooked and served with an slightly sweet and intensely flavoured miso accompaniment. Thank you for this sophisticated food and restaurant - it reminded us of Luksus in Brooklyn, so nice to have a restaurant of this calibre here in Toronto.",5
7846,"Holy cow, chicken, and pork! Hands down the BEST BBQ in Phoenix! Everything is well prepared and filling! Best go with an appetite and best get there early because they can sell out of things really fast. I'm normally not a big fan of creamed corn, but these guys have converted me and I'm hooked! Definitely will be back for more! Good job guys!!",5
7850,"Let's see, where to start? Got the fried ""Mac n Cheese"" bites, that just happened to be filled with boxed Mac n cheese, DEFINITELY not home made. And the baked beans, CANNED! Pork ribs were extremely over cooked, as was the beef brisket. The brisket looked like days old pot roast, completely grey in color and dry as a tube sock. No smoke rings, no moisture AT ALL. It clearly won the BBQ championships FIFTEEN years ago because it wouldn't win third place at the local retirement home with what they serve now. If you want consistently good BBQ, go to Dickeys.",1
7851,"I LOVE everything about this place. The staff, decor, food, the owner; all of it. The servers, bussers, and runners are all friendly and all have awesome personalities. The head honcho though is kick ass. He's hilarious and always takes good care of us every time we come in. I've tried almost all the pancakes they have but my all time favorites are ""The Lips"" (red velvet with strawberries) and the ""Always November"" which is pumpkin pancakes with whipped cream and cream cheese. The only ""bad"" thing I have to say is that the location is small. Hopefully in the future they can knock down some of the walls and make the place bigger because it is a little cramped. Aside from that:

-Prompt service
-Awesome staff
-Bomb food

What more do you need? There won't be a Sunday that I don't have breakfast here.",5
7854,"It disheartens me to rank them so low. They were once a favourite for my wife and I to visit but our last two times here have been very disappointing. 

The quality of food was once upon a time among the elite of Whitby but now falls in line with what I would expect to get at Jack Astors. Don't worry though, they still charge you premium fine dining prices.

Let's not forget about the service. The waitress was aloof and seemed to really not care too much for her career choice. Maybe I'm just a snob but when you're clearing all the tables and preparing them for the next days breakfast (i.e. removing the table clothes and putting out jams), it really gives what's priced to be a fine dining experience a real ghetto feel. Maybe that's their new niche though? Ghetto Fine Dining!

Needless to say unless they can go back to their ways of old, I won't be going back again.",1
7855,"Bonnie. Bonnie is the hostess with the mostess. From start to finish she was making sure our experience was the best. Bartender was very attentive. Food was delicious could use a little more chick with chicken and waffles but the chicken was very tender and the corn bread waffle was the best. 

Can't wait until next time.",5
7857,I quit drinking 2006 but I still enjoy non alcoholic beer with my food when we go out to eat . Well I guess some corporate douche decided not to serve it anymore.  Sorry douche bag we won't come back,1
7859,"This is the most unprofessional office I have ever been to.  I made an appointment for a potentially life threatening situation.   I arrived at the office and filled out 5 pages of forms.  When the nurse called back, she began asking questions.  I mentioned that I had seen a GI doctor early in 2017.  She said oh, I need those records before Dr. Haikal will see you.  I am on a new job and still on probation.  I cannot take off just because.  She refused to let me see the Doctor.  I was very upset.  No bedside manner whatsoever and certainly no compassion.  Needless to say, I got the records and my Husband took them over to their office.  I had written a letter to them telling them that if they need additional blood work, to let me know so I could do that prior to my visit so I am not taking so much time off work.  I received a call from the nurse stating that Dr. Haikal refused to see me as a patient, but she did not know why.  That is total bull. She knew exactly why.  What an unprofessional cruel thing to do to someone who is very scared and concerned.  The whole staff is rude and very much lacking in patient care skills.  When it is all said and done, it is probably for the best as he sounds like a total jerk.  I will be seeing a different doctor next week.  Patient beware.  You can't be too careful in this town!   I wouldn't recommend a sick rat to this place.",1
7860,"Leia is a skin GENIUS! She is calming, friendly, caring, happy, and an overall JOY to be around. I have been WAXING for about 25 years. Tired of all the inconsistent and botched jobs at the random places I was trying since moving to NE Ohio (or alternately remaining hairy until I returned to my regular spot in NYC - this was becoming less and less feasible as the time btwn visits was expanding), I decided to put my money towards my desired outcome,  and gave a high-end salon a try. There I met Leia. My experience left me dumbfounded, like ""Yeah, I'll pay for this"" as my relaxed body and mind was peeled from the table. (No post waxing irritation!!!) After such a relaxing & enjoyable waxing experience (seems like an oxymoron, no?!), I went for a FACIAL. Good Lord, I had gone to heaven! When Leia opened her own spot, there was NO doubt I'd drive the 40 minutes just to get waxed. 

I gift facials to my 20-something daughter time & time again; each time she visits me an appt w Leia is eagerly awaited.  Most recently I took my mom to Leia for a facial. My mom is sparse w praise and quick to critique. My mom was BLOWN away by Leia in every way. My mom had some ""trouble"" areas and while initially resistant to Leia's advise, followed the advise and experienced unexpected results. She also became a Leia devotee, and told me, ""Book us appts when I next visit Ohio"". Need I say more?! So from 20-something skin (my daughter) to 40-something skin (me) to 60-something (my mom), Leia has the midas touch!  

This is a small one person operation. Don't expect a receptionist to answer the phone. It may take a day or two for Leia to get back to you, and then she will personally respond to your inquiry and set up an appt to meet your needs.

On another note - Leia is ALL about a BODY POSITIVITY! No body shaming here. Any size, any shape, any gender - Leia's mission, goal, objective is to make you feel beautiful! Beautiful and relaxed you will feel once Leia lays hands on you and soothes you w her beautiful, calming voice and smile.

Can't wait for my next appt! =)",5
7861,"I've only been here for Happy Hour, but the appetizers and the martinis are excellent!  I highly recommend the calamari.  You can't beat the view the restaurant offers and the Happy Hour is a really good deal!",5
7865,Leslie is amazingly knowledgeable and knows her spots. Seeing her for many things. Highly recommend.,5
7866,"DO NOT RENT FROM THEM!!!

1. Your place WILL NOT BE CLEANED when you move in. 
2. They IGNORE MAINTENANCE REQUESTS 
3. They DO NOT RETURN PHONE CALLS
4. They will evict you for withholding rent EVEN THOUGH they are in the wrong...AND THEY KNOW IT. 

I moved in 8/15, turned in a maintenance request for the following:
1. FILTHY house. I paid $250 to have someone clean this house and they STILL haven't reimbursed me. Yolanda's excuse? I sent my runner to inspect it before you moved in & he said it was clean. NOPE!
2. NO WORKING LIGHTBULBS. 3 don't count. 
3. FILTHY CARPETS!!  Black. Just black. 
4. Walls are dirty & full of holes. 
5. Unstable bathroom floors. 
6. Unstable shower floor. 
7. NO LOCK on the slider. 
8. Broken closet door
9. Broken/missing blinds
This is just some of what I reported. 
See photos. 

After 4 months of playing their games, they finally fixed the floor. But nothing else. When the floors were fixed the toilets stopped working. They finally fixed that FRIDAY 1/7, and today the Constable taped an eviction order to my garage. 

The shower is STILL messed up.  I still don't have my $250 from them. They wanted to send a runner to look at everything-why? I gave them videos & pics. I left Yolanda a message on 1/3/17 to send their runner any day that week at 4:30. Did she?  Nope. I aske her to call my office and tell her when I leave work...she calls AFTER I leave work. No one answers the phone there. Ever. 

I am a paralegal. I know my rights & I know how to turn in a maintenance order. I gave these slum lords the benefit of the doubt & paid them in good faith anyway after a huge argument leading them to fix 1 thing. And now they do this crap.",1
7868,"This place is one of the bad place to buy , they have really bad bad quality , if you wanna spend your money for bad quality buy it here , I bought pants ,after one week it was torn , I just go to store to return it and the ugly manager yelling to me and she said I can't return it and I just throw it my pants in store and left , guys just remember when you buy it the anything from this store you have to put it inside your closed and just look it , don't buy it fir used , I paid $70 for just one week used and ugly manger said no return ,",1
7869,"The pizza was amazing. The other girls, in my party went back two more times to get the wings. They were alittle too spicy for me. The service was good. The atmosphere was very relaxing. If you go, ask for Alex- tell him the Texas girls, sent ya!",5
7870,"I live in California now, so I've got all sorts of options for Mexican food.  But when I'm back home I always end up at Mariachi's.  The food is good, the prices are reasonable, and the staff is always engaging and personable.  They have a large room that works really well for parties, too.",5
7871,A great experience!  They always have good live music and the flair bartenders are awesome!  I go to Vegas with a group of friends once a year and it has been our ritual since 2010 to spend our 1st night at Carnival Court!  We often make and 2nd and even 3rd stop before the week is over.,5

7881,"I understand this is a new concept to the area, phenomenal idea! The mangonadas are not traditional, which I understand everything has become more ""Americanized"". The wait time is always outrageous. I would not recommend, especially if you are in a rush or even on a lunch break. It is also about 95 degrees in the building, so I would recommend waiting outside for your order... but don't do that or lose your receipt with you order number because the extremely rude staff will not give you your order, and will also accuse you of trying to steal someone else's order. Would not recommend many other great places of the same concept, just have to travel about 15 min west of the location of this place.",1
7883,"Its not a big deal, its just fifty cents to check in.. but when we showed her my phone. She said we had to print it out. Whattt? Really? Smh. Anyways. Then I ask for extra hot sauce and lemon. She points at the bag and said "" in there"". Literally fighting me. It was just bad. Anddddd she forgot napkins.

Edit*
Came home and my enchiladas was cold. The cheese wasn't even melted.  :( ugh. im so mad.",1
7884,This place is soooooooo great!! DeNora and Greg and the entire staff are so hospitable. Food is absolutely amazing. You have to have the mussels!! I personally recommend this to all my friends and bring my family here every chance I get. Also - fantastic happy hour special: $20 bottle of wine and a pie!!!,5
7892,Had a great experience.  This was my first time there and I'm glad I went.  The food was great and came out at a very good pace.  Our server Brittany was very attentive and on point.  The atmosphere was very nice.  High end enough for a fancy dinner but casual enough for a quick meal and some beers with your friends.  Sighned up for the rewards card because I'll definitely be back.,5
7893,We went to Las Vegas for my wife's Birthday and spent the weekend at The Venetian Hotel. We are not big on gambling but love the night life and excitement that Vegas has to offer. This place is absolutely beautiful and has such wonderful atmosphere with great Italian renaissance elements everywhere. Our room was upgraded free to beautiful suite with all the amenities you would expect in a five star resort. We walked around the strip and found it to be not as exciting as it used to about 10 years ago. The strip is dirty and full of people trying to sell you stupid things and not family oriented. But we took a walk for the experience and to take in the lights and excitement. We quickly decided to return to the Venetian to have dinner inside the resort. I will strongly recommend this hotel for Vegas you will not regret it and of course we plan on coming back soon.,5
7894,"Will never go back to this location. I was a new client to EOS and had the worst experience. The guy that signed me up and my personal trainer were the only two people that seemed to know what they were doing. I unfortunately had to cancel my membership due to an unexpected move and the communication never went up to the manager. My account went to collections because my phone calls were never given to the appropriate person, and I still months later have not received a phone call back in regards to this matter. The manager is never available and the staff just always seems to be clueless.",1

7896,"A co-worker raved about this place since I told her that I was new to the Tremont area. Soooooo glad she did. I originally came to grab a cupcake for my dessert treat. Pretty quiet and super duper clean in the inside. I was surprised that they served ice cream. Saw the different flavors and the Caramel Cashew caught my eye...I'll check out the cupcakes later...I want that ice cream. You get two scoops for $3.25 so I decided to also try the Red Velvet.  Both flavors were very delicious, especially the Caramel Cashew. 

The only tiny, non major thing that ""bothered"" me was the spoon, oh so tiny..lol felt super weird and silly eating with it.

A Cookie and A Cupcake definitely did not disappoint and worth a return visit.",5
7897,Tried Nello's for first time tonight & definitely not impressed... cheese pizza way too salty and at room temp cheese hard and looked like plastic.  Ate one piece and threw the rest out.,1
7900,"Ate here last week (7/16/2011) with wife and brother and his wife. All four of us agree it might have been best meal we ever ate. Kobe beef carpacchio, lobster bisque, 12 oz filets and the 20 oz ribeye with bearnaisse left our jaws on the floor. Steak was as good as or even better than Ruths Chris or Mortons here in Orlando. Price felt like we stole our meals. Thank you Lavo for making our last meal in Vegas unforgettable after some shoddy dinners in other places. A must eat when staying in Palazzo or Venetian, or for anyone out there!",5
7901,"Walked in about 7:45 on First Friday and were seated right away.  We managed to squeak right in between the post work crowd and the later diners, but the place was 90% full.

Service was fast and friendly, the waiter took his time making sure we understood the menu and explaining everything to us.

I had the Bavette al Cedro and my friend tried the Gnocchi alla Lupa, and we shared the lamb side.  Honestly, the pasta alone was good enough that I could have passed on the side, but I'm so glad I didn't.  Not sure how they prepare the lamb beyond the slow roasting, but it was tender and very moist.  I think I detected among the garlic and sea salt a nice touch of saffron.

My pasta was cooked just right, at first bite I was taken aback by how lemony it was, but quickly realized that the flavors were just perfect.  They balanced out in all the areas of taste.  I tried my friends gnocchi as well, and it was also just right. 

The serving sizes were just perfect, not overwhelming, but not skimpy either. I walked away glad I didn't eat more and able to pass on dessert.

We each had a Four Peaks, I had the 8th Street and he the Kiltlifter, and my only complaint there was that they were bottled and not draft. 

The whole meal was surprisingly quick, and the service was spot on.  I would love to go back and try a few more items off of their menu.",5
7904,"This place is the real deal for true foodies who want to take a break from the strip. We came here for lunch on a Saturday after reading the Eater reviews. We started with the butternut squash soup and artichoke, which did not disappoint. The moussaka with the impossible burger patty was delicious, and the Lamb-orghini sandwich on the Parisian baguette made my daughter very happy. We finished off with the French coffee and award winning Cremo puff. Service matched the high quality food. We will be back!",5

7912,"I don't know where to begin.  As of today we have been without internet service for 6 days.  We finally got someone out today to fix our service.  We'll see if it lasts.  It started last Monday (it's now Saturday) when we had intermittent connections.  I called ""tech"" and after a long, long menu finally got connected.  He ran me through 30 minutes (I kid you not) of ""fixes"" and I finally got so frustrated I threw the phone down.  My husband took over for another 15 minutes or so.  We were then connected for about an hour.  Then we went to the brick and mortar store and were greeted by a very rude ""associate"" who just wanted to sell us another modem when we already had 3 in a year and a half period of time.  We walked out frustrated again.  Finally I got ahold of Betti, a gal who has been there a long time.  By then it was Thursday, with intermittent service the whole time.  More off than on.  She scheduled a ""tech"" to come to our home on Friday.  We waited the 4 hour period on Friday, finally called to see where he was and was told they didn't have an order for our house!  Today we were scheduled again for a time period of 9-1.  He arrived at our house at 4:00.  I'm very, very unhappy with Century Link as a whole.  I feel for 6 days basically without service we should get a reduction in our bill.  I wonder how long we will wait for that?  Our contract is up in August and I think we will be looking for another service......",1
7917,"Had the furikake Bento with fried rice (kimchi, pork, green onion) and a side of Mac salad. Fried rice was awesome, beef and shrimp were great, didn't get a chance to try the chicken because I was already full. The Mac salad was good not great though. They are moving though to a new location on rainbow next to dairy queen soon, but not sure when. I will most likely be a regular here. =)",5

7921,It is awesome and only place to get an anthentic Mexican food!!! I Am local and visit this place when I'm craving for some gooood Mexican food. The employees are very nice and broad menus for you to choose. If you are visit Las Vegas Fashion Show mall food court I recommend you to check this place out! YOU WON'T REGRET!!!,5
7922,"If I could give it zero stars I would. Clustered mess from the time we walked in to the time we left. Our only saving grace was Stephanie the only person who seemed to try to help us. 

Checked in at 4 with the thought of having two rooms both with king sized beds, being we made reservation directly through Marriott. Got two rooms, with two double beds, not a huge deal. But keys didn't work to the room. This happened TWO more times before they sent someone to fix it, did I mention the phones didn't work either? We had to wait and exorbitant amount of time for the elevators every time. 

Been a fan of Marriotts forever, even am a elite reward member, would never stay here again.",1
7923,"Fan of the Loving Hut. Not this one, very disappointed. I ordered a tofu dish with vegetables and the amount of vegetables was embarrassing how few were included in the dish. Small tiny pea like size pieces cut up in amounts that I would guess/estimate would barely fill up a few tablespoons. I looked at the plate in disbelief how stingy the vegetable portion was. The other dish ordered was a dish we ordered many times at a Phoenix Loving hut and this one in comparison had little in the way of flavor and was a noticeably smaller portion. Both of us also came away not filled up. We won't be back at this loving hut and will continue to give our business to other Loving Huts.",1
7924,"Do not even get me started with this joke of a restaurant. Let me just start off by saying just because you are coming in with a Groupon does not mean you need to give mediocre service. The reason I gave you a shot was because you advertised a good deal and I paid more than my share even AFTER the Groupon value. It took two hours from start to finish for our dinner service. 1.5 hours of it was just waiting for the food because the kitchen was ""backed up"". They were pushing out other people's food that came AFTER us so how is the kitchen backed up?! Waitress (Mexican girl with the attitude) never asked us if we wanted refills on our drinks. Is it sad that our four year old had to ask for a refill on her drink? They ran out of beer so we had to get a margarita which is fine. Now here's the kicker.. our waitress came by to FINALLY take our order. Mid ordering she just leaves. No excuse me just up and walks away. She literally walked away to give someone their food an drinks and then decided 6 minutes later to come back and finish taking our order. Now I'm not sure if chips and salsa are given complimentary but we certainly did not receive it. I would not go back and highly recommend anyone who is thinking about coming NOT to either. There are plenty of other small business owned restaurants in Mesa to give business to just DO not to Rita's!",1
7925,"Great company, tech was on time and very knowledgeable! The carpets came out great and we will definitely use this company again!",5
7928,"This was the easiest car buying experience we've ever had... no pressure, friendly and informative salespeople, and extremely quick!  Thanks for making this such a pleasant process!",5
7929,What the heck Bruegger's! I ordered a Salmon bagel for $7 and they forgot the Salmon. Don't know how that was missed,1
7931,"Love it, lots o flavors to choose from and they are all good. Yummy! Places like this makes me miss Phoenix on those hot summer nights.",5
7932,"We have tried this place numerous times attempting to give them a second chance after ""re-opening"".  Our last try was a disaster.  The service has always been mediocre and the food has declined greatly. 
Supporting small businesses in Gilbert has always been priority to myself and my family; and I will always give them a second try but after a third try with this place - it's done. 
Our server Richelle provided us with less than mediocre service. She introduced herself and mentioned she would have someone ""shadowing"" her. We asked for water, cocktails and an appetizer. The chips and salsa, that they charge you for, were delivered to the table immediately. About ten minutes later our cocktails were delivered along with our water. I would think it would be much easier to bring water to our table immediately since the restaurant was empty. 
The chips are paper thin and the green salsa is sweet and the red tastes like it's out of a jar. There's no flavor whatsoever. 
When our appetizer nachos arrived they were very soggy due to the thin chips. We asked for a spicier sauce that was supposedly ""hot"" according to our waitress, it too turned out to be mediocre. 

After that we decided to go home and Door Dash some better options for more authentic Mexican food. 
Our waitress only appeared at the table three times, once to take our order, once asking about our food and delivering our ""spicy/bland"" sauce and finally to deliver our check. She seemed too busy gossiping about other restaurants and their lack of ""customer service"". 
As mentioned earlier, we will not be returning to this restaurant due to mediocre service and taste-less food. 
If you're looking for better Mexican food options, look elsewhere because this is not the place for you.",1
7933,"I would say that this outlet has a lot of the ""premium"" brand outlets that most people would be looking for, although I thought this place was total crap.

The ""common"" areas of this mall are all outside, so each business has doors to go in, it's like a giant strip mall. For people not familar with the stores names, you have no idea what's inside. So many of the window displays were hard to see, so we didn't end up going in many stores. This is probably the first ""mall"" I've went to in my life and not bought a thing. Lots of stuff here you'll find at other malls.",1
7934,"What a total waste of time, to save a few $$$?  Rude clerks to boot!  I booked a car on Southwest's website for pick up at the airport in vegas, and as everyone else experienced it took literally 1 hour to get thru the line, and their was only like 15 or 20 people in it!  I mean for like $2 a day more you can book another company and save grey hairs and hours of your life.  I don't know about you, but an hour of my time and stress is worth more than $2!
How hard could it be to staff more clerks when it's going to be busy?  the most frusterating part is that THEY KNOW IT WILL BE BUSY BECAUSE THEY HAVE 90% of their reservations AHEAD OF TIME!  I swear the management here must be complete idiots of not really give a crap about their customers or the future success of their business.  Who ever is staffing this place should be fired immidately and replaced with anyone.  I think the any drive thru clerk at MacDonalds could do a better job !",1
7936,"visited pittsburgh this past weekend and went to sienna since we heard there was a beer garden? lol 

arrived at 730 and put our name down on the first floor ... aaand the wait was an hr n a half long T_T so we just proceeded to the 3rd fl rooftop bar and got some beers to start~ wow the rooftop is just beautiful! the place was packed on a sat evening! most of the tables were taken and even the balcony was packed. Thankfully, we were able to get a table for our group of 5~ i was starving and wanted to get some appetizer to start.. but apparently the menus are different on every floor? the beer list was quite extenisve~ but appetizers were not too appealing.. so we decided to wait it out.

FINALLY after some time, our table downstairs was ready at last! thank god for that refreshing watermelon beer to keep my mind off of the hunger. lol the menu on the 1st fl was all about them balls of meat!  it is exactly like the meatball shop in NYC!! which i absolutely adore! so we knew exactly how this was going to go down.. pick a type of ball, a sauce and a side.  i got the ""saucey balls"" which is a set of 4 and i picked the traditional beef meat balls with pesto on top.  i was also ecstatic to see a menu for poutine! my o my~ i got my tater tots fix alright!  added some bacon to it and had a side of chicken gravy for dipping.  i wasn't big on the chicken gravy.. BUT surprisingly, the tots tasted fantastic with the pesto sauce from my bowl of meatballs!! so huh~ how bout that? tater tots with pesto..? 

i definitely struggled to finish all the things in front of me.. everything was delicious! including their special sausage meatballs~ and boy! was this hearty meal fulfilling and satisfying! watch out meatball shop in nyc! sienna mercato is right up in your alley! lol i would not b surprised if sienna mercato makes its way to the east coast~ the variations offered at sienna is a huge game changer!  PLUS tots?? i'm sold .. sry MBS~ you're gonna have to step up your game to win me back :P",5

7944,"This isn't one of those hipster ""we drip coffee through 18 different chilled funnels before we put it in your cup"" types of places.  The coffee isn't the best I've ever had, and there's probably way too much sugar in the syrups that I add to my peppermint mochas.  I'll likely end up with diabetes by the time I'm 40.  However, this Peet's still gets a 5 star review from me, since every time I come in to grab a morning drink (and sometimes an afternoon and evening one depending on the day), I'm greeted by a genuine, friendly smile, and sometimes multiple of them depending on the time of day (they seem to have increased staffing at busy times of day to catch up with the hoards of zombified nurses and doctors who drag themselves up to the counter at 7:45 AM).  There is no hipster ""I'm better than you"" air here, just actual nice people.  Chatting with the baristas at Peet's is a great way to start (and end) a shift.

I only wish they were open on Sundays and holidays, but I'll take what I can get.",5
7948,"DO NOT USE THEM. I just signed up for sma through my new insurance.  I called to make my first appointment but was told they don't have anything available for 2 MONTHS.  I just got out of the hospital and need care. I asked what happens if I get sick (like sinus infection, pneumonia, etc.) and need to see a doc right away. She said ""go to a hospital or find someone who can see you on short notice because we can't). Seriously? So they can't see me when I'm sick or well for 2 months?  What is the point of having them as my medical provider if they can't get me in when I'm sick? Apparently they are to big for their patients. I was so disappointed as online they seem great.  So now I will do what she said and find someone else to go to - full time.",1

7950,"Let me start off by saying this was my first time at outback steakhouse. I went in at lunch time and was seated and waited on immediately. I ordered the 7.99 lunch combo of a house salad & French onion soup.To be honest I wasn't expecting to get that great of a meal because chain restaurant aren't always the best quality or best tasting food, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The salad was fresh & crisp and the Italian dressing was very tasty. The French onion soup was great too. Our waiter was friendly & helpful. I have to say I had a great experience here & will be back in the future.",5
7951,"Great food and staff! We had the fish and chips, had the order split for 2 and it was plenty for us. Our server was really attentive and our drinks were filled fast.

It was a true pleasure going to a doctor who I felt truly cared about his patient.,5
7958,"In the beginning (2004), we bought a new Sienna minivan from a Toyota dealership in Minnesota. Three years later, we traded it in for a lease on another new Sienna. We did the same three years later, again in Minnesota. When we moved to Arizona in 2013, we weren't sure what to expect from the local dealerships. Not knowing any better, we went to the closest dealership to our house - Bell Road Toyota. That turned out poorly. High pressure sales people and lots of tacked on upsells when it came time to talk to the business manager. We were determined not to repeat our mistake. About a year ago we helped our daughter buy a used Corolla at AutoNation Toyota in Tempe, and the experience was much better, so we decided to give them a shot for our own vehicle when our highlander lease was up. It also helped that AutoNation has a great selection of in stock vehicles compared to the other dealerships around the valley. I started by browsing their web site, and once I found what I wanted, I started an online chat. I asked the agent to put me in touch with the fleet manager at AutoNation, and within a half hour Elijah (Eli) Owen gave me a call back. He confirmed the vehicle I liked was in stock and we set up an appointment to come see it the next morning. From the moment we arrived, it was clear we came to the right place. The difference was night and day. Where the Bell road salesperson immediately started in on his slick, schmoozy sales pitch the second he saw us, Eli did more listening then talking. He answered our questions and we never felt rushed or like he was trying to steer us toward something we didn't want. The paperwork went relatively quickly and we were in and out in 2.5 hours - much better than the seven hours at Bell Road, and actually faster than any other dealership we've bought/leased from so far. They do have a business office person (Charles in our case), and they will try to sell you on extended warranties, GAP insurance, etc, but that is pretty common for most dealerships. You can always say no (and I'd recommend saying no at least at first - they will usually cut the price if you do). We ended up getting GAP insurance and a little extra coverage on the battery and tires, but it only raised our monthly payment by 13 dollars from what we had discussed out on the floor. That's a lot better than Bell road when our payment went up around $150 during that stage of the negotiation. So far the van has been great. We had one question which Eli was able to clear up via a very quick phone call. It was worth driving an extra half hour to come to this dealership, and I have no doubt we will be back in three years when we're finished with this lease. One more thing about Bell Road Toyota - watch out for 5 star reviews. They actually offered to give us a free dash mat if we left a 5 start Yelp review. Sorry, not gonna happen. You have to earn that, like AutoNation Toyota in Tempe did.",5
7959,"Clearly the woman Denise who left a negative review never read her adoption form which stipulates BH has the right to remove the adopted rabbit at any time if they deem necessary - in cases of abuse and neglect.

7961,"Went for lunch today. Got the cheese burgers and poutine. The burgers were definitely meaty and succulent on fresh white buns. Cooked almost perfectly. 

The real star of the show was the poutine though which we almost got as an after thought. The fries were perfectly cooked. Done all the way through with a nice crispy exterior. The gravy was some of the best I've ever Had. The cheese , the curds and fries just combined to form the most delicious  meledy of flavours.

I'll definitely be back.",5

Instructors are really nice, not snotty and will take the time to fix your posture. They are excellent communicators and if you are a super beginner like myself, this is the place to go to!
And there's always tea and water so you can enjoy and after your class by sitting in the sofa area.
Plus, they have spa services as well.
I also love their shopping area with lululemon, jewellery, James Perse clothing and imported organic bath and beauty products from the UK.
They also sell yummy healthy snacks.",5
7967,Had so much fun here. Great service and great bottomless mimosas! Definitely get the chilaquiles. So good!,5
7969,"All I can say is excellent in every aspect.  The fried chicken is mouth watering, the waffles are the best I have had, and the red kool aid is so damn good!  I don't know how they make the red kool aid like they do, but it's the best.  The service is always friendly and fast, and I have ate here numerous times.  I have never once had bad food or a bad experience.  Thank god I found this place in phoenix.",5
7970,Absolutely delicious!!! Went for the first time today and was very pleased with my Cheese burger and fries! I plan on going back tomorrow for the Sonora dog. Mmmm!,5
7971,Wonderful folks. Great service. Don't forget to stop by the doggie bakery next-door to the grooming area. Terrific hand baked doggie goodies for your best friend!,5
7973,"My bro was the one who found out about this place.. and I gotta say... I'm very glad he did! It's another Korean restaurant I can go to when I'm craving for something quick, authentic, and fresh.

Service was awesome and the staff was great. I didn't catch our server's name, but she was really nice. The restaurant itself is a casual sit down; not fancy at all. It is very clean and pretty spacious throughout. As for their menu, it is very simple and there's not much you can customize. I know some people prefer a more vast menu, but don't let a selective menu fool you. What I love about places with a very specific menu, is that you know they are the best at making just those items. ;] In most cases, they are chef specialties.

I have tried their spicy noodle bowl, spicy tofu soup, kimchi fried rice, and several other dishes. A must-try is their fried dumplings. They are homemade; and you can tell by the flavor and quality. You do have the option of ordering them steamed, but the fried one seems to be more popular.

I've became a regular here for good reason. I love authentic Asian food because, being Asian myself, I am pretty picky about how certain foods will live up to my expectations. So, if you are looking to have a casual meal that has authenticity, freshness, and flavor, I highly recommend this place. :]",5
7976,After over a year of hearing all of my stores clients tell me how wonderful this salon is I finally went. WOW!!!! It has to be the best hair salon in scottsdale not just because it is the most beautiful because my hair color and cut is amazing. If you are even thinking about going there it is a must. You won't regret it!,5
7977,"One of the best self served yogurt places, it's cheap and there is rad seating outside and there are plenty of flavors and toppings",5
7978,"This review is a long time past due. But, as they say, better late than never.

I purchased a Beautyrest Katherine mattress (a hybrid of memory foam on individual coils)  from Bedrooms Today back in November. The salesman (David) was very helpful and patient in helping me choose the right mattress. Additionally, a few days later, when my measurements showed that the combination of the new mattress I had chosen along with the box springs would sit up too high, they came to the rescue with a solution, replacing the box springs with a ""bunkie board"".

In spite of my good experience so far, when my bed was first delivered it was so much stiffer than the one I had tested in the showroom, I was immediately concerned. David at the store advised me that it would take a while to break it in, so I decided to give it some time. A month passed and the mattress still wasn't comfortable to me. I woke up frequently with sore joints and a sore back. Again, David advised me that it sometimes takes up to three months to adjust to this type of mattress. Well, as hard as it was for me to believe, and as frustrated as I became, he was exactly right. By the end of three months, the mattress was (and still is) so comfortable that I don't want to get out of bed in the morning.

I'll admit I was beyond skeptical, but I came to find out that David was as good as his word. I would definitely recommend that you give Bedrooms Today a try if you're in the market for a new mattress. It's too bad that mattresses such as this require such a long break-in period, but my patience (though I lost it a few times) was certainly rewarded.",5
7979,"I've been meaning to review iFocus Vision Center for a while now.  I don't have any major eye issues so my experience with them is just a few appointments over the last two years, but all my experiences have been great.

Everyone on staff is knowledgeable and makes sure to personalize everything they do with you to you.  They are very digitally focused and make it easy to receive receipts and prescriptions.  They are able to find my file and my information immediately when I have questions.

I have not dealt with glasses here, only contacts and vision testing, and pre-testing for LASIK.

They have some of the best, most advanced vision testing tools and their prices are very reasonable.  The office staff is also very familiar with most insurances and have no problem calling them for you.  They are also great at following up with you when they need to go find some information.  

The doctor is also great, remembers people, and spends as much time with you as you need.

Because medical care can be such a hassle with insurance and paperwork and receipts, it's really important to me to take care of these needs in an office which really seems to put the patient first.  I am met with frustrations and disorganization with staff at almost every medical office I visit in Las Vegas, with the exception of iFocus Vision Center.  However they are doing it, they should serve as a model for other local medical offices.",5
7980,Great product and even better customer service! From the initial quote to installation I've been very pleased. American Decora had the best prices out of the 3 companies I inquired with. I'm just so excited! My house looks better already. Thanks!!,5
7981,"Decided to try eyelash extensions and found Heather's website, sent in an inquiry and she responded right away with a menu of her eyelash services!  I called her the next day to discuss and make my appointment.  Heather is very knowledgeable of her products and is also extremely mindful of the adhesive she uses, and uses the best money can buy.  It's been about a month since my first visit (and one refill at 2 weeks!) and not only do I still LOVE them, I'm still receiving compliments everyday on how great my eyes look!  She is a delight to be around, and is positive, and helped me relax in the chair and give her control.  And finally, the lashes look NATURAL, which is what I believe every lash challenged girl truly wants.  Definitely looking forward to our continued relationship!!",5
7982,"I am very disappointed with my experience here. This was our (my husband, daughter and myself) 3rd visit and while not impressed our previous times today was a disaster. The hostess was extremely rude, the service was non existent and the food was cold. The table next to us got their food, ate and left before we got our order with no apologies or explanations. We had brought a guest with us and frankly I was embarrassed because the location was my choice. I don't see how this place rates the rave reviews I have heard. I am not sure if it's because we have a small child and they are targeting the hipster crowd but we felt very unwelcomed and unwanted there. Very sad and we will not be going back.",1
7984,"We recently discovered this place through ubereats , so we've only ever had it via delivery so I can't rate the actual location  itself but I can rate the food. Even by delivery we're blown away by how delicious the food is every time and using such simple dishes/ingredients. We've tried a variety of their sandwiches (marinated chicken , chourico, and bifana-pork) and their side dishes (potatoes and rice). I can't even pick a favourite sandwich because they're all delicious the meat inside is always juicy and packs such big flavour and the bread is always sooo sooo fresh ! you can also choose to have the spicy sauce on the side. The rice and potatoes are also very tasty and well prepared with great seasoning. They take such simple dishes and simple ingredients and make them shine and at really great prices.ive had homemade Portuguese dishes which I loved and this place really has that home cooked prepared with love flavour . I'm craving it right now as I'm writing this :) definitely ordering from here again and again !",5
7985,"Most unprofessional establishment I've ever dealt with.

Keller Williams put up a post for a property on Trulia, and within a couple of hours we tried to respond to it. They completely ignored our calls and emails for DAYS. It took 4 days of calling for the property manager, Joni Villalobos, to finally pick up the phone.

She proceeded to give us some spiel about how she couldn't rent the house to us right now because she needed to talk to the tenant (which I gather was a total lie). We conceded, but asked that we be first in line when the property is available, which she agreed to.

Of course, whenever we would call to check on the status of the home, she completely ignored us. For a week she never responded once. We tried to go through someone else at Keller Williams multiple times, but everybody just said that there was nothing they could do. We needed to talk to Joni. Finally (much to our surprise) she picked up the phone. What did she have to say? They had rented the house to someone else 3 days ago.

It was a carnival of unprofessional behavior. I asked to speak with her manager after we found out that she gave the home away. Of course, the manager wasn't in. They said that he/she would call us the next day. Never heard from them.

Don't bother giving Keller Williams the time of day. they don't deserve it. We were treated like trash; blatantly lied to, constantly ignored, and generally disrespected. It amazes me that this place is still operating.",1
7987,"I've tried several places to try and sells my clothes to, and this is the ONLY place that gave me a reasonable amount for the clothes I was selling. And the girls up front were super friendly, fast and helpful. Not only did I get a decent amount of store credit. I was able to get 2 men's dress shirts, a pair of Steve Madden wedges, and 2 women's dress shirts for what I traded. The store is very organized and has amazing stuff at really good prices. Recommend over Name Brand Exchange ANYDAY.",5
7988,Experienced and well trained in her field. Friendly and accommodating. Trustworthy!,5
7989,"I never knew this little sandwich gem existed next to my office. It's walking distance from our building so it's very convenient especially if you got a precious parking spot that you are not willing to lose! 

They have both hot and cold sandwiches. You order at the counter and take a number. They bring the food to your table. I tried the philly cheese steak sandwich (without cheese unfortunately) and a side of potato salad. 

The order came out pretty quick. The food was hot and delicious. The potato salad was fresh and was done exactly right. Even though my sandwich did not have cheese in it, it was about one of the best steak sandwiches I've had! The portion size was also pretty big. I could have easily packed half my sandwich for dinner but it was so good, I decided to just go ahead and finish it (embarrassing, I know!). Prices are average so it's definitely a spot you wouldn't mind visiting often. 

I'm so glad my TL shared this place with me. He has tried pretty much every sandwich they have and I probably will be doing the same soon. 

Excellent find!",5

7993,"I wish there was a fabulous locals bar in Henderson with consistent affordable food for me to show some love for, but honestly I have yet to find one as good as BJ's ! 

Some updated reasons why I love this place:
*Happy Hour pricing during all football games
*They make a light (135 calorie/pint) beer in house that doesn't suck
*Ahi Tuna poke. No it's not as good as Poke express, but this is a bar and it's $5.55 during HH and is served with lots of beautiful green avocado ! Shockingly fresh and tasty for a chain.
*They now offer brunch! They open at 10 AM for the early games and have a lengthy brunch menu including breakfast pizza and captain crunch french toast . 
*Great football viewing in the bar area. 6 games on at once, perfect visibility, HUGE screen. PT's can't touch this place for football watching.
*No gaming, no smoking
*Huge menu 

Sadly, it's just a corporate chain, but they are consistent, cheap, and great for football watching. Hard to beat that combination !",5
7994,"We read the reviews on Trip Advisor, but since our daughters track team booked this hotel, we decided to stay with the group. I won't do it again!  We even saw the bed-bug report - yuk!!!

When we got in the room, the bathroom floor was so dirty and had hair on the floor. I'm sure they only clean behind the toilets once a month. The bathtub spout was rusted and the ceiling mold dusted. The walls were marred throughout the room. I cringe to think what secrets that awful dark green carpet kept.

When we pulled out the sofa bed for the kids, there were so many crumbs and an old water bottle top underneath. Disgusting! Their housekeeping is sub-standard. My 13 year old daughter refused to sleep under the covers.

We called to notify them about the bathroom and they said they'd take care of it in the morning and would let the manager know. Ha! Of course that never happened.

All I can say is we were excited to check-out and go home!  Read and heed the reviews on Trip Advisor!

7996,"Seasoned flyer here and beside myself in disbelief with AA.
I have to say that all of the employees I dealt with were great. My issue is with the operations of check in process. 
In 2003 and 2004 I flew over 106,000 miles on this airline. What the hell happened to this company? 

I couldn't check in online. Called and there were 5 aisle seats (as well as others) but they told me the airport had control of the seating and I couldn't obtain a seat even if I wanted to pay for the premium one. I had to get my seat when I check in. 
Get to check in and they tell me I have to get my seat at the gate. Get to the gate and nobody is there. Wait 20 minutes and the gate attendant (who was very nice) walks up and turns everything on and tells me the flight is full and she cannot assign me a seat. I told her that I called yesterday and their were 5 aisle seats available. She said there aren't any seats available at all and she was going to be calling for volunteers to give up their seats and take a later flight. 
She said she would call people up to assign seats. 
What a completely inefficient and painful process. 
Why do they make it soooo painful to use their airline?
Take a lesson from Southwest and think about the customer experience and cater your operations for them.",1

Good selection of beers and wine. Pumpkin beer is perfect for the ladies!",5
8007,"Is this the best diner ever? It really is. I was there last year and the wait was about 3 hours. I was glad there was no wait this year because driving for 4 hours, I just wanna eat. Their sugar is awesome (colorful and pretty). Their prices are more than affordable and there portions are more than fair. Most are shareable. I got a breakfast combo plate and everything was superb. I shared with my sister and it was about $13 for the plate. We were extremely full after and didn't eat for the rest of the day. Awesome customer service and they are lenient with substituting sides for no extra charge. It's right next to Riviera hotel.",5

the seared tuna is also quite tasty too.

for appetizers the grilled octopus is to die for!  seriously tasty.

8009,"I did not expect this.

Absolutely winging it with a quick Yelp search, I whatever-d it this day. ""Uptown, uptown, something, something, sushi. Let's just do it"". But, like they say, you find love when you're not looking, right? My expectations may have been at an all-time low, but, I loved it all!

It was between 11:30~3PM! So we took advantage of their lunch specials.

We got:
- ""Lunch Special 3"" ($8.95) 6pcs Roll, 3pcs Sashimi &3 pcs Sushi
- ""Lunch Special 1""  ($8.95) 9pcs Sashimi; 4pcs Sushi & 3pcs Roll
- Deep-fried Soft Shell Crab ($9.95)

It was super fresh and the pieces of Sashimi absolutely melted in my mouth. I enjoyed every delicious bite of it! The Soft Shell Crab is a no-go though - it's sad and scrawny. 

Word is... there are Weekly Specials!!! 
(12~3PM):
- Mondays are Teriyaki specials (save $1!)
- Tuesdays are Salmon specials - 15pcs OR a Salmon Sushi set for $8.95
- Wednesdays are Roll specials ($1~2 off)
- Thursdays are Udon specials ($1~2 off)

We were already finishing off on such a great note, then they proceeded to serve us up with two *free* hand rolls and delicious green tea ice cream! I will definitely be back!",5
8011,"Just left here and I was so impressed I just had to write a review. First their prices are beyond reasonable. I had a blood orange margarita that was excellent. Not too sweet,  not too sour, it was perfect. Chilaquiles was so good. Everything tastes like Nana made it.  Horchata came out of a big agua fresca container dished out with a ladle like it should be. Place is legit. $1 taco tues! Clean and super cute dia de los muertos style decor. Love this place! This will be our new fave for sure.",5
8013,My laptop was having issues. Called FCR and Brandon came to my home. Checked it out the same day I called. I have a older laptop so he installed and formatted a new hard drive. Computer is now up and running like new. Very informative and seems very honest and trustworthy.,5
8016,"My Florist Cafe is misunderstood - by nearly everyone. Living in Phoenix you get used to how things are. If you own a food spot, it's either a coffee shop, a bar, or restaurant. Much like the clear zoning lines between residential and commercial, Phoenix food spots are either this or that, and rarely allowed to be anything else - it would be too confusing.


So while the complaints about My Florist cover a variety of subjects from the lousy menu, the lousy food, and the lousy service, it's only compounded by the fact that when you enter My Florist, you're expecting to enter an actual restaurant. Someplace you can get hot food, drinks and listen to jazz music while sitting there pretending you're in a completely different city. One that's more metropolitan, one that's more urban and cool, one that doesn't shut down at 10 o'clock.

My Florist Cafe fails, consistently and miserably. Oddly, years of bad service, bad food, and surprisingly boring bread haven't stopped people from giving this place a chance. Over and over again.

Sure they have one of the best jazz pianists in all of Phoenix (at least that you can find easily without having to be in any sort of music circles), but is that really enough? With the servers dressed up, disappearing regularly and delivering plates full of hard, nearly unedible bread, while having no knowledge at all about any of the wines they're suggesting, why do people continue to frequent this place?

I think our expectations are too high. Take away the bad service, don't expect too much out of the food, disregard any of the servers suggestions regarding wine and what do you have? Probably one of the more unique atmospheres you can find in Phoenix. For the price and the location, there really isn't anything like the ambiance you'll get at My Florist Cafe.

With an upscale decor, enough tables to comfortably fit a small group, the jazz piano in the background and the hum of coversation filling the room, I would dare say that there isn't anything like this anywhere else in Phoenix. Sure there are different places to go such as Chez Nous, but comparing the two would be wrong. Where Chez Nous is a great, dark, soulful R&B lounge, My Florists is excellently open and bright.

However, in the end My Florist Cafe has spent years and years unchanged. You can only say a restaurant could be so much more for so long. After a while, you decide to give up on it. You decide that it really won't change. You decide that for some unknown reason, the servers are different every week and so are their managers - but at least the woman playing piano can generally be counted on.

My advice? Try My Florist once a year. Don't order any food, and definitely don't order any bread. Bring some friends, order a bottle of wine of your own choosing, not the server's suggestions, and have a great time in one of Phoenix's few unique cafes.",1
8017,"The reason why I give this place 5 stars is because our server was amazing. She was very sweet, nice, and understanding. Not only was she checking in on us frequently, she even gave the best suggestions for the food as well. We got the meatballs, tomato basil soup, and the New York pizza. Her name was Naz, I believe, very kinda and beautiful! I will go here again and again if you continue to have people just like her! Thank you again Naz!!",5
8019,Matthew McGregor was incredibly helpful. He made my experience of the free truck service smooth and easy.

8022,"Five stars don't cut it for this restaurant. This place is crack. They lure you in with their amazingly cheap prices and you get the biggest trip of your life.
I tend to walk around my chair when I get a dish that is tasty, well here, I walked around the bar... TWICE!

I went for lunch and they have this great deal for a prix-fix for $25. Choice of three appetizers, 3 entrees and 2 dessert. The fact that I'm writing this review after the entree, means that I know dessert is going to be stellar.

I started with the prosciutto which was accompanied with a burrata which was to die for. Very creamy served at the right temperature.

The entree I went for basil ravioli. I don't know what it was filled with, but I do know that I cleaned my plate... The sauce, the filling, everything was just great.

Now I just did my third lap around the bar after I tasted my tiramisu. Light and delicious, perfectly balanced.

Did I mention everything is dirt cheap compared to other ""good"" restaurants in Vegas? Prosecco for $9, all entrees below $30.

Sherlynn was a great bartender. Easy to talk to, sweet and on point

For a moment, you think your no longer in a mall, but it brings your senses to Italy. They should change the interior and music a little to match the Italian lifestyle",5

Also good tip. Get there earlier if you want a good choice if desserts to take home.",5
8025,I was stuck in the drive through today for 20 minutes. Unacceptable. I've been to this location 5 times and every time the service was extremely slow as well as having errors with my order. I know this is an entry level job but I feel this location needs to fire everyone and start from scratch with people that have the experience and ability to handle the flow of customers. This location happens to have a Starbucks right across the street that easily does the same amount of business if not more and doesn't have any issues with speed or efficiency. It's pretty bad when you can't get a cup of coffee right. It goes beyond screwing the pooch to the level of effing the whole pound.,1

8028,"Tried this place for the first time today. 

It's in a rather obscure place - inside an office building in kind of an out-of-the-way place behind Scottsdale Airpark, but it's obvious they have quite the following.

The place is small and cute - very quaint. There is a wide variety of their baked goods on display to tempt your eyes.

My colleagues and I all got the same sandwich: the Chicken Salad on Croissant. It was fantastic! The chicken salad had nuts and cranberries in it and a little heat in the background. The apple slaw was very delicious. My colleagues both had the cowboy beans and both loved them.

We each got a sweet treat to enjoy later... some of those baked goods on display. I really enjoyed my brownie.

It's a small place that will be very hard to get into in short order. So get there while you can!

The food was a little expensive, but I'm perfectly OK paying a little more for great food that was lovingly prepared by a locally owned business. The money I paid will stay in the community rather than some corporate fatcat back east. We will definitely be back!",5

8036,"I have been going to MedShape for years. Whenever I need an extra boost to lose those 10 or so pounds, I go here. But, the past few visits have been very unpleasant. When I first signed up, it was particularly because of the ""no judgment zone"" and the encouragement. But, I have seen Amber multiple times and she is a complete waste of my time and has judged me every time. 
I asked the front desk to put on my file to never have her ""see/judge"" me and the front desk lady said that's very common. If it's very common, why hasn't management done anything? If they have, it's not working. I miss the girls that were here a couple years ago as they were very encouraging and helped you lose the weight that you needed to. In addition, Kelly is probably the most awesome person.

At the moment, until Amber is gone, I have to rate this place a 1 star because of her lack of customer service. She TALKS so much I want to tell her to just STFU.",1

Everyone was friendly and Irish in this joint, and the smell of the food was mouth watering.  I had the Lamb/Rosemary burger and by-gum it was one of the tastiest burgers EVER.  Lei enjoyed the fish and chips which were hands down the best I have EVER had.  The 21 year old whisky was the icing on this beautiful cake and I will return there in the very near future.

8046,"I didn't use these guys for my care through pregnancy as I was planning a home birth, but things didn't go as hoped and I ended up being transferred to Banner Del Webb hospital to be induced. 
Yvonne Downs, the midwife that works here and at the hospital, was AMAZING through it all. She was so kind and compassionate and I truly think her hard work saved me from a c-section when my little dude's heart rate started dropping during contractions. She was sympathetic towards the fact that I had planned to have him at home and made me as comfortable as possible with the transition. Even though I'm pretty sure I said ""Man, you're bossy!"" When it came time to push and she kept making me change positions to help the baby's heart rate, she was amazing and made the whole experience as good as it possibly could have been. 
I don't know about the rest of staff here, but I would definitely consider seeing Yvonne in the future if I have another one!",5

8049,"At Bannock -we had the most amazing waiter in the world!!!! This guy could make mud pies sound delectable- serious talent. Also- food was awesome and I officialy love Bannock (well, the food I mean).

We didn't know what Bannock was, but they were happy to describe it. An eggless flat bread I believe. Great place for vegetarians. They have a few awesome dish options for veggies including the 'gnocchi bolegnese' made with mushrooms. MMMMM!!! My boyfriend had the chicken brick, something with layers, and said it was DELISH! Dessert was yummy too!

Only suggestion would be to dim the lights for dinner- it was a bit too bright! Maybe not the most romantic ambiance- but I can overlook that and say it was an experience I will surely never forget.

I think the waiter's name was Marcel- ask for Marcel!!  And, give him a huge tip!",5

Make sure you try the shawarma if you have never had it before, its absolutely amazing and you will become hooked at first bite! It is kind of pricey $10-$15 a person, so if you are on a $5 footlong budget, you may be sticker shocked...  But the quality is great!",5

8059,"Waste of time coming here for lunch!  Came in with three co-workers on our lunch break and service was horrific!  We immediately asked for extra bean dip.  Our waitress, Stephanie, took our drink order and said she'd be back to take our food orders even tho we were ready to order right then.  She proceeded to go behind the bar and make some drinks and ring some orders and check on other customers.  She finally came back with our drinks but no bean dip.  We waited and waited and waited for her to come take our orders and finally had to ask to get someone else to serve us.  This turned out to be the manager.  We had ordered four lunch specials and one to go.  After waiting some more she came back and said we could get the to go order only at full price so we declined.  We finally got more chips and salsa from our original waitress who brought two of everything even attitude.  By this time we had been waiting for at least 30 min since the manager had supposedly put our order in.  We got up and asked for the manager again since at this point we were running late for work.  She's nowhere to be found until we get up to leave.  She comes out with our food as we're half way out the door saying ""they tried their best""!  No apology.  She offered to box it up but for what full price since the special is full price to go!? No thanks cuz they probably spit in it anyway!",1

And you find that the prescription the doctor called in for you four hours before isn't ready yet?  Didn't even say it nicely.  Rude people who could care less about what they're doing.

Today I had the Joes scramble with sausage instead of hamburger. Again fantastic. My kids did not want to come here because they don't like eggs, but I made them:)

Look at my papers and the account and routing number on my federal is wrong. Weird it was correct under my state but completely different when there's a large amount of money involved? I go in they tell me some bull shit lie, the next day I get a call saying their bank has my refund check I call back to see why the fuck it isn't being deposited to my account or mailed to my address on file & they tell me there is no file for me that I am not a client. Why my refund wasn't deposited to my account like we had set up in the first place is beyond me. I go in today & the guy helping me has the nerve to question if I'm lying about not receiving my refund. He tells me he needs time to work on my case. Of course it's not their money that's missing so they take their sweet time. I have never been so unhappy with a company or had this many problems when filing my taxes.

Pizza was just ""so-so"".  Not sure if it would have been better warm or even hot, we didn't have a chance to try it that way.

8080,"I read several reviews on here before going to try the breakfast buffet on Sunday. The whole process to pay and be seated was horrible and staff was rude. I should have left then. At 10am they started to put up the breakfast items, which was strange for brunch. Mimosas were so disgusting. They did have a small omelet station with 4 pans. The chef was only making one omelet to completion before starting another. Several angry people in line. Desserts were all stale and even the ice cream was runny and tasteless. I could not even put it in the sugar cones. This experience should have foreshadowed the food poisoning I got. By 3 o'clock I had to lay down and did not wake up till 10pm to be physically ill. This was all that I had eaten and I washed my hands/ used hand sanitizer after playing machines. Bad service, bad choices and selection, poor quality, and the food makes you sick. Avoid! No buffet should be able to ruin breakfast. Attaching a pic of my burnt french toast.",1

8084,"Da Bearse! When I was on the road (1985-2005) I would do my best to enjoy the local foods that a particular city was famous for. ""Phiily"" Cheese steak, pizza in Brooklyn, and Salmon in Idaho. My all time favorite ""local"" treat is the ""Italian Sandwich"" Chicago style. Hot dogs are fine, but you can find great hot dogs anywhere. I go for the things that you cannot find just anywhere. Over the years I traveled, I grew very fond of the Cicago style ""Italian beef"" sandwich. There were hundreds of restaurants in and around Chicago, mostly small ""Mom n' Pop"" operations. It never mattered as long as the food was great. Matt's Chicago Dog in Charlotte and Cornelius might as well have ""teleported"" Italian beef sandwiches that taste like they MUST be made in Chicago. Down here we don't have a big ""Vienna Beef"" restaurant like ""Photos Hot Dogs"" in Palatine, but we have ""Matt's Chicago Dog"". All they need is ""Old Style"" on tap and a signed photograph from Ernie Banks and BOOM just like that- you're in Chicago! I never had a bad meal at Matt's, or any of those places in Chicagoland. Thanks to the family for bringing a tasty piece of Chicago to our town.",5
8085,"Easter Weekend - 2011

I read quite a few review you have to get there early. I guess when we went we got lucky. Didn't have to wait that long may be about 5 mins for the guy to clean the table. 

As soon as you walk in you can hear the music blasting. Let put it this way you can call this a day club. They were playing way better music then most club in Toronto. The setting of the restaurant was pretty cool. My girl friend and me look at each other and said this will be a hit on King West in Toronto. 

Anyway, if you don't know by now. This Restaurant is located on the French side of Montreal. Don't expect menu etc to be in English. The server know enough English to take your order or just point Haha  :-)

The Food was GREAT. My girl friend had some fruit juice and some yogurt fruit meal. I had some chicken egg benedict. It was AWESOME. Might be little spicy for some. But perfect for me. They had a bar there. Beside serving fruit juice I think they guy was serving booze too. LOL talk about those party frenchie. 

Don't expect to get 3.99 for breakfast special here :-) For two of us I think the bill came up to be around $40.00 with tips. Its worth it. If you around this neighbourhood in MTL. You should stop by.

8094,"I'm a fan of the flame broiled whopper, and I am a fan of Burger Kings coupons but I typically don't eat fast food. But I happen to get some coupons in the mail and Saturday is my ""cheat"" day so I said why not. I could go on my lunch break I work on Saturday's and this location is right down the street from my office. 

So on 3/14/15 12:43pm I get a 30 minute lunch break and I tell myself me and another co-worker will go. To say the least I was not happy with most of this experience. Let me go over the negatives, because the positives are listed above. 

1. The restaurant was dirty. The counter was dirty, tables were dirty, the soda machine was dirty, the condiment area was dirty. I don' know what drive thru looked like because I went inside, but I will say there was only one group of people sitting down and only about 6 people in line in front of me...dirty is gross.

2. It took forever for the check out girl to ring every one up, she kept asking for assistance, or was just generally joking with her coworkers...took me 5 minutes to get there, stood in line for 10 minutes...I finally get to order. MY BREAK IS HALF OVER. 

3. I order. I had a coupon for two original chicken sandwiches and two small fry for $4.99, not a bad deal, didn't feel like a burger that day. I wait. I get it for there...I figure I can get it and sit and eat real fast and wont have to go back to work and eat at my desk.  I watch as my order clock goes up to 9 minutes. FML. Then when my order is up I spend another three minutes looking at it sit under the heat lamps while the staff talks amongst themselves and works on drive thru orders that came in after mine. Finally its put on a tray and given to me. I ask for a cup for water, the girl didn't hear me because she is not paying attention, I ask again, she looks it me like its a hassle to hand me a clear plastic cup for water...I am getting extremely frustrated. 

My break is effectively over. 

4. I finally get my food. The french fries were good. But how can you fuck up french fries??? The chicken tasted like it was freezer burnt, it was gross. 

So after effectively wasting a good 25 minutes I actually get my food after walking in the front door of this Burger King. 
I used my entire break and went back to work extremely late. 

Worst so called FAST FOOD experience ever. 

I will never go back to this location. And I threw out the rest of the coupons I had.",1
8095,"We have had Sun Bright Pool service come out on several occasions to repair our pool equipment, through our Home Warranty company. They are terrific, to say the least.

This past week Jerry came out and serviced the pool pump.  He called me when he was done, explained what he did and wanted to verify that there were no other problems we wanted him to check.

I have, on many occasions, gone out of my way to stop in QT over other gas stations, because not only are they much much nicer, but they are very clean and offer a ton of gas station fare (drinks, shakes, coffees, juices, snacks, etc).  I really appreciate how quickly they work, with cashier's that are able to take care of two customers at once.  I usually abhor using gas station bathrooms because, let's face it, we've all been there and seen how putrid they can be, but whenever I visit QT they are always clean! They mop, sweep, clean the bathrooms, windex the doors...and for that I applaud you all, thanks for the cleanliness:D",5

Most of the merchandise is not priced, so you have to take every item to the front so the lady can tell you how much it is. I asked for the price on one item and she had to look it up online (probably eBay). Mostly everything was overpriced. I was interested in a seashell but it was $20!

The chicken was dry and crusty in the teriyaki chicken  and udon noodles as though it had been cooked and left to sit for hours. The sauces were lacking flavor.

Now let's talk food.... they make their smoked salmon in/house and it literally melted in my mouth. I think that was the best bagel and lox I've ever had! We also ordered the raspberry croissant bread pudding with whiskey sauce, and just wow.

Apparently they recently started serving brunch and I'm so glad I discovered it. Can't wait to go back to try dinner!!",5

On a recent visit I enjoyed my Caesar salad that had a wonderful dressing which they make themselves! It had a little bite to it which was the perfect compliment to dish that you can't really rave about.
The star of the show was hubby's pasta Bianca dish which was fresh and well seasoned. The prices are reasonable making this a solid dining experience.
Join their mobile rewards for points and be sure to check on yelp for check in specials.

8134,"BLUF: Try it for dessert. it's a neat experience. Sit at the bar and take it all in.

This was my first time trying a fancy dessert place. I was a little hesitant seeing the prices, but decided to try it anyway. It's advertised as a an enjoyable Japanese/French style dessert place and it definitely delivers.

There's not much parking here, but we found a spot quickly. The area doesn't look like it would house such a fancy place, but I guess that's where the hidden in hidden gem comes from.

We waited for 2-3 minutes to be seated and sat at the bar. Seating was a bit tight. It takes a little while for someone to come by and take your order but we just watched the desserts being made. This is was honestly a big part of why I liked this place so much. It was fascinating to watch everything being made and all the steps that went into each dessert. 

Food:

I got the raspberry sorbet and ichigo. The raspberry sorbet was so packed full of flavor it was amazing. The ichigo was delicious and is something I would gladly get again. 

Price:

The desserts are on the pricey side, though I think you do get your money's worth for the experience along with the food. They do have a one main dessert per person minimum, so be mindful of this if you're thinking of coming. 

Service:

Everyone was really nice and very courteous. They observe some traditional Japanese customs (greetings and things they say when they leave a room) which created a nice fun environment.",5
8141,"What a great company to handle all your HVAC needs.

Backstory: Our A/C stopped blowing cold air on Tuesday night. We called in to a popular HVAC company to get a recharge of freon. The inspection pointed to a leak in the evap coil. Called home warranty company, was given several horrid companies to do the work. Did a Google search and STB came up as the top rated result in the Gilbert area. Thankfully, we were able to choose our own contractor for the job!

Called and spoke with Ashley, who is AMAZING at ensuring you are treated like royalty, is very knowledgable, and answers all my crazy OCD questions (and should receive a raise! ;)) She told me someone will return my call with an estimate. Ryan, who is equally amazing, called back almost immediately and sent me an estimate within twelve hours. He then came out after business hours to do a second diagnosis inspection. (Ryan also deserves a raise! ;)) It turns out it, in fact, IS the evap coil leaking.

The next morning, I get a call at 7:30am saying that the installers will be there at 8:00am. Danny shows up and expediently gets to work, removing the offending coil. Dean shows up a little while later with the new coil to replace it. (Again, Danny and Dean deserve a raise for working in the hot attic for a couple hours!) The install went well and both were very efficient in doing their work. They were also very friendly, which is refreshing to see with installers!

Additionally, Ashley helped setup the communications between STB and my home warranty company, which was really appreciated, as I was getting a bit annoyed by said warranty company at that point...

Overall, I will say that because of the above and beyond service I received from Ashley, Ryan, Danny, and Dean, I will not hesitate to call them for any future HVAC needs. I recommend them whole-heartedly!",5

My kitchen sink was also moving at the base because a part was broken, he told me to call Delta and they would send me a new part free of charge and he would come back out to install it.  The new part arrived and I called Joe and he came back out and fixed it. 

I will be referring all my friends and family to Joe from now on!  Thank you Joe for the excellent job!

Even though Poutineville was only half a mile away from our hotel, I was seriously considering if it was worth it having to walk 10 minutes in a snow storm to eat here. I may have gotten a little bit sick, but all I have to say is that I have no regrets. I was never ever a fan of carbs, of cheese, or anything that this place would stand for, but somehow, Poutineville converted me. 

I opted for the make-your-own-poutine menu, since I was all about having it my own way. It starts at 8-9 dollars, and you work your way up depending on how much stuff you decide to put in your poutine. From what I can recall, I added mushrooms, hot dog, bell peppers, gravy, runny egg, and some other options that I don't even remember. I ended up with about 10 additional items on top, which totaled up to about $19 just for that one dish. That sounds like a lot, but when the dish was served to us, it all made sense; it was huge!  It was like 2 days worth of food for me and my boyfriend, no way I would be able to finish that in one sitting. After eating through 1/4 of it, we decided to pack it up and enjoy it later.

I wish I was able to explain how good my customized poutine was. Yeah the flavors didn't really match, but I devoured it nevertheless. I especially enjoyed the cheese curds, and I'm not even a fan of cheese. The service was quick and the drink selection was adequate. If I ever find myself in Montreal again, you can almost guarantee that this will be the first place I will stop by at.",5
8153,I rarely leave reviews but this time it's warranted. 2 guys were sitting at the bar n I'm assuming she was one of the managers but she was behind the bar helping the bartender. These guys were a holes to her. Very rude and snippy. She interacted in a very brief exchange with us. Not even a minute into it these guys interrupted snapping at her for a water. She apologized and was very civil but they continued to berate her. Kudos to her for keeping her cool n a smile on her face.,5
8154,"I'm not the type to write a negative review of a restaurant. But, I feel the need to warn people not to waste their time or money at this restaurant. Ate there tonight. The service was unbelievably slow. The food was bland, the dressing was watered down, and the sauce clearly came from a can.",1
8155,Great store with excellent selection and service! Always happy to come in and get all my livestock from these guys!,5
8157,"I got to Danny's on HIghland at 9am on a Saturday in February 2013, and they were already super busy. If you are crunched for time don't go to Danny's. It's like going to Walmart: it's a time warp. 

I wanted  a wash and detail. I figured I'd spend about $50-$75. However, the salesman suggested I get my yellowed, hazy headlight housing cleaned up (which is desperately needed); exterior wash; wax; interior shampoo; and detailing both inside and out. He said that getting the works all at once would be more cost effective for everyone than paying for everything a la carte. According to their advertised pricing, that's accurate. Then he gave me a discount on this package. 

I then asked him how much this deal would cost me. He replied $250. My jaw hit the parking lot. Yikes! I'd gotten the same quote from TOYOTA for the same service sans headlights. I honestly figured Danny's would be cheaper since it's an assembly line and not a Toyota dealership. I was wrong. I guess customers are paying for convenience since Toyota told me I'd have to drop it off early in the morning for all dang day and come back late afternoon or evening for pick-up. That was without the headlights figure din. 

Then I asked how long it would take. The estimate was 3 hours. ""Well, choot,"" I thought. ""When will I ever get a full exterior & interior detail with headlight housing restoration?"" So, I did it. I broke down and signed away $250 for the works--which included, without my full blessing, cleaning under the hood. My car hadn't been cleaned in 17 months and it sure needed it. 

The 3 hour estimate was accurate and I simply walked across the street to the shopping plaza to entertain myself with window shopping and an early lunch. When Danny's called my cell, I walked over and paid. Unfortunately, you can't leave a tip on the card and I had no cash for the attendant. I don't even know how many people worked on my car -or- if it was just one person hustling for the tip. ???????? 

My only complaint is that the tree sap on my car never came off. In my experience, you have to use rubbing alcohol to get the crap off even though it is supposedly bad for your paint. I wish I had removed the sap myself BEFORE going to Danny's but, if you recall, I was only preparing for a simple wash and detail. I definitely got up-sold but my car needed it, and I consented, so I can't complain. My car looked and smelled so much better when I left. It's been 3 months and it still looks great.",5
8159,Stepped into this place and it was quite interesting. Wasn't sure if they sold coffee at 1st. The baristas were  really friendly and had some good conversations with them.   I ordered a Raspberry Truffle Frappe and it was quite delicious and blended quite well. They also offered another customer and I free smoothie samples.  This little cafe is a good place to hangout and get some coffee or dessert if you happen to go to court or in the downtown area! This place definitely has some moxie.,5

I took a suit in that was not new (had been dry cleaned a few times) that had no problems.  When I wore it after picking it up, i noticed a horrible double crease on both pant legs.  Making it worse was I realized this after leaving home and had to wear the pants that way all day!  I took it back to them and told them to fix the crease.  When I picked the pants up the double crease was still there despite having asked them to fix it.  When I asked time to fix the crease, they said they could not and did not even offer to try.  They blamed the suit for the double crease but it was fine BEFORE they ruined it.  

Incompetence and sloth....you have been warned.",1

8163,"We were hopeful that this organization would be able to help with some simple obedience training for our Greyhounds.  Sadly they had done zero research and showed up with an insistence to use a choker chain.  I know when used properly they can be a good training aid, however with a greyhounds sensitive neck it did not seem necessary.  Our male greyhound bared his teeth at the trainer which he said was normal.  That was our free lesson.  

On my own I had both of our hounds able to sit, down and stay using just our martingale collar and a little patience within one week.   

Please be certain they have learned about your breed before buying a package.",1
8164,"With a narrow yet tasty selection of choices, Burritoville offers a healthy ""home-made"" alternative to the ""sandwich"" places found in this sector of the city. They have 3 to 4 options for each of their mains (burito, tacos, and quesadilla) and a few choices for your side if you chose to take your meal in a combo. Their home made salsa and chips are very good and aren't given enough credit.

There is room to eat there or you can always take your food to go AND it comes in biodegradable containers (win win!)


I've eaten here more than a few times and will continue to.

Staff is really nice as well (which is always a + in my book)

EDIT :  Went back again last night... Wow, this place is delicious!",5
8165,"So amazing! Their salad, breadsticks and their Asiago Garlic Alfredo with chicken meatballs! Mmmmmm not the healthiest but I ate every last bite.

I highly recommend Infuze.",5
8169,"Dr. Lele is the consummate professional. She took the time to evaluate my particular situation and counsel me on the best method of treatment, even though it resulted in her not being able to charge me for the expensive procedure of LASIK.

I would highly recommend her to anyone considering LASIK or any other treatment because she obviously has integrity and puts her patients' well-being above making a buck.

Her office staff and assistant were great as well.",5
8172,"So of course Hachi was on our ""must-return"" list on our latest trip to Vegas. We actually ended up going two nights in a row! We ate at the restaurant Monday night, and then ended up doing to-go Tuesday night after seeing ""Ka"" at the MGM. Yep, in spite of the vast array of choices at the MGM, we went back to Hachi for take-out. And the waitresses remembered us from the night before. Of course we had to order the crispy chips (a/k/a deep fried chicken skin!) and the grilled homemade chashu. The husband is obsessed with this dish! We ordered two orders of the grilled chashu Monday night, AND Tues. night! Also tried the stir-fried pork belly with kimchi, which was damn good. The kimchi was not overly spicy, yet had all the flavors you'd expect.

Thank you Hachi for two more awesome dinners!  Service, as usual, was spot on. 

Oh, when we dined at the restaurant Monday night, the chef was awesome! I'd hear him say ""Delicious!"" and then ""Table 7!"" I asked our waitress if we were seated at table 7 and she said ""Yes, why do you ask?"" And I told her what I heard the chef say and she laughed. Glad to see people enjoying their work. But then, when your job is to feed such yummy delicious awesome food to people, how could you not enjoy your job?? 

Can't wait to come back!!",5
8175,"I got a really great haircut with Brannon.  I like that he knew what I'd want before I even told him.  Very friendly and chill place.  To get Brannon himself to cut your hair is like 10 extra dollars, and worth every penny I think.  I've never got a cut by the guy whose name is on the salon before.  Frederic Fekkai isn't often hanging around his salons, y'know?",5
8180,"Going to Applebee's after work for happy hour seemed like a good decision. I remember loving the Orlando location by my former university. I came here with the intentions of a 1 to 2 hour meal with a few co-workers. However, this turned into closer to a 3 hour experience due to slow service. I got the boneless hot wings and the wanton chicken tacos. I am pretty sure the hot wings were straight from a freezer because of the texture of the breading. The quality of the food I had from the happy hour menu was not too great, and thankfully I only paid happy hour prices. My happy hour margarita was just okay. The worst part was the service. The waiter stopped by our table only occasionally and walked off a few different times before taking the entire party's order. 

     At the end, when it came time for me to cash out, the waiter brought our checks out with the orders not separated right. This wouldn't be a problem, if the following did not occur. The waiter went to go make the needed corrections, but then she comes back 15 minutes later and tells us to use the touch pad to pay on the table. There is a touchpad available, but no-one explains how to use it. At this point, other than to bring the food, the wait staff would be better replaced by the touch pad anyways. 

    Will I come back? Only if it's my co-workers birthday and they choose to go to this place. However, I would never choose to come here when the decision is solely in my hand.",1

8188,"Since recently moving into the Downtown/Central Phoenix area, my boyfriend and I have been trying new restaurants every chance we get. There are so many great places around here, but I felt like we hadn't been anywhere super impressive until we came to The Parlor :) 

A friend of a friend had recommended this spot as one of their favorites, and I'm so glad we took that advice, as we don't choose Italian/pizza restaurants as often as others. For an appetizer, we ordered the Fritto Misto (crispy calamari & shrimp), and it was delicious. Perfectly cooked, and a great portion size as well. We also ordered the Pepperoni pizza for dinner, and it was one of the best pizzas I've had in forever! Huge pepperonis, and yummy chunks of mozzarella all over (I wish I had photos but I was trying to play it cool lol).

In addition to the food I thought the atmosphere was great, The Parlor is a very pretty restaurant! We sat on the patio and I loved it. Our waiter was great as well, he even brought me a sample of a beer he thought I would like when the one I asked for turned out to be no longer available. My one piece of advice would maybe be to skip the drinks all together, though - I thought the food was well priced, but drinks were very expensive so we could have cut our bill in half by just sticking to food!",5

8192,Two thumbs up to ACA! I had them out for my semi-annual checkup after being recommended to by a neighbor. It was very apparent that the gentleman who came out knew what he was doing. When done he gave us an understandable explanation of things that we'd need to keep our eye on for in the future and didn't try to sell me anything i didn't need! My husband was even pleased and thats a rare occurance! LOL We signed up for their 'energy savings aggreement' which my neighbor had also recommended which will be nice having them call us in the fall and will take another thing off my to-do list! thank you ACA i look forward to having you out in the fall and will recommend you to others in need!,5

Terrible service and unfriendly staff!

I don't see the point of going back, I strongly recommend that you find a better spot for your sharpening needs.",1

8203,"Where to start? I went to a big box store because they advertised Free Installation! Free Stairs! Free! Free! Free! Got the quote back and it was over $11,000. (We have a big house). Feeling slightly defeated, I went into Brandi Carpet. Chris was amazing. He *really* knows his carpet. I picked out one I liked and he scheduled the measurement. Just as Chris thought, the big box over-measured by 30 square yards, which added up to about $1k before taxes. Got an estimate back from Chris that was more than $3,000 less. He scheduled me, told me who would install the carpet and when. They just finished yesterday and the house looks AMAZING. The installers were so awesome. I couldn't be more happy with the outcome and I'm ridiculously happy that I supported small business vs a big corporation. Thanks, Chris!",5
8204,"I thought I was going to love this hotel,and it has been a disaster of a trip to say the least . For starters they didn't give us the room we asked for ,they put us (a couple)into 2 queen beds, but the water pressure in the room didn't work and neither did the tv. We ordered room service a couple times and couldn't even get a hot meal,or ever what we ordered and it got to the point that a simple waffle was too much for them. On Friday I called down to have the TV fixed and the water pressure fixed and by Sunday afternoon nothing had been done. I then went to the front desk where a ""manager "" named Sara and I user the term manager loosely proceeded to tell me that after all that we are going to comp the food. (The food that I couldn't eat because it wasn't cooked )Or I can give you a $50 credit . She was extremely condescending and I explained to her you are charging me $270 a night and I have even extended my stay and all you can do is give me a $50 credit and still not fix anything ? She basically told me ,to take and moved me on my way. I was willing to give this hotel a second try until I met Sara and her condescending attitude and I think establishments especially in Las Vegas need to understand that customer service should be the foremost important thing. Sadly this weekend in Las Vegas at the Aria dealing with Sara it wasn't the case. I guess I will be headed back to The Wynn or The Venetian next time I am here . Disappointed Aria ,very Disappointed",1
8205,"The Shvitz is a Jewish tradition in Cleveland that has been discovered by guys of all stripes.  It's great.
Years ago they had a ladies night once a week, but in this day and age no woman would step inside.  The place has been there forever and looks it.  I understand that now days you get a lock to use that is private.  It used to be that one communal key opened all the locks on the lockers.  They also have an armed guard in the parking lot and plenty of cops as customers.
My routine was to take a shvitz and a playtzeh in the steam room.  (It is NOT a sauna -- it is very wet heat).  When I came out I avoided the pool of ice water because I think it's the same water my grandfather dipped in - talk about a gene pool!  That water hasn't been changed since Bentske yorn.
After a shower, I retire to the cots wrapped in a sheet in the darkened locker room.  My buddies and I all grab a beer - Cincy cream ale is best - and kibitz on the cots in hushed tones for a while.  Some may catch a few zzzz.  It's also this time when a massage is a good idea.
After a nice rest, it's time to go into the kitchen for supper.  A juicy rib steak served on a wood plank and covered in garlic.  Add to that fresh rye bread with butter and a slice of pickled red pepper.  You want salad? - you get a nice slice of onion.  The appetizer is a slice of matjes herring - an acquired taste but one that I acquired as a small child.
Back in the days when Gay Solomon owned the Shvitz it always seemed to cost $28 no matter what I got.  Don't forget to tip the Playtzeh or the masseur.
The Shvitz is hard to find but it's a great trip back in time to 1920 or so.  Try it!",5
8207,"If you want real korean food, this place is not the place.  Service was poor and quality was poor.  Agree with some that other korean BBQ places wirh korean people there eating is a good sign of good korean food at a restuant.  No korean people present except myself at this place.

They charged us 18% tip atomic ally for 4 people. ?? A diet coke was $6 and one half Corn was $4 .  Not worth it at all.  Go to a real korean BBQ restaurant if u want authentic tic food and don't waste your time here.

Been to LA. New York and atlanta to name a few...and this was not even comparable to those restuarants.

I was impressed that Alex remembered the wine I liked considering I've only been there a couple of times.  Alex was our sever also so he's good at multi-tasking as well.  Owner Juan was there as always, when one owns a family business one works long hours I'm sure.  Complementary bread and oil was served at the bar to nosh on with our wine.  A little balsamic along w/a good flavored oil went well with the Pinot Gri and focaccia.
My bosses were in town and I knew from past experience that Juan would come through w/a great meal. Juan is a very friendly man. 
We split 2 salads easily enough for 4 people everything seemed fresh and dressed nicely not too heavy.
I had the Pollo Cannarella- a Chix breast picatta served over fettuccine in a lemon caper sauce with olives.  The flavor is outstanding just the right amount of tartness.  My girlfriend had the Risotto Mare E Terra.  Good seafood mixed with mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes in a vodka sauce that is not too heavy.  She does not like very rich dishes and this was a perfect fit for her. Risotto was cooked perfectly she said.  Bosses had a farfalle rustico w/a olive oil mushroom, other veg, garlic, parm and white wine sauce.  He said pasta was cooked perfect also and liked the dish a lot.  The other had a Penne Genovese w/chix and a basil pesto sauce topped w/a special tomato sauce.  Everyone commented that their meals were great.  Bosses both emailed me this am and thanked me for picking a nice restaurant and commented how much they enjoyed the meal.  They're fr/Chicago so they have their pick of good Italian restaurants so a nice compliment I thought.  I appreciated the fact that they bought dinner!
This honestly is a great restaurant with very friendly, attentive staff, great food and a variety of table types from cozy booths up front to more romantic secluded tables in the back.  It's a must go see and try.",5

8215,"We had tickets to the Michael Jackson Immortal Tour on Sunday night.  We arrived in a sea of people, went downstairs to will call and then BACK upstairs to get a drink.  Then we waited in a cattle call to get through three metal detectors.  There were thousands of people attempting to do this.  What A JOKE! The planning of this event was awful.  They didn't inform folks that there was food and drink inside.  As well, when the event was over, the Las Vegas Marathon ended right at the exit we HAD TO TAKE to get out of the event center and to and through a narrow walkway in the casino.  There were 44,000 persons added to the already 20000 plus who were exiting the show.  If there had been an emergency, there would have been no way to help a soul.  They are really lucky that nobody from the marathon was so tired that they passed out.  I am very disappointed in this terrible planning.  It took us an hour to get to the front door of the casino/hotel.  And, then we had to take an overcrowded tram to another hotel.  It certainly is not designed for 50 people, but up to 50 were jam packed in.  We are lucky we didn't roll off the track.  What idiots.",1

8220,"I was going to write a very mean review of this company because I felt lied to and almost duped. I came very close to believing what they were saying and giving them some of my hard-earned money. After further consideration, I realized that it isn't their fault that they are just confused and don't know the true meaning of the word ""free.""  It all started like this:
I received several calls from a lady asking if I could attend a presentation which in exchange I would receive a ""free"" $2000 travel voucher for just attending. . Still suspicious, I asked the nice lady on the phone several times how long the presentation would last, what we were required to take, and what we (my fianc√© and I) would receive. She stuck to her story of it costing us nothing, we could leave after the 90 minute presentation, and that the gifts were ours to keep with no ties involved. There was some discussion between my fianc√© and I about when could go. We decided to attend their Saturday mid-morning presentation (Ok, I know. I sounded too good to be true, and I should have been wiser. I'm sorry for being optimistic. I often think that humans have good intentions.)
Well, we showed up 15 minutes early for our appointment on the 3rd floor of the Jockey Club as instructed. 30 minutes later an older gentleman led us to room where we were shown an infomercial and given a kind of motivational speech about how Geo Holidays does not have pressure salesmen. The main speaker scribbled many numbers on a white board in no particular order. We listened to the speech and watched the film, then were led to some rooms that ""are just like what you would be investing in."" From there we were led to an open room with several round tables. The older gentleman called over a decent guy named Jim. Jim asked if we were ready to invest. When we said it was too much for us at the moment, he offered us ""a special low price for locals."" The way it was presented, it was kind of appealing, but we stuck to our self-made pre-presentation goal not to buy anything. So again we said we weren't ready to purchase anything at that time. Jim left us so we could talk about his added bonus of a ""free"" four day three night stay in Disneyland which he would include ""only if we invested today.""  Then he returned with a property that was just put up for sale at a bargain price because the previous owner was in the Navy and was relocated out of the country. Again said very politely said  ""no thanks. We aren't ready to invest today,"" Jim left saying he was going to get the guy to give us our gift. This time a gentleman of few words named Jonny showed up and in broken English and even worse writing and number scribbling tried one last time to sell us whatever they were selling.
By this point, we were annoyed, frustrated, and tired of sitting listening to people talk to us, and not listening to what we were saying. When I asked about our free gift Jonny said ""I'll go get it and be right back.""  We watched Jonny walk away and sit at a different table. Queue Vinny(?) I'm going to refer to this poorly nutritioned highly tattooed man as Vinny because he didn't have a name badge and did not introduce himself to us. Kindness was not his forte. Rudeness and shortness were two character traits which he possessed quite a bit of.  Vinny again wrote some numbers, mumbled some stuff about something, and then offered us our ""free"" gift. This ""free"" $2000 travel voucher requires you to pay $199 per person and travel Tuesday through Sunday of certain weeks. You can choose a cruise, a hotel in Hawaii, or some time in Disneyland. Airfare, taxes, and reservation fees were not included.
The ""free"" tickets were to shows that required at least a two drink minimum. So, you can walk in and sit for no money, but to stay you must give someone money.
In conclusion, obviously the Geo Holidays people don't know what FREE means. You can't be upset at someone if they are confused or weren't taught correctly. But, if they were taught correctly, and they do know what free actually means, then those people are liars and untrustworthy.
Fellow Yelpers, you have been warned. Talk to them at your own risk. And for your information, thefreedictionary.com (which I paid nothing to use) defines ""free"" as a.-Costing nothing; gratuitous.
Geo Holidays I hope that you learned what ""free"" means from me for free.",1
8221,"Lack of service from the short hair bartender tonight at around 11:15pm. She even yelled at 2 customers for not tipping to her likening as they were exiting the bar

So originally I was at Buffalo Wild Wings to catch some sports when I became hungry and decided to not have their wings, but to come to BAR and enjoy their wings instead because they're amazing. Once we arrived, we were immediately greeted by the bartender and served our 1st round of beers and then it was left at that. 

The place wasn't busy at all but the bartender made sure to pay attention to certain players. She never showed equal service to all of her guests and we were never able to put any food order in or even a 2nd round of drinks so we decided to leave and take our gaming business elsewhere.

I have a lot of respect for BAR as their ambiance is great and their food menu is outstanding but the service definitely lacks. In my 18 year hospitality experience, if the customer service fails to even meet minimum requirements, then they represent the company in a poor way. A little good service can go a long way or better service can keep the business in a 5 Star rating.",1

Her cuts last and you don't wake up the next day saying, ""What have I done!"" She is friendly and takes her time with you. She made my color look natural and not brassy. I finally love my hair! She is genuinely concerned about the condition of your hair and taught me how to wash my hair the correct way. I get tons of complements now.",5
8223,"I love indoor soccer! It's so nice to take the kids to play inside and out of the elements of the desert. The facility is great with 2 fields, a snack bar, tables to sit, and other available activities. My kids have played at every level and gone to summer camps. The staff is energetic, kind, encouraging and professional. They emphasize fun and skills over cutthroat competition. It's exactly what I wanted for my kids soccer experience. And its a great place to watch - I dont have to bring a chair, umbrella, snacks or blankets. Win win.",5
8224,"Roughly the same menu as Babbo in NYC, which is one of my favorite restaurants.  I didn't find it particularly loud or salty or rude, as some of the previous reviewers mentioned.  I dined at the bar though.  The chef & sommelier were also eating at the bar (it was late), and they offered me a few bites of random things.  Was nice.  

I had the Mint Love Letters with Lamb Ragu.  Excellent as always.  And the Fennel Dusted Sweetbreads w/ Onion Jam and Duck Bacon.  Also, excellent.",5
8225,"I didn't expect to find such an authentic place in Pittsburgh. It is a very typical French bakery, something you don't expect to see in the middle of the country, really. The bread is done just right, all pastries are exactly what you would have found in France. No wonder that every time I stop by there is a line of people that goes out the door and into the street. Very much worth the wait!",5
8228,"I was violated an sexually harassed, mentally  an emotionally  abused by Tsa officers .After  a full body scan I was aked to step to the side, I had forgot to remove some lotion that set off a alarm.Me an my girlfriend steped to the side an laughed about it . Then a Offier Ruiz aproached me in a very intempting  mater  an ordered the other officer to search me again.I had on one white tee an shorts no belt or shoes they all had been removed my shorts where on my waist.Ruiz repeated my name overr 25 times in a intimanating  an belittleing matter.The officer  again  grabbed my penis  in a way that made me feel very uncomfortable  I even asked can you stop touching my penis. Officer  Ruiz intructed the other officer to check the gloves.Know I set off a second explosive  alarm bullshit! KNOW Iam in a back room getting touched again know by Officer  Ruiz he touched my penis like 20 times.My bag had already been cleared I could not understand why I was still standing there with spectators  looking taken picture.",1
8229,We loved Dig This.  Great for my company   When they come to town.   Thrill of a lifetime to be playing in  the dirt with bulldozers and excavators.  Well worth the money.,5
8230,"Usually have a decent experience here, but not tonight. I went there around dinner time, so you would think they would be ready with everything made right? Nope. We had to wait for many toppings to be re-stocked/ made. I.T took forever for them to make our food and we were the only ones in there. The workers seemed even annoyed that we were there. Also, I didn't even finish my burrito because the chicken looked and tasted weird.",1
8231,"Nick is the BEST piercer ever!! Amazing experience! I will definitely be back! He was very courteous and considerate and explained every step of the process as he went. It was almost completely pain free. Great job, great shop! Thank you guys!!",5
8233,"Moved to Henderson 10/12 (6 mo) and have been hunting for ""the"" Mexican place! Found it! Most excellent and authentic.",5
8234,"We went here based on all the positive reviews. I should have lowered my expectations. We ordered chips & guac and several 99 cent tacos (fish, beef & chicken). The tacos had a hard shell which I actually like and were topped with a TON of shredded lettuce and shredded cheddar cheese. I mistakenly thought this food would resemble authentic Mexican, it did not. Cheddar cheese does not belong in the kitchen of ANY Mexican restaurant.

The beef tacos were 80% lettuce, 10% cheddar cheese and 10% meat. Seriously, where's the beef??? They give you more meat on the chicken taco. I decided not to eat my remaining beef taco, instead I gave it to my husband who ditched the lettuce, cheese and shell and added the beef to his already skimpy taco. The food was along the same line as Taco Bell. I don't dislike Taco Bell, I just prefer real Mexican food.

The guac was not bad, it was also covered in cheddar cheese.",1
8235,"Oh. My. Dogstars. This place is perfect. The employees are so sweet I want to cry about it right now. Like, deliriously sweet. 
The ramen was just beyond. I guess I've never had ramen before this. Not like this. Heavenly. Prices are good. Portions are perfect, I had one bowl and think I might explode. I had the Kyouka ramen, medium spicy, my toddler son had the dipping ramen, and we shared the spicy chicken dish (I forget the name). Dipping ramen is just genius, I'll be getting that next time. My son loved the fish cakes and the meat pieces the best, silly boy. Though he put away his fair share of noodles as well - and slurped like a pro. He was a bit rambunctious and messy, but these wonderful employees were so graceful about it. I gave them a 20% tip because they deserved it. 
Lastly, the green tea was perfect, not too bitter, light and tasty. I can't wait to go back when we're not driving so I can try the plum wine. 
Thank you, Arigato, Kyouka! Delightful! 

(Love the little info cards at every setting, very interesting to read. Seriously about to shed a tear over how much I love this place. )",5
8236,"Wow! Went their on a whim and was pleasantly surprised to enjoy some of the best Thai food I've had in years. The atmosphere was relaxing, the staff polite and attentive. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",5
8238,"Thankfully, I do not live near this place or else I'd be 700lbs. This is hands down the best biscuit I've ever had in my life. I live a couple of hours away, but I may have to relocate. This place is just amazing. 

The food is so good the employees could throw it at me, but they were actually extremely helpful and nice.

Everything is fresh and the biscuits are actually made right there. They've been featured on the Food Network. They have other locations in other states. I am very happy they came to Concord.",5
8241,"It's been a long time since I've eaten at Neo Tokyo. It's got a different owner now and a different cook, I think.

My old favorite was Kung Pao Chicken, so I ordered it. Surprise! The Kung Pao Chicken didn't taste like what it used to - it taste like Orange Chicken! It's sweet, barely spicy. So, I asked if somehow they got the order mixed up. Staff said ""different restaurants taste different"" and offered to fix it. Well, it didn't get fix. It still tasted sweet with the same sauce and all that was done was to add more spice to it. Well, I was just too hungry to complain any further. Besides, I sometimes do eat Orange Chicken, so I let it pass.

I've been to a lot Chinese restaurants and it's only in Neo Tokyo that I have encountered sweet, barely spicy Kung Pao... too Americanized for my taste.

Not going to eat there anymore.",1
8242,"I love QT! The location is one of the busiest and that's understandable seeing that its located right off of the 51 freeway. This particular location already has the QT kitchen inside. I haven't tasted the food there yet, but it looks delicious and seems to be priced affordably. 

The staff has perfected being able to get you out in a speedy manner while providing top notch customer service.",5
8246,"They have free valet parking . The house is beautiful and cozy. The wait staff were very nice and professional. Got history of the house , which was cool. The food exceptional. Was given a cantaloupe gazpacho to starts things off. Yummy! I had crab cakes and a beet salad for starters. Wonderful! Then green apple sorbet before the main course, beautifully presented with a punk sugar rim. Had the grouper as a main course with polenta. Amazing !!! The dessert was chocolate and out of this world ! Best restaurant I have eaten at in Charlotte.",5
8247,Called the other day just to ask a few questions and next thing I know I'm sitting down talking with Randy the owner as he's designing from scratch my order. For someone who is a complete computer idiot this was amazing. Randy far exceeded my expectations on the design and made it far better than what I envisioned. Highly recommend them in the future and I will be back soon for some shirts hopefully!,5
8249,"Love this place--highly recommend it for several reasons: ambiance, food, and location. Oh yes...and service. They have the best Strawberry Lemonade in town and their Red Velvet Cake is divine. For appetizers you've got to try their BBQ Wings and our favorite dish is the Pulled Pork Sandwhich. The service is wonderful here because they don't just assign one waiter to you, anyone in a black Lucille's work tshirt will help you. We love their basket of sweet biscuits and butter they give each table before chow time. Being centered at the Tempe Marketplace, near shopping and Harkins Theatre, makes it a family favorite.",5
8250,"This is the BEST car service shop I have ever been to. The customer service is above and beyond! The employees are extremely friendly and helpful! I don't think I will ever go to another car shop again. They picked me up from my home, brought my car in and did several tests to figure out what was wrong. 

In addition to the amazing staff, the facility is really nice and inviting. The waiting room is quaint and relaxing with a TV, magazines and coffee.

This is truly the best in the business and I will recommend them to everyone I know! 

Thanks everyone at Car Repair Company for helping me out today :)",5
8251,"I absolutely love it when food tastes as good as it looks and Craftkitchen nailed it! I'm still dreaming about that short rib hash but the other dishes were really great too. The staff that I met there were all really wonderful and seemed like really great people that have such a love and passion for food. 

Beautiful delicious food and amazing people behind the food are just the perfect combination for me and really speak to my heart. 

Kudos, Craftkitchen! I really can't wait to come back!",5
8253,"Barrio is probably one of our favorite places in all of Cleveland.
First of all I love Day of the Dead decor and they go all out. Black and white murals in the main dining hall of skeletons and in the bar large paintings of skulls and some skeletons on bikes suspended from the ceiling.
We usually go during the week (the weekends are madness) and have no problems getting a seat at the bar with quick service. We usually get our free chips and salsa and drinks within 5 minutes and our orders out in less than an additional 5 minutes after ordering. Plus they serve food until 2am!
The food is fun (even have make your own)  and damn delicious. The margaritas are fabulously freaking yummy! Seems like they're all made from juice and fresh ingredients. The blood orange margarita has failed no one I've ever had try it. Tart & tangy!
Plus they have happy hour specials on tacos and margaritas 3pm-7pm and 9pm-2am M-F at the bar!",5
8254,"Came for winterlicioua lunch. The restaurant looked a bit crowded, but service was very good. I tried the salmon, and loved it! (Even more than the winterlicious lunch entr√©e from Canoe) Appetizer beef tartar was beautiful. Definitely recommend for winterlicious!",5
8256,"After our last visit to Pei Wei we won't back. The food is just way too sweet and there's nothing on the menu that isn't a sugar bomb. Panda Express, which I'm not a fan of, is so much better. 

Please do yourself a favor and stay away from this fake Asian food designed to taste like a candy bar. What are they thinking putting chicken, coated in a sugary sauce on a salad. ICK!

Here's what we got. An appetizer, two entrees and two drinks for almost $30. Way overpriced and tastes awful. 

Never, ever again.",1
8257,"I visited TruVape for the first time, These gentleman are top notch Russelle, Angelo and John extremely knowable and hospitable guys. Great Customer service. TruVape is truly the best vape Shop in Las Vegas. I won't go anywhere else after today !! 
Everyone that Vapes should come here l. Valley view and Spring mountain",5
8260,"If you have a large appetite, the AYCE option is definitely worth it, as long as you plan well and not wasting food. This is the most generous AYCE sushi place that I've ever experienced. You can order anything on the menu, including all the specialty sushi, appetizers, and dessert. We arrived at the restaurant right at the time of the opening for brunch. It is so popular that the dining room just got filled up quickly, and a long line was formed. The service was very fast and friendly. We first ordered 4 specialty full sushi, 2 specialty single order sushi and the soft shelled crab. We should have ordered half order since the full order sushi filled us up pretty quickly. There are almost 10 pieces per order. We then ordered sweet shrimp (very interesting half tempura shrimp head and raw seasoned tail), seafood salad (which is full of various fish and vegetables) and another uni sushi (my wife liked it). They are all flavorful and tasty! By this time, we filled up our stomach, and saved some room for mochi mango dessert - very delicious and not too sweet. Altogether the meal would have been almost $80's, but we paid about half of it (excluding tips). I'll make sure to revisit on my next trip to Vegas!",5
8261,"Family member recommended this restaurant... can't say anything bad it... staff was friendly... I ordered cheese enchiladas with red sauce and frozen mango margarita... Food potion is huge!! Margarita was a good size.. Food was hot and fresh.. restaurant is small, but I like to support small business!",5
8262,We went here for breakfast this morning with friends and the food wss excellent.   The staff and owner Troyce were very friendly.   This is a must go to place.  Mostly booths with a few tables so if you have a large group call ahead to get a table.  Pleade go and enjoy.,5
8264,"Not sure if you can give 0 stars so I will give one for the food which was good, but the rest of my experience was horrible.  Literally the worst service I have ever had.  Our server came to our table once to take the order then we never saw him.  The manager Frank brought the bill and told me he had to run my card 5 times because it kept declining but, he was able to finally get it to charge.  He said this in front of my entire party which I felt was rude and unnecessary and obviously an issue with his machine not the card.  Anyways horrible service rude managers epic fail.  Thanks CPK we won't be returning.",1
8267,"Wow what a nice bakery shop on the NE side of the river.  It's a pretty kickin' corner bakery with lots of light, chrome stools adjacent to a nice thick of wood where you can sit in the sun and enjoy their baked goods or their delicious pizza.

I couldn't take photos of their baked items as I needed the permission of the owner who wasn't there and I wish I had because this review doesn't do this bakery justice without the visuals.  But I will try my best.  

They had pumpkin spice cake neatly tied in a bundle at 4.95, pear and walnut tortes, rocky road layer cakes, and chocolate bombs. They have carrot cake, chocolate brownies, date squares and lemon squares all for $2.14.  They have a big banana mess at 3.95, assorted pies, sandwiches, salsas, granola, trail mixes, homemade jams and I have to breathe!

There is just such a nice mix here and the most upper end presentation, the goods are baked in the back and the staff is super friendly.  After reviewing many bakeries in Calgary I can say this is one of the top three and the prices are so affordable.  This urban baker sets high standards but keeps her goods accessible for the community.  I love that.",5
8268,"Cool bar and Night Club with the best view in town. Great music, good drinks and fantastic food mixed with stylish people. Get here before 10pm and you get a table with an awesome view over the strip. Definitely worth making the way to the south end of the strip!",5
8269,This was the worst chipotle we have had in a long time. The rice was clumpy and you couldnt taste the cilantro. The chicken looked ans tasted bad. The chips were brown/ burnt just and overall bad experience and regretting our choice to eat their today.,1
8276,"I've seen many chiropractors all across the west coast. Dr. Infantino is hands down the best care I have received. I Highly recommend Platinum Wellness. He is just an honest doctor that truly wants to help people. I even called in on some symptoms and asked if he thought an adjustment would help. Instead of capitalizing on the opportunity to push an appointment and collect, he advised the opposite and gave me advice for things to do at home. FOR FREE.",5
8278,I went there for first time not to long ago and it was so good. I got the shrimp Kabos and their to die for,5
8279,"My husband and I walked in right as the doors opened and were greeted immediately. Everyone was very welcoming and we loved the decor. Our server Tony offered us the daily specials, answered all our questions and even made suggestions. He was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. We had the pretzels with cheese for appetizers. They were the best we've ever had! Our sandwiches were tasty and proportions just the right size. Loved everything! Everyone should give this place a try when downtown. They'll be thrilled with the atmosphere, people and most importantly the awesome food!!!",5
8283,"I was almost scared off by all the negative experiences reported by others but, since the price was half what Alamo or Enterprise quoted and I've used Advantage in other locations with no problems, I decided to risk it. Maybe I just arrived at a good time (a Tuesday evening in May), but there was no line at the checkout and 3 or 4 clerks on duty so I only waited a couple of minutes. The clerk was very friendly and did not pressure me at all to take their insurance, extras, or pre-pay for gas so I was on my way to the car in about 10 minutes. No wait at the pickup desk either, the only hitch being that the car had a lot of cosmetic damage on the body so I had to fill out the form they gave me and turn it in before leaving (they made a copy and let me keep the original). Despite it's scruffy appearance the car was pretty nice for a ""Manager's Choice Special"" being a Kia Soul with a backup camera, climate and cruise control, plus the gas tank was full and interior was clean. When I returned the car check-in was very quick and the attendant confirmed that I would not be charged anything extra and emailed me a receipt on the spot. 

Bottom line: it is possible to have a good rental experience with Advantage, maybe just avoid busy times and have reasonable expectations for a discount rental company?",5
8285,This place is our go to before we hit the road from Vegas to LA - you're not gonna find a hearty breakfast like that in the bougie hotels ;),5
8287,"My go-to sushi place since moving to this side of town!

They have a late night happy hour menu with an awesome selection, extremely fresh nigiri, the greatest ponzu sauce I've ever had thus far, tasty sake collection, friendly staff, fantastic service - what more can you ask for?",5
8289,"So so yummy. The chipotle, blaze, and subway of high quality, super flavorful Mediterranean food.  A little spendy, but huge portion, expensive ingredients if I were to make at home.  Love it.  Will go back many times",5
8291,Awesome family run place with great food and service.  I was visiting from (way) out of town and found this restaurant from fellow Yelpers' recommendations.  I went for dinner and had an excellent experience.  The food was freshly made by Peter and was delicious.  There's quite a varied menu with something for everyone.  You can't go wrong here.,5
8292,Had them tint my car well over a week ago and everything is still looking good as new. Very happy with the results and customer service,5
8294,"Writing this in the car because I'm so mad. What a joke! Came here and ordered a mushroom, cheese and ham omelette. First one they brought had all the cheese at one end of the omelette with about 80% of the omelette having no cheese. She agreed and took it back to be remade, next one came out with huge chunks of unmelted cheese everywhere!! Told her thanks but I'm just going to take off as it had been about 40 minutes of my time wasted. She then proceeds to bring me a check for my iced tea!! Unreal!! I asked for the manager and she said ""you're good don't worry about it"".",1
8295,"We called Vegas Plumbing Service to come look at our leaking water heater.  We were so happy that they were able to get to our home within a couple of hours.  Our technician, Mike, did an excellent job installing a new water heater efficiently and effectively. He was punctual, professional, and personable.  Thank you for the excellent service.",5
8296,"Loved this place! Our waitress was Brittini she was so awesome. We were in a rush because, our movie started soon. She got us in & out. The cook gave my 4 year old a garlic knot & he loved it. Thanks guys for the ol school customer service!",5
8298,"Best ramen joint in town! Love the atmosphere and the staff is so friendly and attentive.  Place is small but cozy and I loved the music - a lot of old school hip hop and mixes. Had the tonkatsu which was clean and flavorful. Other ramen restaurants Tonkatsu are so heavy, but not this one.  Gyoza tastes fresh, not frozen like other places.  Mushroom spring rolls were very interesting, never had it in a ramen joint but it was very tasty, not at all greasy and the sauce was yummy. I didn't have any libations but can't wait to try some very soon. I wish I caught the DJ, but will definitely come back for more. I left a very happy girl.",5
8299,"Wow this place was remarkable!! My boyfriend and I didn't even make it off the elevator before I had to write a review. We shared The lobster Mac and cheese and filet, everything was absolutely delicious and the service was great. We are actually staying in the Hyatt Place downtown so this is very convenient and delicious and I'm so glad we went! We will be back and I will be recommending this place to all my friends!",5
8300,"In my opinion, this is the perfect coffee shop. It's tiny and cozy with just enough room to find a seat. The coffee and espresso drinks are very well made. There's a welcoming crowd of regulars but also enough space to remain anonymous if you need ""me time."" I really love this kind of non-overbearing friendliness.  They offer a prepaid-tab system. Best of all, while the place is small it STILL has  bathrooms (not one, but TWO).",5
8302,"As an RVer, I love this store.  I've bought numerous rugs for our RV that have been the incorrect size for the space I wanted to cover, because that was all I could find.  I then found Mesa Sales & Supply, bought a carpet remnant, and had rugs bound to the exact size I wanted.  I even bought new foam for our dog crate, which they cut to the appropriate size.  Once finding a sales person who could help me, service was great, and the rugs were the size I specified.  Great job!",5
8304,"Nothing to write home about. Ignorant staff, manager doesn't care and it showed in the service. Overpriced. Will not return.",1
8305,"Suddenly the familiar guitar intro from ""The Bitch Is Back""  churns the air.  The lights come up and Sir Elton John struts out on stage.  He mouths a thank you and quickly sits down to finish out the song.  There's a brief pause to say hello and thank you for coming and then he hits the first chord of ""Bennie and the Jets"".  Everybody in the house is on their feet and cheering.  Another Elton John concert has begun and it's a damn good one too.

Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Philadelphia Freedom, Your Song, Rocket Man, Levon, I'm Still Standing...they were all there.  Elton John also includes Empty Garden - one of his best ever, his tribute to John Lennon.  Elton John gives you your money's worth with a full two hours of music, banter and insights into his songwriting with Bernie Taupin.  

The stage is impressive too in a typically Elton John over the top way.  Add in some excellent background videos to keep things interesting.  There's something going on at all times.  His band is also in top form.  They've been playing with Elton John for decades and they all come together seamlessly.  Ray Cooper on percussion is particularly entertaining.

There's so much I could say and I could go on and on.  Whether you love him or hate him, Sir Elton John is an icon.  He's one of the greatest showmen on earth and he's still at the top of his game.

Simply said:  The man puts on a damn good show and I had a great time.",5
8308,"Hello Bistro has been on my short list of places to try when traveling to Pittsburgh, for business.   I ventured there at around noon on a Thursday afternoon,  The place was packed.  Most tables where occupied and there was a line for food, but the line moved very quickly.  I approached the register, ordered the salad bar $7.95, add chicken for an additional $2 and quickly took my place in line to have an employee prepare my salad, to my liking.  I love the idea of a salad bar, where the employees prepare the food.  No germy customers touching the items.   The options are endless!   Lots of healthy options, starting with your choice of greens.  I chose the kale/spinach mix, but there was also spring greens and romaine to choose from.  I topped my salad with quinoa (yum!!), chickpeas and lots of other fresh veggies.  There were raw options and roasted options in addition there were 3 options for chicken, Tandoor, Fajita, or salt/pepper/garlic.  I opted for the latter.  My selection was then passed on to the next station where it was chopped, topped (I chose pepitas) and dressed.  I really enjoyed my salad, the portion and value was spot on.  I'll definitely go back!",5
8309,"For those of you still shooting film, this is the best place in town to get it developed. They are friendly, knowledgeable, and professional.  I won't trust anyone else with my film.  They have great prices too.",5
8311,"I use to have Yareli as my therapist but she moved on but I had Janiele yesterday and she is  an outstanding therapist. During the session I received a bad cramp and she massaged it until it went away, to me that is awesome and shows that she cares about her clients! She went out of the way to make the service great!  She is very professional and very knowledgeable therapist!  Book with her and you will not be dissatisfied I promise!",5
8312,Love the grilled pork banh mi. Best on the east coast.,5
8316,"Will probably come back whenever I'm in Vegas! When my best friend and I went, the line wasn't too bad for a Sunday morning. Waited for 15 min. 

It was totally worth it. We shared the Hawaiian French toast works (which is like the waffle works but with French toast, secret menu). The portions here are huge so I'm happy we shared. It was yummy and I really like the compote that it came with. 

Don't forget to check in for the free banana nut muffin! We were so stuffed that we took those bad boys to go!",5
8318,"I have been using this company for a while. I am very pleased with the new management. They are always professional and nice and I absolutely love my hair system. I've known Sean for a while and just recently met Tami, who is very pleasant. The staff explains everything and never makes you feel bad or self conscience. They are always ready to help with any questions or issues I have, Sean always goes above and beyond.  The stylists definitely know what they are doing. Just a quick thank you!",5
8319,"I am so glad that my lease is up here I could not get out of there fast enough.  When I moved in to my apartment it was filthy with dust and dirt and hair from the previous renters! Yes hair! The cleanliness in the overall building is horrible! There is little to no noise control. The maintenance people are incompetent, rude, and will not come unless you call for them at least 5 times and then will give you attitude about calling so much. The leasing staff have no idea what their talking about. And in the end screwed my roommate and I over leaving us with no choice but to pack up everything and move out in one day or pay an additional $1,000 for 15 days. I would not recommend this place to anyone.",1
8321,"I love coffee and I love Starbucks. I go everyday. Many times to multiple locations. This location has nothing wrong with it if you like to have the most annoying flamboyant young man working there. He sings in an annoying voice at the top of his lungs. Thrusts his flamboyant personality upon everyone in the coffee shop and is a constant distraction with his antics. As I sit here trying to compose this email he is making it difficult to even think because he is singing Disney soundtracks! A couple of other customers have commented on how distracting it is because his annoying and shrill voice breaks into every conversation that's being had. It makes this Starbucks dreadful when he is working. I understand having fun at work and having a personality but he is infringing on people that come here to have conversations, conduct business, and even study. He is a nuisance. I wish him terminated.",1
8322,Great times!!! Bought tickets online got there 15/20 mins before and didn't have a problem! Saw Keith Nelson - funniest shit ever!!! Guy was hysterical! I couldn't breath!! If u ever have a chance to see him DO IT!!!! We will be back :),5
8323,"5-stars all the way! @PetlandCA .. As soon as I walked in I was acknowledged by a staff member.  Nothing huge, just a nod to indicate a ""hello, I know you're here"".  I like that.

I walked around looking for a new aquarium to replace my small cracked one.  I was interested in the new modern looking design of the Fluval Edge.  I was concerned about the design and how to clean them.  The staff member saw I had a question, asked if I needed help and proceeded to tell me everything he knew about the unit.  I was impressed and I was on the fence about getting it but because of his help I was convinced it was the right decision.

They were about $30 more expensive than the local competitor so I asked if they would be willing to match the price.  The staff member took the time to check their website and when the price wasn't listed online he took the liberty to call the store directly.  That's great customer service because it showed he was willing to go out of his way to help.  I usually don't ask for price matches but I thought a $30 difference was quite substantial.

If you ever need any advice on fish or aquariums go to the Sunridge Petland and talk to Tim.  He'll be able to help you out.

P.S.  I have to note that this Petland is very well laid out and is one of the only pet stores that I don't have air quality issues with.  I have asthma and am allergic to a lot of animals.  When I walk into most pet stores I have difficulty breathing.  Not at this store.  Good job Sunridge Petland!",5
8324,"Still great.  Carnitas tacos are probably the best in town (only been to Maize once, though).  My husband and I had a horrible realization one night when we got Taco Bell and only afterwards realized it was $1 taco night at Huaraches.  Noooooooo, worst decision ever!  In summary, Taco Bell is awful and not even that cheap anymore.  Go to Huaraches instead.",5
8325,Big time favorite for my wife and me.   Good service and the food is great.   Try the pizzas.,5
8327,"Was here about a week ago and had the smoked pot roast.  Great dinner. Excellent attentive service.  Seems to be a popular locals place.

Update: 2nd visit tried the ribeye steak with side salad and loaded baked potato. Steak was typical ""institutional""steak, cooked well though with a nice garlic butter on top. Nothing wrong with it, but, nothing special either.  Don't think it was worth 24.99.  Potato had decent quantity of toppings.  I'll be back, but, sticking to smoked and bbq.",5

8329,"TOTAL TOURIST TRAP!!! 

NYE 2010 Dinner  (Wasted over $400 here on NYE 2010 prix fixe menu. )

Worst NY Strip and Filet Mignon ever!!! NO Taste and Rubbery

NY Steak ordered Medium Rare and  served medium well :-(. Filet ordered Medium and servedMedium Rare :-(. 

Terrible excuse for Pom Frittes.  

Salad had one barely recognizable bite of goat cheese, but was good as was the oysters appetizer. 

The Creme Br√ªl√©e was OK and the coffee excellent. 



""Cocktail Hour"" 

was missing cocktails and only served sparkling wine. FAIL!!! $120 for cheap sparkling wine and OK appetizers. At least the view of the strip was nice and wait staff was attentive.

The dinner was awful. We were sandwiched between two other tables elbows almost brushing our neighbors, hardly romantic or nice for $110 per person NYE dinner. There were many empty tables and sections available yet we were sandwiched between other tables like sardines. 

Although the servers were nice they never asked us if our meal was ok and they couldn't infer by the barely eaten plates that something was awry. The NY Strip was served 2 temperatures overcooked. My girlfriend's salad was taken away before she was finished because there was no room on the table for an extra plate and they brought our Main Course out to us before we finished our salads. Absolutely awful experience. You should have seen the sight of everyone who ordered the steaks sawing away at the rubbery excuse for steak. I kept wondering if it was MUTTON!!!!",1

8335,"Arrived promptly to provide a bid. Came in with the best bid. Completed the job on time and on a budget and to spec. Good workmanship. If I had more gutters to do, I would turn to Jason and Kenny at Arizona VGS. And, who wouldn't prefer to hire veterans to do the job. Highly recommended.",5
8337,"Love this place. I am a new customer (going the last few months), as I have read some of the other reviews they may have been having some issues with quality or their cook a year or so ago, but whatever they are doing now keeps me coming back. 

I love the decor, and staff are always attentive and respectful, and the place is always busy (good sign). Drinks are always refilled in a timely manner, the margaritas are always cold and delicious. 

The Jalapeno bean dip and the enchilada style chicken burrito will always have a special place in my stomach from this place. I must reiterate, the chicken here is AMAZING, any dish you get with chicken on it you will love, whatever they are doing, just keep doing it and I'll keep coming back.",5
8338,"Very experimental beers. Jalape√±o heffe, watermelon heffe, coffee kolsch... Really enjoyed them all. Place is very nice, staff very courteous. They had an outside vendor providing food which was also great.",5
8339,"This place used to be my go to place (especially at 4 am in the morning) whenever I was hungry and was looking for some cheap tasty authentic food. But since Mr. Boustan ""The Legend"" himself has retired, it's just another ""Amir"" and it's not worth it anymore. Sad sad story :( Boustan was filled with life an energy now the staff is rude and entitled.

Their garlic potatoes are still interesting enough for tourists to adventure there but... Waste of taste in my opinion.",1
8343,"I was here during the Las Vegas Marathon with my girlfriend and some friends.  This was, hands down, the best steak house experience I've ever had.

The atmosphere of this restaurant is completely different than what I'm used to.  It caters towards a younger and trendier crowd (it is Las Vegas after all), which is something not often seen in Chicago.  With that being said, the quality of the food did not suffer one bit.

I forget what everyone else had that day, but I ordered the 18 oz bone-in ribeye, cooked to perfection at medium rare.

And surprisingly, the part of the meal that stood out the most was the truffled mac and cheese.

I know what your thinking, how good could mac and cheese possibly be?  That's what I was thinking too.  I was actually leaning towards something more expensive as my side dish, but the waiter kept insisting I get the (cheaper) mac and cheese.  Wise choice.

Kudos all around to the chefs and the outstanding service.  I will definitely make this a regular stop every time I come to Las Vegas.",5
8344,"I loved it. You order at the counter and get your food in minutes. The 1 problem was the stranger in front of me had her order on my ticket. No biggee..they fixed it. Food is such a good price too, and you get to try their salsas free..awesome place.",5

We ordered 6 dozen assorted cupcakes for our Las Vegas wedding.  I couldn't make up my mind on what I wanted so I said...you pick. 
They were the best damn cupcakes I have ever had in my entire life.   
We even picked up a couple for breakfast...maple bacon and glazed donut.....best breakfast I have ever had!

Kari was actually working the counter when we walked in.  She made us feel welcome...like we were regular customers.  She even gave me some words of encouragement about opening my own bakery some day (on the other side of the country.....there is no way I could compete with Retro).

I can't wait to go back!  We are already planning a trip in December!",5

8353,"Terrible lying cheating sales department. Was buying a car from out of state and going to fly in and pick the car up and drive home. Deal had been agreed upon, purchase agreements and wiring instructions were being faxed back and forth between the dealership and my bank and paper work was being signed over the coarse of the day. The salesman told me the car was being put under cover until i picked the car up and would not be showed. I was online about to purchase airline tickets and I get an email saying sorry to let you know that the car has been sold...... 5 minutes later and I would of been out airline tickets. I might expect that from some shady used car lot but not from a BMW dealership.",1
8354,"I recently stayed at this location. My member number needed to be updated since it was an older number. They updated my number at this hotel, but for some reason could not change the rate. Then, my email was put in incorrectly for fmail instead of gmail. I was told it was fixed after I went back, but it was still incorrect when I tried to sign in and had to call the 800 number later. I also told the hotel about the shower in my room that had not been cleaned. That morning I was going to go take a shower until I realized there was a used bar of soap with pubic hair on it and the drain had black stuff around it. I was just told they would let housekeeping know, but was not offered another room. They told me to call Hyatt at 800-228-3360 and they could adjust my rate to the member rate. For some reason, she couldn't change it, but said they could change that for me. The phones in the hotel and in the rooms didn't even work. I called the 800 number later just to hear that they couldn't do anything and I needed to call the hotel where I stayed. I told them I was told to call the 800 number. After I said that, she emailed the hotel and said she will have an upper executive contact me from this hotel. What I got was a email from just some guy in Guest Services out in Illinois who sent me the following apology for my inconvenience and that they will not do anything, but hope that I chose Hyatt again speech below.

""I do apologize for any inconvenience that you may have been caused during your stay with the issues with the rate you were charged. Unfortunately the Member Discount rate is based upon availability and is subject to change, and often times it does need to be booked in advance to ensure that discount is applied. As to the cleanliness of the bathroom I do greatly apologize that it was not up to Hyatt standards and I will be notifying the management team in housekeeping in the hopes that this is not a recurring incident. I again do apologize for any inconvenience you have been caused and I do hope that you continue to choose Hyatt as your 'home away from home while traveling.""

Still hoping to hear back from an executive at Hyatt and some better training is done on some of their employees on customer service and satisfaction. Paying almost $200 for a room like this with no member rate and a gross shower is not acceptable.

I'm so happy that the moved to the other corner of the block for the larger location. The food is worth the wait  it's just to bad everyone else has to agree.

8364,"This is definitely not the SportChek you ever want to go to...the people are not helpful with a ridiculous cocky attitude. Not in this day and age, where service is REQUIRED to be good. This place is the total opposite.

Let's start by: I saw these pair of Nike shoes on sale, went into the store trying to get my size, Nothing on the shelf. Tried to get an employee to help me out to see if my size was available in the back stock. Took over 15 mins to try and get some help, the guy forgot about me...after another 15 mins. I asked politely if they could check another store. Another 10 mins later, he came back and said the other stores are too busy and need to put him on hold for 20 mins? Seriously?

Anyways, my foot sometimes ranges from a 7-7.5. Only size 7 was available, So I took a risk and asked if I bought it, would it be possible if I try it out and walk around it more at home, if it was not comfy enough, I could return it. I got a Yes within 60 days! So I did!

bought it home, tried walking around the house with it for awhile and it wasn't as comfy as hoped for. Went back to the store the THIRD day after I bought it, the person that did the return tried to ACCUSE me into wearing the shoes for a long time. I said, It's the THIRD day, how can there be enough wear and tear on the THIRD day. 

Gave me a ridiculous attitude and made it sound like he was doing me a favor for returning the shoes. Horrific service. I will NEVER go back. SportCheck wanting to earn my business back is gonna seriously need some better employees with sincerity.

Appreciate your job and your customers.",1
8370,"This store is old and dirty. The employees are always smoking out front. The produce section isn't bad but the deli has dirty case windows and the meat cutters are left filthy.

8381,It's no surprise this place is rated as high as it is. Another cool spot in PHX. Had the b.m.o.c. and it was pretty incredible. The combination of a fried egg over a smoked pork chop on top of a waffle was f'ing amazing.,5
8384,"We love this place. Fair warning, it is cash only so bring some old fashioned paper money. I have only had one thing there that I'd say is ""average"" and that's the corn dog. I've tried about every dog on the menu (besides chili dogs because I couldn't do that to my family!) and I have really liked them all. The Kraut dog, Milwaukee Brat, and Polish dog are my favorites. It's obviously hard to mess up a hot dog but I think it's equally difficult to make them as good as they do. Good dogs, good buns, and the toppings are good as well (I get the works on everything except the kraut dog, keep that simple). Between my wife, my son, and myself we usually get 6 hot dogs, a corn dog, and a drink or two and walk out only $20 down. It's one of our favorites.",5

8388,"Like the accidental tourist (and many other people), we happened into this place after dropping a boat load of cash on two glasses of wine at Postino's. After getting the car from the Valet, we started to drive away from Postinos and spied Aiello's.  After a quick tour around the block, once again passing the valet, who shot us a confused look, we turned in to what has become one of our favorite haunts for a quick glass of wine and some fantastic New York Italian fare. 

The ambiance is subtle and not over the top, but who doesn't like a huge Christmas wreath over the bar all year round.  The wine selection here is minimal but good, with a house Chianti that was better when we first started going but has been replaced with one that is almost as good.  But, I prefer the Sangiovese, mostly because I like to hear Angela, one of the servers say Sangiovese in her Romainian accent...fairly sexy. So much, that  to my wife's chagrin I began calling her Sangiovese girl. I digress...Bread is an important part of the meal for me, especially when splurging.  The bread here is over the top good, dense and flavorful.  They import special peppers for the oil that they serve with the bread which is slightly spicy and a must when you eat here.  The peppers do make a difference, as when they ran out, and had to temporarily use other peppers, it was not as good.  

Every dish that we have tried has been fantastic, with favorites that revolve around the special ravioli of the day (the veal and the mushroom are best to me) Joes Famous Spaghetti and Meatballs and the tortelloni.  My wife is especially fond of the Fried Artichoke Hearts.  All in all, I have not had a bad meal here and have had many over the top meals leaving me fatter and happier, and ready for a nap.  The owners Joe and Myra go out of their way to make people feel at home with an atmosphere that is very family oriented.  Soon they will sell pizzas out the back door...good deal, I can't wait and if I can convince them, pizzas at the bar (easier said then done to convince them).  All in all, a good staple italian restaurant that makes my heart warm, and my tummy full.",5
8390,"Love love this place. My friends and i went here on trip to vegas and everything was great. I ordered enchiladas de mole, ohhh so good.

Not only were the gals that rent the apartments nice and the management but also the repair guys and landscapers. Every little issue that came up was fixed that day or the next. The grounds are green, pleasant and cared for. The pool was nice and clean. It has a TV for sports and we found it works great for Music too. I have now moved back into a house and would highly recommend Camden Legacy to friends and family. You too! Oh, one last thing.

8394,"I met Dr. Athari in 2011 because of a sensitive side tooth decay I had. Ever since then I have referred my mother and father and sister to him as well as some of my friends. I needed extensive fillings because of large decayed teeth. He fixed them all over a short period of several visits and I see him regularly to prevent any more headaches for myself. What I love about him is the fact that he takes so many pictures from whatever it is that he is doing in my mouth and shows them to me afterwards. He explains all of it in detail and a few years later another tooth had been bothering me so we both could go back in time and look at the tooth that he had worked on before we initiated a new fix. He even says it is hard to remember every case and writing detailed notes is not a comparison for actual pictures of each stage. each picture speaks a long story by it self. As a result of the dental education I received I have become a better more informed patient and have learned that caring for my teeth is a ""lifestyle"" as he says it. My treatment was easy compared to my mothers case which was far easier than my father's case. My mom had old crowns from decades ago that had failed and created a major cosmetic nightmare for her. She would always cover her smile and her pictures her hand was always covering her smile and laughter. She was so conscious about this that all of us knew this. She would not even hide the fact and she always mentioned how embarrassed her teeth and gaps and smile were. On top of that she was very anxious about the dentist and was deathly fearful because of her past experiences. An emergency swelling and situation brought her in. He had to work very hard reprogramming her fear and anxiety before she allowed him to even get close to numb her up. Long story short many visits and many years later finally my mother was comfortable enough to allow him to do a full mouth reconstruction for her and cosmetically fix her crowns and veneers. She goes out of her way in pictures with her smiles. She cried of happiness when the crowns were delivered and she could see herself in the mirror without the major gaps and the wide teeth. She too is very careful about her teeth now and not a day goes by that I don't see her beautiful smile. My father has also experienced major dentistry from Dr. Athari. He had to first remove all of his top teeth and most of the bottom teeth. Had dentures for a while. This year Dr. Athari placed 5 implants for him on top jaw. I was there and he had a videographer video the whole thing and take pictures as well. All I know was that he said it was a very hard case due to lack of bone. I saw parts of the surgery too. And it is beyond me how this happened but my dad had absolutely no swelling or pain. Took some days off from work but the next day called in and told them he wanted to come to work. the implants have been solid ever since and he is awaiting the next phase. all in all I am happy we met Dr. Athari. He calls after every appointment to see how we are doing. I think to write about any practice or doctor it is better to be able to show a time frame experience as opposed to write what it was like the first appointment, but thats just me. i recommend him for anyone who needs a real dentist and someone who will be by their side as he only does one patient at a time.",5

8396,"Disgusting... I'm completely appalled at how they let dogs feast on their plates and let them urinate in the patio. It was my 21st birthday and it was nice up until I was eating and suddenly lost my appetite after smelling this strong urine odor. The dogs had an accident and I told the waiter about it. He brought out the manager and she told us that the patio is pet friendly. If I knew they let pets defecate and urinate on their furniture I wouldn't sit outside... And if I knew they allow the pets to eat off the same plates they serve to customers I wouldn't order anything!!! The manager offered to move us, a party of 9, instead of telling the couple with the two dogs to move since we had the problem with the pets emptying their bowls. After she spoke to us she spoke to the couple with the pets and started to pet their dogs... 

That was just a slap on the face, how dare you have the audacity to tell me to move and then pet the dogs that just pissed under and around one of your tables. 
Bad management. Disgusting place. They try to be upscale but allow URINE. Even if it is outdoor seating it's still a restaurant. I've yet to come across another restaurant that allows the same thing to happen.",1

When it comes to fresh quality fish, this is my go to spot for the Glendale area!",5
8408,"My family and I paid a total of $1,770.36 to stay at the Linq Hotel this weekend-- two rooms, three nights. You may think to yourself, that's not a bad deal, why is she giving them one star?! Let me count the ways:

1. The entire hotel smells like an old casino, filled with smoke, which is typical of Vegas, but then someone tried to cover it up with mens cologne, leaving the entire hotel reeking of old man.

2. Want to request a clock radio to listen to some music, seeing as you're staying in Vegas and might want to have a little fun? No can do. Could not meet our request to bring up a clock radio.

3. When I booked this hotel, they told me that the pool is strictly 21+, which it is, but that we could take the kid to the Caesar's Palace or Paris pool. Awesome. When we arrived, the Linq told us that the Caesar's Palace pool was not open for the winter. Not awesome. Next day we have brunch at Caesar's Palace brunch, and whadya know, Caesar's Palace pool is OPEN. WTF. Then we go out to the pool to use it, and they tell us we can't be there, and Linq patrons, indeed, CAN'T use their pool. 

4. THEY ONLY GIVE YOU WI-FI ACCESS FOR TWO PEOPLE IN EACH ROOM. Wow. Like it costs them more to let more people on? Super disgustingly cheap. When we called down to ask if we would be able to perhaps get more people access, we were denied, of course. And the internet they DID provide? Terrible. Oh, and don't try making any calls or sending any texts from either the lobby or your room. There absolutely NO reception anywhere. 

5. Want privacy in your room while someone is using the bathroom? Forget it. They have one very large door that ROLLS and doesn't fully close OR LOCK.

6. Want to enjoy a nice TV show while you're resting? Forget that too. Reception was terrible the entire time. Tried to watch the Husky/USC game in our room, and our experience was ruined. 

The only redeeming quality about this hotel is its location. Take my advice and spend a little extra money and stay at Caesars Palace or the Venetian, if location is what you desire. My family gave The Linq $1,770.36 this weekend, and they gave us NOTHING. If anything, they made our experience worse. Would never recommend this hotel to anyone.",1

8415,". I'll admit it up front, Maggie Oakes was,not my first choice for dinner on a Saturday night in Montreal, so the fact that we found ourselves there was just a stroke of really, really good fortune.

The location on Place Jacques-Cartier is really great.  Don't be concerned with its proximity to Ben and Jerry's and Old Montr√©al's ubiquitous tee-shirt shops.  What was a great location in April has yo even better in the summer months.  

Inside is sleek and modern without pretense. Our service was fantastic; our waiter (Max?) helped us with the menu and made some great recommendations. A charcuterie appetizer and its cheeseboard friend both offered some Quebec offerings I may not be able to find at home, so it was a good start.  We had a 60 oz bone-in steak prepared for five (off the menu and worth asking if they can do it for you). The beef was amazing and the accompanying vegetables and potatoes could have stood on their own. The wine and beer lists are diverse and priced well.",5
8416,"Okay, I am going to rate this restaurant 5 stars but I will offer my fellow diners a word of caution. Please read to the end for my note of caution. Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed every meal I've had at this restaurant. We'll usually start with the olive sampler for the table. I usually order a drink with dinner (please see below). You know how some restaurants do great with starters and salads and fall on the entree? Not this place. When they thought up the word umami, they had this place in mind. You really have to try the short ribs on a bed of risotto. I've had it 3 times and I enjoy it more every time I go. This last time I had the veal osso buco and, what can I say? It was beefy and luscious and melt in your mouth. Umami! The service was attentive but not overbearing. None of us got the dessert so I can't comment. Now, for my word of caution. We were having a good time and I wasn't paying attention.  I ordered a Blanton's Manhattan up. It was tasty. It was about an average pour in terms of size. In terms of quality I would put it at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10. What is amazing is its price tag of $16. I don't think I was charged $16 in Manhattan for a Manhattan. Unfortunately, I ordered  2 and $32 later, I had racked up a bit of a bar tab. I can just hear what you're saying: ""Caveat emptor.""  And you're right. So, to be fair, the restaurant is slightly below average in interior design in terms of what you would expect for the quality of meal that they serve. This is not the interior of 11, for instance or Umi. To compare, you will pay about the same.  But the wait staff couldn't be better. The food couldn't be better. Just watch out for the price of the drinks! Perhaps consider stopping at one!",5
8418,"Ya know, this was my favorite place in Vegas until today. We are frequent customers but I won't be back to this location after the way I was treated today. My husband and I are celebrating our 15th anniversary and this is where I wanted to go for lunch. I ordered my usual, rocky road pancakes. When they came, they weren't right. They had chocolate chips on them instead of the normal marshmallows. I sent it back and was sure to be nice to the server...after all, it wasn't his fault. 25 mins later, I STILL hadn't gotten my pancakes. My husband had eaten his entire meal while I sat there and watched numerous tables get their orders. I've worked in restaurants, the common practice is to fix a customer's order before working on new orders. I complained to the manager and all she could say was ""there's a health inspector here and she's not letting us work."" Really? Because other people have gotten their food, no problem. Then she offered to take it off my bill. Gee, how generous of you...SINCE I NEVER EVEN GOT THE FOOD! I walked out extremely pissed and will not be back",1
8420,"We had a great wonderful time at Macaroni.  We ordered the tasting menu which was so much fun, flavorful and exciting.  Would highly recommend it.  Kristin the manager came over to make sure everything was awesome and it was!!",5
8422,"Just a really shitty deli. Old cold cuts, bread that's not fresh & slapped together. I'm no Jimmy Johns fan but when you see this places quality, you understand why they're doing so well in Charlotte",1
8423,I've been coming here for several months and I've had wonderful experiences every single time. My gel manicures have lasted three weeks or more. There's a really large selection of gel colors. Shout out to Lisa! She does an amazing job and always makes sure my nails are perfect (and sparkly).,5
8424,"I love living in Val Vista Lakes. The club house is so nice!  The pools are so nice, the beach is great.  The tennis courts are super nice too. It's like living at a resort.",5
8426,"Came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary and we both agreed it was the BEST MEAL OF OUR LIVES! No exaggeration. He had the ahi tuna while I had the short rib last week and we are still dreaming about it! Great wine selection, too. We splurged more than ever because it was our anniversary and the waiter clearly overheard us saying that, because they gave us the most beautiful and delicious dessert we've ever had, free of charge!!! We can't wait to come back-- thank you, STK! We'll name our first born after you. He will be ruthlessly made fun of for having ""STK"" for a name and it will be WORTH IT.",5
8427,"I have to say among the Hawaiian places I've tried all over the valley... This bar far is the most and most authentic! Portion sizes are huge and more than enough to eat there be full and take plenty home. I've had the Korean garlic chicken, the hamburger loco moco, Katsu chicken loco moco, kalbi spare ribs and the spamasubi. I have never been disappointed food wise. 

The place on the outside looks nothing short of standard and not anything special or impressive at all. It's rather spacious inside and average amount of seating for a family owned establishment. It's always a good sign when you see islanders eating coz you know the food is legit. Always people in here eating and always at least someone from Hawaii inside enjoying the grub there. 

The most recent time I went tho, I have to say the service was on the poor side. Granted, it was really busy that day, but we waited for our check and refill on drink from at least ten minutes. A server or cook from the back came out to help seat people and saw someone she knew eating and got caught up talking to that table for a while. We kept trying to get her attention until finally the customer that was talking to this server told US that WE should just go up to the counter to get someone's attention... Excuse me?! Poor form. That person should told the employee ""hey we'll talk later you have customers"" and directed her to us.! So naw we sat there and waited. And poor form on that server for having a ten minute conversation with a table when the placed is packed and we can't get anyone to notice that we want the check and to go boxes to dip outta there. 

Normally neglect of service is something I hold highly to food and dining establishments and take off a whole star for that. But dam this place is so bomb with the food... I'll let that one time slide. The customer service can make or break a dining experience for a person. And if the service is exceptional or good like it's supposed to be... It can sometimes make the meal all the more enjoyable. Tighten up on that customer service... Then it's top notch best Hawaiian food in town.",5
8430,This is the best Los Favs in Arizona if not the entire world. Now im going to keep typing because Yelp won't let me post without doing so. But really you can stop reading because there is no real subtance left in this review because I used all my brainpower to formulate the first sentence which is a very good one if I may say so myself.,5
8432,Excellent food and wonderful service. The staff is so welcoming and willing to help. If it's you first time dining here they a eager to assist and walk you through the process. A great place to take the family.,5
8435,"Love, love, love this Starbucks-alternative. Yes they have free internet if you make a purchase. Yes they offer complimentary fresh-fruit flavored water. Yes they have an extremely wide variety of French & Chinese style pastries, sausage en croute, veggie curry en croute, fresh fruit topped light cheesecake. 

Everything is labeled with the calories and all of the ingredients. Overall it's much less sweet than traditional American style pastries. There are some pre-made salads options. Their specialty appears to be elaborate fruit topped cakes for a party. 

I've found service to be excellent, although sometimes they get too busy to greet everyone. Not a problem as they're so helpful when I get to the counter. Also there's always plenty of comfy seating, and quiet French or American music playing.",5
8436,"We are from Erie, PA, and were in search of a Kia Sorrento..nowhere in our local area had what we were looking for. We drove to Montrose ford and their employees did not seem eager to help us, nor work for a deal that we could afford.  We were convinced that we would be leaving Ohio without a new vehicle our family desperately needed. At one last ditch effort, we stopped at Bill Doraty's, and it was the best car buying experience ever! I came in the door very discouraged and sad, Adam a sales manager approached us, and his first reaction was to my sadness..he was convinced in making me smile, and helping us out.  Not once did Adam or Steve make us feel bad about our low credit score, in fact, they gave us helpful pointers..they were caring, kind and compassionate.  I will travel the 2 hours again when I purchase a new vehicle...I am a lifetime fan of Bill Doraty Kia. From the bottom of our hearts, we thank you",5
8438,"My husband and I have been staying here of the past 3 years on our anniversary. We love booking our stay here because of the friendly employees and the location is great. The Adventuredome is automatically 5 stars for us. Not including the Grill, the room and the overall experience. 

Room: Was spacious, quiet, clean and safe. 

Internet: Why do you need internet when you're in VEGAS?? Go out and have some fun! You can be on the internet when you are at home! ;)

Food/Restaurants/Buffets: We loved everything we ate there EXCEPT the Pizzeria. Everything else was great. 

Employees/CheckIn/Out: We had no real big issues. The first time we checked in, we did not know check in was at 3PM, so our room was not ready. We were there at around 11AM and we ended up taking a room that had two Queen/Full beds rather than the King. But we were hardly in the room. We were out roaming around Vegas so it didn't make a difference much. 

Casino: I mean what can you say-its a casino! Slots, tables, people everywhere gambling having fun! As long as I can play my favorite game ""GoldFish"" then we have no problems! ;)

We will be there again this year for our anniversary! Can't wait!",5
8439,"Working with Sky van lines has completely lowered my stress level since I have had a long distance move to NY. They did a job in a very smooth way which made me feel relaxed during the entire moving process. The guys who moved my things were Michael and his two helpers and they were really taking care of every single item and piece of furniture. These people came a bit before the time arranged and they started packing and loading my stuff straight away. This is what Tal, the sales person at Sky van lines promised me and I found him to be very friendly and kind. He gave me the precise quote and when the move was done I paid the amount I was told at the very beginning, there were no hidden costs or fees. All in all, I am very happy with the job they did and I would absolutely recommend them to everyone. Thank you guys! It was a pleasure working with you!",5
8440,"I've been eating here for years! My daughter loves the food here too.
Decided to try the taco Tuesday special $1.75 for chicken , beef or pork. The pork is a sweet pork (yummy)
Today I asked for corn tortillas. OMG! They made them fresh for me! Superb! Perfectly cooked and not crumbly!!

YOU GOTTA TRY THE CORN TORTILLAS!!!

We also had the Flan and Key Lime pie. JUST DO IT!!!",5
8443,"I have been here a few times and I love it.
The Guinness is lovely- like back home in Ireland.
The food was great too. Plentiful and tasty.
Nice atmosphere and friendly staff.
Will go back ;)",5
8444,"By far the best chicken i've had in Montreal. The place is simple but they serve good food, fast. Their menu is small but portion are generous. We tried the legs trio and the Caesar salad with grilled chicken. Both were great and even my two young children loved it. The owner was also very nice. We will definitely be returning here.",5
8445,We walked in to a beautiful display of treats in different shapes and sizes for the pups. That's what made us stay and look around. While we were here we were able to see the dogs in the back who get grooming services and even got to play with the sho owners pup! We found a joint leash for our dogs and some breath freshener and she included some free treats for the pups! I love this store and although they are a bit expensive we will be coming back for more!,5
8450,Dr. Bowen and his staff are a few of the kindest and most patient medical practitioners I have met.  Both of my kids saw Dr. Bowen for their braces and he was warm and interested in my children.  My daughter's teeth were especially tricky and she now has a beautiful smile and the self confidence that goes with it.,5
8451,Well I wish I had a good experience. I had a bee hive in one of my trees. I looked on yelp to find someone and I saw you had good ratings. Your ad stated you were open until 10:00pm so I called at 6:30pm well before your closed time and left a message. And you returned the call this morning giving an excuse that it was later in the day and that why we missed your call...so this why I'm writing a review. Your ad is misleading. If you say 10:00pm  than answer the phones til at least 9:50pm....you have a nice day and evening,1
8453,One of the best arabic cuisine i have had in a long time. The good was delicious and the owner are superb in their welcome,5
8455,"Giving 1 star because I can't give 0 stars!

I called to ask for a part for a Cuisinart machine and the person on the phone was rude to me when I told him I wasn't sure of the machine model. As I was heading to the machine to look up the info I started to explain what part I was looking for. At this point he rudely interrupted me and told me there were hundreds of machines. I explained I was giving him some background to the part I was looking for and he hung up on me.

I called back and he continued to be rude and he exclaimed he didn't have parts for Cuisinart.

Would not recommend this place to anyone for anything!",1
8458,"I'm truly disappointed. I am visiting from Texas and this place was close to the home we were renting. Truly disgusting smelly soiled towels with gaping holes in them. They charged $55 for a subpar pedicure and there was an up charge for things that are generally standard. Huge disappointment. I do not recommend you visit this place. Yuck and yuck! Instead of glossy nails, it should be called grossy nails!",1
8460,I enjoy a meal here at least once per week and it's always enjoyable. I especially love the kind staff and the exceptional food that always satisfies our tastebuds.,5
8461,"This place is perfect for a meal after a workout! Quick. Clean. And most importantly,  delicious!",5
8462,"We have been twice to this place!! By far one of the best Indian Restaurants I have eaten at. We come to vegas every year for a convention and the last two years we have made a point to eat here... It is always a highlight of our trip!! Ask for Vick when you visit, he is the best.",5
8464,"We built a new home with a washer and dryer supplied by our builder, from Arizona Wholesale. The unit did not work when we moved in, in 2014. The dryer needed a new transmission, the washer wasn't spinning clothes properly and leaked during certain cycles. I don't know about you, but this doesn't sound like a new appliance...

The dryer was fixed and the spinning cycle was fixed, but anytime it run on a small, cold cycle, it leaks. Arizona Wholesale has sent companies out 5-6 times now to fix the issue and over a year later, it's still not solved.

We asked them to give us a new unit and they can continue working on theirs, or even take it and refund us so we can buy a unit elsewhere and they refuse. Apparently Whirlpool, wants them to send someone out again when we've been told after 4 services it would be replaced.

Its ridiculous that they are making this our problem when this unit hasn't worked properly from the beginning. 

I've requested a manager be present during our next repair and wait while we run a load during one of the cycles that's broken to be sure it's fixed. The saga continues...",1
8465,"By far my favorite ramen place! The food is excellent and the potions are perfect! I've never been disappointed from anything I was served. The staff is amazing as well, very polite and not super in your face like many waiters will be at other restaurants. Every ramen lover needs to try this place!",5
8466,"Great service every time! I get my nails done by Autumn, she does a great job!",5
8467,"Wow!  The food here is really, really good!!  We tried both the jerk chicken dinner (excellent) and the curry goat (amazing) and both left us wanting to return. Living downtown we've tried few caribbean restaurants but none compare to this.  Huge portions, really nice staff combined with delicious yet inexpensive food.  A definite five star. The place is in a divy-looking mall but don't be put off by that.  We ate in - very fast-foodish set up - but were comfortable and the place was very clean.  Lots of people were coming in asking for their jerk shwarma but they were all sold out. We overhead the lady saying over and over again that it's usually sold out by 5 pm, so if you want to try this, be forewarned!!",5
8468,"Just had a fantastic massage with therapist Arturo. I would absolutely recommend him to family, friends and co-workers!!
Having a few health issues and previous injuries, I get massaged regularly (1-3x monthly). I was flying in to PHX for a day and NEEDED a massage the next day, After reading reviews I called and requested either Annie or Arturo (on a Monday for a Tuesday appt). The person who answered took my info and request and called me back within 20 minutes letting me know if they could accommodate me. They could! He sent me an invoice via email which I paid for via PayPal (90 minute deep tissue plus parking came out to $127). The next day, Art came to my hotel, brought his table and worked on my troubled areas deep tissue and light stretching. Super nice guy, very professional, and very effective massage bodywork. Convenient payment was handled directly online and I tipped him in person. I will definitely book again the next time I'm here! 
My rating is based upon:
1. Convenience booking, 2. Therapist  3. Convenience of mobility",5
8469,"My wife and I spent 3 nights here for a conference and we loved it. The rooms are very quiet and extremely comfortable. The food service was incredible but expensive. You won't be disappointed in the pools, lazy river, and water slide. We were very impressed and would love to return. There's nothing I would change about our stay.",5
8471,"When you're in Vegas, you have to party. What better way to party, than to save money at the same time. We ventured down the street in search of a liquor store and market, and viola, to our surprise we found both!

At the St Tropez Convenience Mart, they have both a market and a liquor store, same building, just separated by a single wall. All of the workers we ran into, were all super friendly and amazingly helpful. After we had our beers and liquor in hand, we promptly went outside and began frivolously drinking. The woman behind the counter started  waving at us, and in a drunken stupor, we all started cheering and waving back, what a nice lady!

Moments later she runs outside with paper bags, and informs us that we can't drink hard liquor outside of a bag, and to make sure we keep it in the bag so we don't get into any trouble, wow, she is REALLY nice, and informative. We tell her thank you and before she can leave our side, we start drinking again and she promptly stopped us and told us we had to be at least a thousand feet from the liquor store so they don't get into trouble, too. We all told her thank you, good lookin out for us! So we crossed the street into the Hard Rock parking lot and kept the party going.

If you're looking for super friendly service, great prices, and just about anything you could want for late night drinking and snacking needs, this is the spot!",5
8472,I am from Michigan and I would have never guessed I could get an authentic pasty in the desert. Had the traditional pasty and it was delicious. Didn't think I could get it on the plane back to Las Vegas or I would have taken one to go,5
8473,Hilarious show! It is family friendly but I enjoyed it as an adult. A very fun way to spend an afternoon in Vegas!,5
8474,One of the best breweries in Charlotte. Can't go wrong with their Good Morning Vietnam brew. Staff is great. patrons are friendly.  Always a great time regardless of your age.,5
8475,"The gnocchi and ravioli was to die for!  Creamy, mouth watering and incredible. Great place to eat, relax and enjoy some amazing food options.",5
8476,"This place is seriously de-friggen-licious!!  My old roomie, a native of Mesa, took me here and I dream about coming here whenever it's hot (and that's most of the time if you're in the Phoenix-Scottsdale-Tempe-Mesa area).

Their shaved ice is super soft and fluffy.  They have a bagillion flavors and their cream is awesome!  You have to get it!  It is another 45 cents, I think, but don't think twice!  

I noticed some people said this was a dodgy location, but maybe I'm from the 'hood or something, cuz this place was NOT iffy at all!  If anything it is a little dim-lit at night, but really no big deal.

I wish I still lived in AZ just so I could enjoy Bahama Bucks on the daily!",5
8477,"I just love this place! Great food and the service is wonderful. You really feel like the staff cares about you. They recommended great food combinations and beer that made our experience better than if we would have just stuck to our normal Indian food order. I just moved here but this will be one of my ""go to"" places. Thank you Taj Palace.",5
8478,Great service. Awesome! The owner served us. He even made a chocolate covered waffle cone for my son. I grew up in San Diego where there were Thrifty's stores. This is still the same great ice cream I remembered. Definitely a place to check out!!!,5
8480,"Salmon sashimi - excellent.  Great texture, color and temp.  RA sushi should take a lesson from Blu and learn a thing or two!  Prompt and courteous service made the experience that much better.  Would recommend and will return.",5
8481,"Go with enterprise! Hertz lied to me multiple times about trying to get ahold of and deal with my insurance. Come to find out, they didn't try at all. A month after I had everything settled and covered by my insurance, they charged me almost $600 without a warning. They blamed the fact that they couldn't get ahold of progressive. When I talked to my adjuster she flipped out because she said she's made multiple phone calls every day to get my situation figured out when hertz told me they tried every day to get ahold of progressive, which she said never happened. I just find it insane that they don't call you before they charge you $600 a month after the car was returned. Now I have to drive to Parma to the progressive office to get a check from progressive so I can put it in my bank before I overdraw and accrue fees. Hertz is a shit show. And this isn't the first time they've let me down and inconvenienced me. GO WITH ENTERPRISE",1
8482,"I really wanted to like this salon. The first time I went there to get my hair done I had to go back twice for them to fix the color. I paid over $200.00 for it. Then, a few months later, I went back and tried to give them another chance by seeing a different hairdresser this time when I needed my hair done again. This time I paid $300.00 and I had to go back 3 times in one week for them to fix the color, and it still looks like crap. I even debated on leaving a review or not. I just kind of wanted to move on with my life because this place has exhausted me, taken a lot of my money, wasted a lot of my time, and wasted a lot of my gas. But ultimately I decided that I should leave a review because I don't want anyone else to have to waste that much money and time at this salon as I did, if they don't need to. Just go somewhere else for your hair. This place is not worth it at all.",1
8483,So far I have hi hopes. Well the service kicks ass. The first thing we had was the pumpkin bread. So effin good. I mean it was incredible. So soft it was like cake muffin I can't even explain it was so moist. They give you this butter to put on it also that was like a salty margarine that really complemented the bread. I got corned beef hash hash browns and eggs with a biscuit and gravy side. Was all hungover yes you're damn right I was this is Vegas. It was our last day and we had a coupon for this place. This isn't just a normal normal almond Haus it was the fifties version of an omelet house. When I got my food I could not believe how well the corned beef hash was prepared. My wife's all it was absolutely amazing. We could not believe how good the food was. I can't remember when the last time it was that we went to a breakfast place that's good. I promise you the next time we go to Las Vegas we will be going to The Omelet House 50s diner. It can't be beat. 499 599 1099 I did not care how much money we spent on this food. Although it was very cheap. I would pay double every day all day for that kind of food and that kind of service,5
8484,"I went in to see if there was a game for my son. Apparently there is a new game coming out called Destiny. There was a line with no less than 10 people waiting to pre-order. There was 4 other patrons including myself that were in need of help. With three cashiers, they could have dedicated 2 to the Destiny line and one to help the others. To top it off, the line was in front of all the xbox games and we couldn't even look around to pass time. Absolutely unacceptable. I will never return to this location. I know it makes no difference to that store because they will still make their money, but I will take my money to a more deserving business.",1
8485,"I've always wanted to try an arepa, but thought I'd have to go to a bigger city like New York or a city with a much larger Latino population. I was thrilled to find out about this place and eager to give it a try. I had the Steak and Hawaiian Arepas. Both were great on their own, but the sauces really put them over the top. My favorite was the garlic sauce followed closely by the chimichurri. Wish they sold the garlic sauce by the bottle. The pineapple sauce is a nice palate cleanser. The ranchero sauce is like a creamy ketchup. The peanut sauce was the only one I didn't care for since it was all heat and not much else. I hope that they will expand their menu to include more traditional fillings beyond the chorizo. I'm now a fan and can't wait to go back.",5
8487,"A favorite downtown bar for me! 

Location: This is on 2nd street and a bit hard to find if you don't know. The sign faces south. There is street or metered parking nearby. I am able to walk!

Food:  This is more than just bar food. I have had some of the salads, the hummus, pretzels, peanut butter sandwich, and the homemade poptart.  Everything has been tasty! The pizzas are excellent!  The pretzels are probably one of my favorites. They come with mustard and cheese.  I have also had the fries with gravy (not a fan). 

Drink: Multiple local / regional beers are featured, and the cider on tap changes daily.  I absolutely love the ginger cider and the cherry cider. One can order flights of beers of their choice. 

Service: For a busy bar, the service is quite good.  I have been at least seven times in the last year, and every single time, the server is checking up on us numerous times. The servers are friendly and helpful also. 

Ambiance: There are TVs near the bar, and there's an outside patio area for when it's nice out. They have some games out there, like corn hole ( I hate that name!) 

This place can get packed on Thursday and Friday evenings and weekends too.",5
8489,"Best decision we made to go with this Marina!! We did extensive research and this was the only lake near Pheonix/Scottsdale with a party boat. It was the besttttt party boat!! The just renovated it so it had a loud sound system and it was super clean and nice! They put a grill in there for us, so be sure to ask for that when you go! We had the best boat driver too! His name was Greg, and he took us to a private cove. There was a slide. We had it alll day 9am-5pm! What a deal. It was also very reasonably prices. This definitely made my bachelorette party a success. It was everyone's favorite part of the weekend. I definitely recommend this place!

I will say, it's a very quiet lake, so it depends on the vibe you are looking for.",5
8492,"If what Zella's makes is pizza and breadsticks then MacDonalds is a Michelin star restaurant. Pizza has a terrible crust and their breadsticks are more like tortillas than breadsticks. 
Based on what I received I will never try Zella's again. Pizza Hut is better. And Pizza Hut has never made anything that resembles a real pizza in its life.
The person on the phone was anything but cordial and welcoming. If this were my company, I would fire him immediatley. 
Zella's will not be around for long, unless they get help from Restaurant Impossible. Based on reading other reviews, Zella's is either very inconsistant or perhaps some buyers are not aware of what good pizza should be.",1
8495,The pharmacy has the best pharmaceutical doctors they explain how to and why and you leave there understanding!,5
8497,"The view is breathtaking. Was a bit small, but could have been because it was a Sunday. Perhaps, they close off a few area. 

The elevator ride was short, so it was perfect for those who are claustrophobic.",5
8498,"MENU:  http://www.mainelobsterlady.com/id1.html 

Her Hot Buttered Lobster Roll is worth EVERY penny.  It's about $19.00 and only comes with a bag of chips, dill pickle spear and a lemon wedge.  However, she doesn't skimp on the meat or butter, as most places do.  The lobster was fresh, warm, tasty, moist and simply delicious!  The sandwich was VERY filling.  The hot roll seemed to be grilled with garlic butter.  Roll was soft, but edges were crunchy.  You will need to use a fork to eat this sandwich otherwise you will have butter dripping down your hands and arms!  

Her Lobster Mac & Cheese is another popular dish.  Very cheesy, moist with LOTS of lobster chunks.  Her Traditional Style (cold) Lobster Roll is also very moist, fresh and seasoned well and is hugely popular!!  

I highly recommend The Maine Lobster Lady if you ever see her food truck!!  

Lobster Lady, please come back down to the State Capitol for Food Truck Fridays!!  WE LOVE YOU!!!",5
8502,"This place is hidden in a plaza and it's literally 2 min away from my place. I looked up yelp for a restaurants around my house to go with my girlfriend and checked out barrelhouse. Once you walk in, it doesn't feel like your in chandler. Great ambiance, great service and food was spectacular. I had the steak for my entree and my girlfriend had the lobster roleno both were amazing . We also had the driving scallops for small plate .. All together I give 5 star for food and service.",5
8504,"This place has been open for 4 days and they were already selling out of mains at noon!!!  I was in a line 8 people deep when the weather was -20. We did takeout... large poblano coleslaw, large smoked baked beans and a whole chicken for under $30. This is the BEST BBQ I have had in the city. We are replacing easy family pizza dinner for the Smokehouse. I can't wait to go back. 

Service is welcoming. And the place has a great feel.",5
8505,"""A midtown restaurant, nestled into a two story house, this place has been here for as long as I can remember. A Mediterranean seafood mecca, replete with erotica that makes you grin every time in spite of yourself, Joso's is not to be missed.""

8506,"I took my family from out of town here for dinner and we all enjoyed our meal! We sat outside and enjoyed the warm weather, and it was nice to know the heaters were above the tables for when the temperature dropped a bit. 

They have over 20 beers on tap, and you can get a sampler of 4 4.5oz beers for $9. They also have 'guest beers' that included bumbleberry in May. 

I had the salad with roasted strawberries and lemon vinaigrette with grilled chicken. The kitchen allowed me to substitute the cheese for a different type of cheese with no upcharge. My family ordered the burger, brisket, veggie burger and sausage pizza. Everyone enjoyed their food, and the veggie burger had avocado on it which was yummy! 

I've also been for brunch, and my guests LOVED the scotch eggs. They aren't easy to make so I was surprised to see them on the full menu! I'd recommend trying them if you want to try something different. It's an egg rolled in chorizo then breaded and fried-great to split between two people.",5
8507,Very rude customer service at this location! I chance it every time only because it's the closest one to my home but I rather drive the extra few miles to a different McDonald's! I've lived in this area for over a year & it's been a consist dissatisfaction! If you don't like you job maybe you shouldn't work there! That's a negative 1 star!,1
8510,"Such a cute little shop in Montreal's Chinatown!  They have all sorts of steamed buns that are in too cute for words buns!  They're also too cute to eat!  They also have some staple HK/Canto Style foods along with a plethora of bubble tea/drink options.  

The place is nice and bright and clean.  It's a perfect little spot for a snack or meal.  

One word of caution though, you have to come during the main part of the day, not too early or too late because not all of the baos will be available.  I learned the hard way =(",5
8511,Absolutely fantastic vegan grub! They have amazing GF & Vegan food. The pad Thai is amazing! The burgers & fries were great. Everything was fantastic! My team that was in Vegas working a trade show ordered food here every day! Seriously amazing food!!,5
8512,"Two of the manicurists are great.  I do like the place and they remove and wash filters in the foot baths - an absolute MUST.  On the down side, the MANAGER is a tough, unfriendly and unaccommodating woman.  The owner is KIM, but it is a well-kept secret..  Any time ther is an issue, KIM sends the MANAGER to handle it and KIM remains anonymous.  I have had nails ruined because they rush me out the door and then they will not compensate me with a free manicure or a refund.  I don't need to go to a mani/ped place where I do not feel welcomed by the MANAGER.",1
8513,"Lox stock is my favorite bagel place in town.  They do some wonderful catering also.  I always avoid the typical chain restaurants and while it may be hard to try a new place, you will be happy with the food at Lox Stock.  Let the boring and unadventerous go elsewhere.  It is quite possible the bagels at Lox Stock are the best you will find west of the Hudson River!",5

8522,"The Icehouse is a great example of adaptive use in downtown Phoenix.  From it's origins producing ice used to ship produce farmed in the Valley by rail to eastern consumers, it has be resurrected as a multi-use space.

While first and foremost an art  gallery -- and it's diversity of interior and exterior spaces make it a great place for large scale installation work as well as more intimate showings -- it is also a unique space for all sorts of events from indie rock concerts to corporate fundraisers (and would make an AMAZING place for a wedding ceremony and reception!)",5
8524,"EXCELLENT PLUS SIZE COLLECTION!!!!!!!!!!!

Had a great experience here!  Holly was awesome, she was very patient even though she knew I was not buying a dress that day.  I think I found my dress there! it is probably the ONE!  the one for the cruise and my 20th anniversary.  I am happy.  I did not expect to get this kind of service in this kind of shop so I was very pleasantly surprised.  the prices are good, and the variety is awesome!  I recommend it.  If you are looking to be completely catered to, this is not for you.  But if you are on a budget and looking for a great dress, and decent service, this is for you.  GREAT PLUS SIZE SELECTION!!!!  

good luck!

8525,"I am not sure why there are so many bad reviews of this place.... The food is simple (burgers, salads, fries) but OH so good!! We also got beer flights, which were enjoyable, and desserts were out of this world!! We came with a 20% off coupon from the clipper coupons, and a dinner for four ended up being a $100 tab!! Highly recommended and coming back next time for Build-Your-Own burgers.",5
8531,"I just finished this and I can honestly say it was one of the worst meals I have had in recent memory. The mac and cheese made a cheap Velveeta dinner seem high class. It was bland with a cheese ""sauce"" and I put it in quotes because that is as close as I could come to identifying it. For the burger to offer options on a temperature of your choosing is a joke as it comes as well done as a fast food burger. It had so few onion straws that we didn't believe they were included until we pulled it apart and realized there was a light orange color where the straw batter is assumed to have been though no actual straws were found. Now the real gem, the meat loaf. This is the equivalent of a kid cuisine meal except in a kid cuisine you get a dessert and the corn doesn't suck. They also flat out forgot the salad that is listed on the website as included with the meatloaf though they charged us a $1.50 for as if we added it and then didn't even include it in our bag. This, like serial killers, proves that some things are bad through and through. ~",1
8532,"I'm beyond happy I found this place. I love the subway/chipotle model of food where you just go down a line and pick what you want! 
And this food is fantastic. 

Like seriously... Bro! I got so much food for like $10. I got steak, chicken, pig, Mac salad and rice for $10! Man! Was this food good too.

You know a place is good when it open at 10:30 and you get there at 10:34 and there are already 5 customers sitting and eating in the restaurant. 

Kalua Pig was the best thing in my opinion! My second favorite was the Katsu Chicken. Both of these items I will get over and over again! 

Great place. I'll be back!",5
8535,"Where do I begin. My 3 year old roof that I paid almost $11k for has buckled, shingles blew off and is now leaking. With an alleged 10 year warranty. Of course when I called they say it's wind damage do they don't have to cover under the warranty which is basically useless. The warranty covers poor workmanship send that's exactly what it is. My neighbors had no roof damage from the last storm send their roofs are much older than mine. What ever happened to roofs lasting 20-30 years?  Now I have to call my insurance out and pay $1,000 deductible due to poor workmanship. Titan doesn't stand behind their work. And the girls in the office could care less, they never return calls either. 
Horrible experience.",1
8538,"Wife and I were craving a burger and The Hub did not disappoint. We went on a Friday around 5pm and the place was packed. Has the standard bar food plus some other selections that help this place stand out. Our waitress was very kind (and very busy) and took the time to chat with us. Found out it was our first time there and brought us out a little treat on the house! Those kind of actions go a long way.

I could definitely see going back for a sports game as this place was full of TV's and seemed to have a good atmosphere. Felt like there were quite a few loyal customers there - which is usually a good sign.",5

8550,"I will try and keep this short, but I wasted 4 days trying to talk to someone to get some help. I had paid in full for a economy car @ $12.99 per day. Got to the counter and he told me he was giving me a car with more leg room. No mention of an upgrade cost. I thanked him and mentioned i get upgraded often because they do not have the car I have paid for. The upgrade cost for the next bigger size car was $10 per day, almost a 100% up charge. I was never shown anything of told about the $10 per day charge. He printed up the paperwork, folded it up and put it in a folder and wrote the space number on the outside. The next morning I got an alert that my AMEX card was charged $304. I then looked inside the folder and saw the additional charge of $10 per day upgrade charge. I immediately called the 800 number and was told he could do nothing while I still had the car, but would have someone from the corporate office call me back. That never happened...The next day I called and was told I had to call the location where i rented the car. Over the next 2 days I call the airport location 8 times, never had someone answer the phone, and i left a message to please call me. no body ever called me. I then called the 800 number again and got a lady from ???? country. And she told me I had to take the car back to where I rented it. 3 hours away, or take it to a local office that has an economy car. I asked if she could tell me if one of the 4 locations within an hour of me had an economy car and she said she could not and it was my responsibility to look up the locations and call each one to find out if they had a car. I spent 45 minutes doing that and none had an economy car. I called the 800 number got someone from ?????? country and asked a very specific question. Is there anyone at hertz I could talk to that had the authority to help me,,,and was told NO,,,I asked again and was told NO I had to deal with the office i rented from. When I returned my car to the airport it was 4:45 am and my flight left at 6 am. I was told no one would be at the counter until 5:30. My plane was boarding at 5:30 so that would not work. I called hertz when i got home and told my long story to a lady and she said that she could only give me a 50% refund. I told her i was going to file a dispute with AMEX and she said if i did that i might have a problem renting from hertz again. I told her there are plenty of other car rental companies and I would not be using hertz again...Soooooooooooooooooo if you are ever upgrade and they make it sound like they are doing you a favor ask if you are being charged for the courtesy upgrade and ask to see paperwork before you sign anything....Sorry for the long story....I left out some more phone calls talking to people that could do nothing to help....",1
8551,"Ok, so there is another teharu in Scottsdale and it is AMAZING. Literally one of my favorite places to get cheap sushi that's still delicious. So when I heard they were opening one closer to my house I was like ""score! This is gonna be great"" but, sadly, it was not. I've gone here three times at three different times of day and each time the sushi was lukewarm and the wait staff was rude. I get that you take your chances with conveyer belt sushi and sometimes a roll just isn't gonna be great because they're not busy and it's been sitting out for a while. It's a risk I'm willing to take, but at the other teharu if you ask them to make you a fresh roll they happily oblige whereas at the one at superstition springs, if you ask them for a fresh order of anything (or even for a refill!) they act like its the biggest inconvenience in the world. 

On top of that, the people who work there are just straight up rude. They usually take a while to pick up the check, which is annoying but not a huge problem, except for last night when I was there with my sister and brother who has special needs. My brother got sick halfway through our meal so my sister took him out to the car and gave me her card to pay for her food. So I'm sitting there, waiving at the waitress constantly and she ignores me for about five minutes before coming over and simply responding with ""what?"" I ask her for the checks and she goes to get them. When she comes back with the checks, she hands them to me and asks ""so are they coming back or what?"" And I told her ""no, my brother just got sick so they're waiting for me in the car. I have the debit cards right here though."" Then I go to hand her the checks back and she walks away! I watch her go up to the front and pull out her phone so I go up there and I was like ""my brother is really not feeling well so can I get these checks taken care of?"" To which she responded ""I just gave them to you. Why are you being so impatient??"" That's when I just about lost it on her :) 

So...safe to say I will not be going back. I'll stick to ahi in Gilbert or make the drive to teharu Scottsdale. It's worth it.",1

After confirming on the phone and sending several emails confirming the contract, price, and time, the vehicle showed up an HOUR AND A HALF LATE to our wedding. Keep in mind, we had ordered this for our grand exit with sparklers. There was no car to go to and all of our guests had already left by the time they eventually showed up. As soon as the driver got out of the car, he looked at us (only my husband, me and the photographer left) and said, ""oh, am I late?"" After driving us to or destination, which he didn't even know where he was going - we had to direct him, he apologized and promised us a refund. It is now a month later, we have only received half of the refund, my husband and I have both been emailing and calling Matt everyday and he has yet to respond or tell us when our refund will be sent to us. It is absolutely absurd and appalling that he could run a business like this.",1

8562,"Best products! Best prices. Hands down. My boyfriend went in to browse the e-cigarettes. We have tried them before and had bad luck.  First, the owner opened door ten minutes early for him and happily welcomed him inside. The store clerk really took the time to talk to to my boyfriend and help make the right decision on what E-cigarette would meet his needs. Once they found the e-cig he liked the store clerk (who we found out was owner) walked my boyfriend through step by step how to work and maintain the e-cig. I've been around to plenty of smoke shops trying to find a good e-cig and high quality fluid with a price tag that isn't ridiculous. We found it! They even have an awesome ""bar"" where you can try different flavors. The service wasn't what we would have ever expected from a smoke shop. It's not a bunch of young adults with a attitude or a pushy sales guy with questionable merchandise. This is a local owned business with a great owner!!

Go, check it out!",5
8564,We got a flat tire Friday night and needed it repaired or replaced ASAP. Called White's simply to support our local businesses and were more than happy with their service! Joanne and Annie were very pleasant to deal with and Tom repaired our tire very quickly! I appreciated their honesty and not trying to sell me a new tire. They even gave me the culprit that caused me my flat-an old rusty screw. Would definitely recommend!,5

Asked her to send the manager out and she said he would be out in just a minute...well....10 minutes passed and no manager so I buzzed the buzzer and got a gentleman who said he was the manager, so I told him the issue and he never once offered to fix anything or rectify the problem. Told him the we wouldn't be back and his reply was ok, amd clicked off the speaker! This manager definately needs to some training on how to run his crew and how to deal with the public!",1

8567,"If you are looking for service, this is definitely NOT the place to go. It definitely misses the concept of what a restaurant ought to be. The attitude and ambiance of what it means to sit in and dine at a restaurant is far below standard. We arrived at the restaurant with several empty tables. Seating took another 15 minutes. Once seated, we weren't served our drinks until after the tables that arrived after ours got theirs and neither was our order taken until after theirs even though I had notified our waiter that we were ready to order. I do not care if he is the owner's son but to hold such a pretentious attitude at a family owned restaurant is rather un-classy. I've withheld judgement the two previous times that I have visited the restaurant always giving the benefit of the doubt that they were just understaffed or there were too many customers. But, as a diner, I feel that there is just a certain number of bad quality treatment that a customer can take. Needless to say, we walked out after paying for our drinks. Needless to say, I won't be back. I much rather pay a premium and eat at Roka Akor or ShinBay than sit through mediocre sushi and poor service.",1

You honestly can't make a wrong choice here, but I highly recommend the ribs and the brisket. 

The music is also super stellar.",5

Nothing like getting a lecture on insurance and Arizona liability law from a high pressure sales person disguised as a customer service representative.  Finally had to ask them; ""please do not ask me the same question again"". 

More, there were no other customers at the service desk and it still took them 20 minutes to process my reservation.  In fairness to Fox, I am frequent renter at PHX and Dollar and Thrifty are just as bad.   Enterprise is usually pretty good but their rates tend to be higher.",1

8595,"Came to eat here with my boyfriend and I'm so glad we did!!! The atmosphere was very relaxed, calm, clean and the staff are extremely nice!

We ordered the chicken to start off with (it starts with a k... karage? I totally butchered it up) and we each got a bowl of the spicy miso and the other spicy bowl of ramen (tankono? My spelling is horrible today) but regardless of my horrible spelling the food was amazing!!! 

The chicken was nice, crispy and extremely juicy on the inside. We both agreed that it was one of the most deliciously juicy chicken we've ever had. Our ramen were both delicious and fresh! The spiciness wasn't enough to get you panting and dripping sweat but it was enough to help clear both our sinuses! The noodles were fresh and had the amazing texture of freshness to it- not too firm but not too chewy and the egg in each of our soups were cooked to perfection! The broth of each soup was rich in flavor and mine had an extremely delicious creaminess to it- you can tell they cooked my broth for awhile to get the soup the way it was!

All of our food came out extremely quickly and the serving size was just right- enough to make you full but enough for you to be hungry for your next meal. Each bowl of ramen was about $7.95 to 8.95 which isn't bad at all for wonderful service and delicious food.

All in all, definitely coming back here again when we're near this side of town!!",5
8596,"Growing up eating fast food and then in high school working out and packing burgers and nuggets, weren't enough to exclude the lack of ingenuity and service this McDonald's can provide.  There are some other locations that look much nicer and and have better customer service.  McDonald's been going downhill with my tastebuds.  You can go anywhere else with fast casual gigs or if anything in n out xD",1
8597,"I found this place to be total heaven!
We ordered the tacos and the zucchini pasta with a cashew sauce. The cashew sauce was out of this world and I can only hope I can make something like his remotely close at home!  So delicious! There were plenty of left overs as well. I have zero complaints about this place. I did not notice to much salt either but they are so friendly, I am sure they would make you something else if you don't care for your food.
I ordered a couple of her e cookbooks as well! Yum!",5
8598,"Glad we found this place! There was a line, but we were sitting down in less than 5 min. Menu is extensive having breakfast, lunch and dinner. Prices range from $13 and up.

For some it may be to loud but we loved it! Definitely coming again....",5
8599,"There was a nice mix of indoor/ outdoor horticulture, and it was laid out really well. The kid's area outside was really neat. We liked the Broderie Room (Cacti) as well as the Tropical Spice Room. The Butterfly Room was nice, too.

Will definitely be back to try more!",5

Also we tried the rock shrimp and spinach salad and the crispy rice with spicy tuna. All of it was excellent. There was at least 10 big shrimp on the salad, the steak in the teriyaki bowl was delicious and top quality. My husband's spicy tuna bowl was so yummy and the portion size was more than we expected. I am so happy we stopped in! We will definately be back for more.",5

Food wasn't great

I had 20 dollars in songs on the juke box skipped over. 

Bought drinks only to have a bouncer tell us it was closing time literally 2 minutes after we were handed the drinks and that we had to leave, In this case my friend sternly dressed him down and the guy left us alone.

This is 3 separate trips,  3 negative experiences. 

Don't waste your time, goto one of the other perfectly fine bars on walnut street",1

The coffee shop aesthetic, the combination of the smell of ice cream and coffee, the friendly service, there is an experience to be had here.   This is also hands down the best Ice Cream shop in the neighborhood....without question.  The choices of flavors are homemade and constantly rotate, this keeps things interesting, but if you are like my daughter you can still always get Vanilla (with sprinkles if you wish) still.   I would say as far as Ice cream goes the prices are steep compared to say Bruesters or a Dairy Queen, but what you are getting is so much better that it's worth paying a couple dollars more to take the family, besides if you are having ice cream you already have decided to indulge youraelf, do it right.",5
8631,Unbelievable! If we could give more stars we could! From the moment we walked in we fell in love with the ambiance and service. And the food.... OMG!

Anthony, our server, was very attentive and friendly, and Tommy stopped by several times to check on us as well. The food was perfect- we will definitely be back!",5
8637,"Favorite breakfast place in the city, worth parking downtown for.   Hash browns are great, anything with fruit is great, and I do like the Mac and Cheese (really not how Mom made it).  Definitely worth going to, and worth the wait (if you get there later in the morning).",5
8638,The best so far on the strip. I tried the famous one at Bellagio. Was very watery and tasteless. I stopped twice already at  the Hexx and just love it. They make chocolate right here.

The good news is the food is wonderful. I have been to Rosario's many times and have had a good taste bud experience.

Bad news, the service is TERRIBLE. If you have two hours to kill and are okay with being thirsty and hungry then Rosario's is your place. I found the waiters to be sarcastic and uneducated about their menu.

In my personal experience, my order has been confused with another person, I have not received the salad that comes with my meal twice, had to ask for the bread that comes with the meal, been charged extra for items that are supposed to be included with the meal and waited an average of 40 minutes for a simple entree. 

It is too bad because the food is good enough to want to go back to Rosario's, but the service is so horrible that you would have to pay me for the time lost.",1

8645,"What a nice place to dine!  The food, the server is so good!  My husband and I are celebrating our anniversary there, both of us enjoy a lot! The duck is a must!",5
8647,"I had called around and no one willing to take on my job. I called Billie and what a blessing I have found my handy person for life. She is an Awesome down to earth person, Good Old fashion customer service and with great experience and knowledge.What surprise me the most was that she called me back in less then 30 mins, came over the next day and called to lets us she would be arrive in 10 mins right on time.  She was very helpful and honest. I Highly recommend Billie.",5
8649,"The minute you walk in the door of the building, you know you are in for a treat!  The smell of Hazelnuts' crepes cooking should be bottled and sold.

I work next door to Hazelnuts and it has become one of my go-to spots for an awesome meal.  I always get a chicken pesto crepe and it is always perfect.  They are very generous with the toppings and the crepe definitely fills you up (and I have a hearty appetite)!  There are small touches that they do that make the crepes stand out, like melting the cheese completely and adding salt/pepper on the finished product.  The owner is always there and is extremely friendly.   I am looking forward to trying one of their sweet crepes in the near future!",5
8651,"I'm not a huge fan of raw food, so I wouldn't scream ""tasty!"" to any of their menu items. However, if I were to recommend anything at this restaurant - I would definately go for their pizza. Also, you especially cannot leave this restaurant without trying their gluten-free, dairy-free cheesecake. TO DIE FOR. I return to this restaurant specifically for their cheesecake. It's obviously on the pricy side, for the portion that you get, but considering how many almonds go into this delightful tasty thing, it's worth every penny.",5
8653,"The atmosphere is nothing special, the food tasted like warmed up leftovers. My daughter found a hair in her burrito and I paid $35.00 for basically a terrible experience. We had so much food leftover that stayed right there in the restaurant because we weren't taking that garbage home. 
I suggest a whole revamping of this restaurant and for the doors to be shut immediately. Yuck with a side of yuck.",1
8654,"My family and I have gone to this restaurant for years and have always enjoyed it. Last nights service was absolutely terrible. I understand it was cinco de mayo and was busy and we expected that. Around 5 we called and asked what the wait time was for a table in the restaurant for 9 and we were told about an hour. We asked if they could put our name down as we would be heading up there right then and they said no they couldn't do that over the phone we had to be there to put our name down. So 5:20 we get there and put down Katy for a party of 9. Around 6 we asked how it was looking and they said about another 30 minutes. 6:30 comes around and we ask and they said ""we are still waiting on some tables to get up"" we continue waiting outside as we hear parties of 2,3,5 get called in for seating. 7 we ask again, do you know about how much longer? We are told they are still waiting on tables to open. We ask for some waters outside for us and the girl who brought them out walked away rolling eyes as we tried asking about our table. I get it was busy and maybe frustrating we kept asking, but it had been nearly 2 hours.  At 7:20 again we ask, we are told there is a party of 12 ahead of us now because they called in and put their name down. Immediately we are frustrated as we are told you don't do that. So my husband is asking why? We were told you can't do that?? And the girl in the front with the black shirt and long blonde hair in a pony tail, who was anything but nice, rudely says ""well I don't know I just work here"" so we ask to speak to the manager. The manager, woman in a green dress with brown hair, comes over and we explain the situation and she says they called us a while ago. That she was even outside calling us. I told her that's not true, we watched her coming outside calling people never once called us and I'm sorry but there were 9 of us, if you truly called someone would have heard. Or every 15-30 min we went inside wouldn't someone had said oh we just called you rather than sending us away saying they were waiting on tables to clear for us? But she continued to argue saying she called us and said they would figure something out for us. Then she says she's sorry because there has been some confusion up front, clearly realizing they were wrong. So finally we are seated in a booth with two high top chairs at the end. Not the most comfortable but we didn't care at that point. Our server was very nice and quick to serve us which we appreciated and they did order a couple cheese crisps for us since we had been waiting so long which was nice. So we finally got to order and eat. By the time we left (which was right after we ate since it was so late) was 9:30. 4 hours of being there. Again I know it's a busy day, but seems a little absurd and the service in the front by the host and manager was uncalled for.",1
8656,"Very disappointed in the food.  Had the special.  Scallops with risotto and asparagus.  Risotto was like mud, too thick to eat.  Asparagus may have well have been raw.  The scallops were seared unevenly and had bits of sand on them. Yuck.  I will not try this place again.  For the high price the quality was low.",1

I had a wonderful experience and the staff were very friendly and professional. I would def recommend this to anyone! their prices are unmatched by anyone, and so is their HD ultrasounds!!  Miracle in progress rocks!! I wouldn't go anywhere else :)",5
8664,"We recently had our wedding reception here.  I have nothing but absolutely wonderful things to say about Lorie and Maura.  They were so easy to work with, returned every phone call, and made me feel perfectly at ease.  They even helped me negotiate fees with vendors.  The site is a little pricey, but I feel it is worth every penny.  The fifth floor room is enormous, it has a space for cocktail hour, and a balcony with a beautiful view.  you're also allowed in the museum exhibits for pictures with your photographer.  I try to convince everyone I know who is getting married, even strangers, to have their reception there.",5
8665,"This will be a review for Dr. Holman Chan and then a review for Dr. Thomas Vater......

DR. CHAN:  

Dr. Chan helped our grown daughter after she had a head-on accident with a semi.  He is a perfectionist, an artist in his craft, very well respected in the orthopedic and surgical community, thoroughly explains everything (in layman's terms if needed),  and is a kind person, to boot.

Although Dr. Chan is a foot and ankle specialist, he not only did surgery on both her tibia and fibula near the ankle, he also did an excellent job on her wrist and arm bones.  He gave us excellent advice when consulting us on some prior surgeries, as well, involving her femur and knee.

We can't express how grateful we are to Dr. Chan.  He is definitely a light in the dark tunnel of recovery she is going through.

DR. THOMAS VATER:

Dr. Vater was also one of our daughter's orthopedic physicians following her head-on with a semi.  She had a mild compression fracture, which did not require surgery, thankfully.

We first saw Dr. Vater at UMC after our daughter was brought into trauma there via helicopter.  He was very focused and professional in dealing with her.  He explained everything well, gave her/nurses instructions on positioning and movement limiting, and immediately prescribed a brace for her right away to limit any future damage and to keep the area stable while it healed, which it did very quickly.  He's very serious about his work; it is obvious when he's studying x-rays, asking her questions, and answering our questions and concerns thoroughly.  We felt very safe with him caring for her.",5
8666,Came by here today with my boyfriend. We didn't get our hopes up but it exceeded our expectations after we killed the seafood boil. There was just one guy doing everything - cooking to serving so props to him. You can choose the spice and the seasoning - we chose spicy which was perfect for our taste. The closest seafood boil I had was at Wu's on South Blvd but this place is just waaayyyyy better. My boyfriend is a corporate chef and it's hard for him to love a place but he approves! Definitely will return - I'm still craving it!,5
8669,"Great customer service and always clean has been our experience over the last 8 months.  We have had 3 different units, 2 air conditioned and 1 regular unit.  We have had to switch units for different reasons and it is always easy and flawless.  Property is always clean inside and out and floors shine.  To date this is one of the best storage facilities we've ever used.",5
8670,We recently purchased security cameras for our apartment complex from Best Defense. The customer service has been great from the start and the cameras are very high quality. I especially like Digital Watchdog since it is so user friendly. Best Defense has changed the sense of well-being for our staff and residents. I would highly recommend them!,5
8671,"Before coming here  we read the reviews and were excited about the experience. That was the last time we were excited throughout our time dining here. Upon arrival not a single server was in the tavern. We waiting about ten minutes to be seated. Finally the bartender came out and seated us. We waited to order about another ten minutes. Our order was finally taken. The appetizer of the tater tots was good. However our burger was over cooked, our sweet potato fries were cold, and the side of ranch came after we were done eating. She also never came around to check on the meal.  Overall, we would not recommend this establishment. Food was disappointing as was the lack of service.",1

8675,"Simply put overrated. My steak was almost rare, I asked for med well. The hostess tried to sit us twice and left us standing in the bar area waiting on the table to be cleaned for 5 minutes.  We had reservations as well. The only thing good was fast service. I guess it doesn't take long to cook a rare steak.",1
8676,"Pricy, $35 & gave me diarrhea for two days. Suffering in the bathroom with pain. One of the reasons why I am vegan now. No need to eat expensive diarrhea food when I can do it for less than $10 at McDonalds! Unfair comparison. I had McDonald's food many times and only gave me a one day diarrhea not two.",1
8677,"Saw this when I was looking for a club to go to while in Vegas. Initially I thought it was a fake site but then I checked out the reviews and decided to give it a try. I must say, it was the best thing we could have done! We signed up for the guest list at Hakassan at the MGM Grand for Saturday night. I received a text with the check in instructions. Arrived at 10 and there was a dedicated line for those on the guest list. Showed my i.d. and they had my info there. They gave us a piece of paper to give to the cashier and we were in. Easy peasy. I will use this site whenever I'm in Vegas.",5
8678,A good hamburger is one of my favorite meals.  Throw in some good sides and done!!  I ordered the Know Poblano burger and my wife ordered a basic salad with chicken.  Also got sweet potato tots and french fries to go with it.  The burger was amazing-perfectly cooked and the toppings did not outweigh the taste of the meat.  And the tots were on another level.  No complaints whatsoever about Rehab Burger.,5
8679,"Our experience was great!  Our purchase went very smoothly and we were happy to leave with the deal and payments we were looking for. Cory, Tony and the rest of the Toyota of Surprise team that worked with us were all professional, helpful and friendly.",5

8683,"I ordered a down filled puffer coat on eBay that was very rare and when it arrived it was huge on me. I started searching for a tailor in Toronto that would be capable of basically remaking the whole coat in order for it to fit me. I was absolutely blown away by the job that was done at Magic Tailor. They did it in two days and it would be impossible to tell that it was ever touched, even though the whole jacket was essentially taken apart. I am extremely picky and like everything perfect, as I work in the fashion industry myself. I dealt with the owner who was beyond kind and extremely knowledgeable. I could not be more thrilled with my experience at Magic Tailor and I will return again and again.",5
8686,"I went there for a late dinner and we wanted to sit at a booth in the dining area but my friend wanted one of the specials you can only get at the bar.  I don't like that you can only get certain specials if you sit by the bar, especially when the place is some what empty, they should allow you those specials anywhere you sit.  It's a pretty ugly atmosphere, dark and boring.  

My friend and I sat at a high table close to the bar, and at that end they had a cart for dirty dishes sitting just across from us, gross!  but just wait it get's worse... I ordered the bacon wrapped scallop pasta with salad and garlic bread, and my friend ordered the pizza special.  Her pizza was dried out and nasty, and one of my bacon wrapped scallops had a hair wrapped into it. YUM YUM, I love eating other people's hair!  the pasta with my dish was pretty bland and boring.  

The salad that came with my dish was a ceasar with way too much dressing and when I asked for less on the next one they gave me none, also when the waitress brought another salad serving she didn't offer me cheese on top and completely disappeared, I literally had to go to the bar and get the cheese shredder myself and shred my own cheese.  

I wish I could give it a 0/5 but apparently that's not a possibility so it's a 1/5 for their.. um, well the garlic bread was good.  Never going here again though!",1
8687,"This place is gross! My kids were covered in ants and we had to move to another table! 15 minutes later he came to take our order. 25 minutes later her brought our drinks, we asked how long till our order would be ready and he said shortly.  20 minutes later I went up to the counter to ask if it was going to be done in the next 5 minutes because we were going to leave. The manager said we just put the orders in the over and it would be another 20 minutes.  Then he asked what flavor were the wings that we ordered.  I told he we are leaving and he said sorry!   One hour and 30 minutes of my family's time was waisted! I will never go there again!!!",1
8692,"We visited the location around 3:30 to grab an early dinner. We and two other couples came in around the same time. We stood at the front for almost three minutes without a soul greeting us. There were two tables in the restaurant, but no server, bartender or hostess could be seen the entire time we waited. We ended up leaving, but I decided to call the restaurant and call the manager. While he was very apologetic and offered to purchase something if we returned, we decided not to based on past reviews of service.",1
8694,Had the rose (which was $5! What the world?) and the chicken and dumplings which were phenomenal! I've never had chicken and dumplings with so much Rich non-overwhelming flavor before!  Can't wait to go back! My friend got a salad and it smelled so fresh! Great spot! Wonderful environment and fabulous service,5
8697,"I cannot say enough good things about our experience with the Olmstead Team. We're first time home buyers and had no idea what to expect. From the beginning with house searches and touring to the end when we signed our paperwork, the team made us feel important, informed and excited about the life decision we were about to make. We specifically were especially pleased with Mark Wyant and Monica who were available to us 24/7 and quite honestly, we still keep in touch to this day. Their knowledge not only about the home buying process but about Homes in general was extremely impressive. They truly are not only the best real estate professionals, but we consider them friends. I could go on and on about all the good things we experienced with our team but I would recommend them to anyone looking to buy or sell a home and cannot thank them enough for making our dreams a reality.",5
8698,Great gift store in the heart of First & Main. Parking is close and store is packed with lady centered booty! Went in with an open mind and just a need for Cleveland items. Staff were super helpful and found a unique item to put in a gift basket.,5
8699,Nothing like the California Islands. Worst service ever. The chili cheese fries were soggy and looked and tasted like they had been sitting in grease all day before being thrown into the broiler to heat them up...and had been saved all day to be disguised under chili. 20 min later I was finally able to say something to the server when she came back. No I don't want more. I waited another 20 for my 5 chicken tenders. Not to mention the iced tea was water.,1

8701,"Just left this place. I called ahead and was told the wait would be about 15 minutes, and that was fairly accurate. The doctor I saw, doctor Randall (Randy) was great. Can't remember the last name. He immediately gave me something for my nausea, explained to me why I was feeling so extremely dizzy, and wrote and filled my prescription on site. He was a kind of east coast, straight to the point kind of guy. In any case, I wasn't there long and they solved my problem.",5
8703,I love this local business. The groomers are always great and the retail associates are very helpful.  They have the fresh treats made daily that are absolutely adorable. They also have multiple locations which make it very convenient.,5
8704,"Really enjoyed the vibe in this place....seemed like a little getaway from the casino atmosphere, but right outside the Luxor in the shopping area.  They had a great authentic Irish band playing.  The Prime Rib was fantastic.  Wasn't so cool on the broccoli salad - too much raw broccoli.  Wait staff were perfect.  Would definitely recommend.",5
8706,"Really, really good and more or less reasonably priced authentic szechuan food.  Good, especially if you're in the area: as a McGill student I go here all the time with friends.  Be prepared to wait in line a little on weekend nights though because there isn't a tonne of seating.",5
8707,"My go-to place when I'm homesick and need my doubles & banana solo fix! 

The doubles and phoulorie are delicious! They make their food very comparable to food back in the Caribbean. They have great beverage selections just like back home in good ole Trinidad. 

Ambience isn't 5 star but it's exactly what you get when going into roti shops in Trinidad. No complaints from me though, the owner is very pleasant to me and my friends. The food is delicious. The tamarind sauce is my favorite!!! I recommend this place to all my fellow Trinis and friends who want food as authentic as it gets in Toronto. 

Trust me, I've scouted all over the GTA for good doubles and roti, this place is hands down the most authentic and the best.",5
8709,"If there was a no stars button, then this place deserves it. I found a car on Autotrader that I was interested in. Talked to a sales rep from the dealership at 7:30pm August 21, 2015 about wanting to come see the car. Since the dealership closes at 8pm there was no way I could have made the hour and a half drive there that evening. Kateland said no problem I can put the car on hold. We even discussed final price after fees in order to make sure the car was in my budget. She set me an appointment for 4:30pm the next day August 22. As to not make a long drive there for no reason I called at 3pm on the 22nd before making the drive up there. I talked to a different lady to confirm the car was there. She pulled up my information using my phone number and told me yes the car was here and they were looking forward to meeting me. Upon arriving at the dealership I told the sales rep my name and which car I was there to buy. After having to come back and ask my name again and telling me he thought the car was sold a manager came over and informed me that the car that was on hold for me and confirmed to be there an hour and a half ago was sold the night before???? All they asked was if there was another car they could help me with. They were not interested in fixing their mistake just selling cars.",1
8710,The food was incredible.  Also the service was stellar.   Everyone was so friendly and quick to answer any questions we had!   The buffet had a lot of variety!  We will definitely come back!,5
8711,"If I could give this place 10 stars I would. This place has the best wait staff and the food is awesome. Having moved from Texas we were looking for some authentic Mexican food, and we definitely found it here. The atmosphere is nice as well; it's very laid back plus they have a live singer. What more could you ask for? All around it was an great experience that I will be doing again and again. This place made me miss home.",5
8712,"This place is AWESOME!!! I'm in Cleveland for a LEGO event with my mom, and she is a vegetarian. I picked this place because of all the great reviews. All the great reviews were right. It's a cozy little place with very friendly service. I had the Cuban Panini sandwich, and mom had the marinated tofu wrap. Both of our meals are HUGE and VERY tasty!!!  We both enjoyed the meal very much. Next time I'm in Cleveland, I will have to come back to try the other menu items.",5

They ripped the skin off my pinky and it bled for almost 20 minutes and the lady tried to make it stop bleeding by putting nail glue on my finger...needless to say I just wanted to get out so I let it go. My nail is painted with dry blood surrounding it and I'm unable to wash the dry blood away seeing as it's covered with nail gel. 

My pedi was also not great! She glopped the nail polish on so it looks like a large pink puddle on my big toe! It also has something like white debris that dried on it that she had to of seen but didn't feel like fixing. I am deeply disappointed and hope that my finger doesn't become infected because if it does they will have a bigger problem than this review!",1

When you tell a customer that her job will be done in 5 hours, then the customer leaves and comes back in 8 hours, only to be told by a rude service guy that the car isn't ready but only like ""to bad but"".  This guy really has alot to learn about service.  This guy really needs to apologize, this jerk needs to appreciate his job.  This dealership doesn't get it, this dealership really shouldn't be allowed to operate.  This dealership need to be reviewed by the Ford Motor Company.  You can rest assured this review will be looked at by alot of people.  This incident happened today, September 19, 2017",1
8732,LOVED LOVED my experiance! My poor Schnauzer was such a mess! I have been looking to find a groomer since I moved to gilbert/seville and couldnt find one I liked. So thankful I listended to my fellow yelpers. It cost about an extra $25 than the normal groomers but so worth not leaving my poor old dog in a kennel for 5 hours like other groomers. The groomer did such a great job on the cut I signed up for auto-rescheudling!,5
8734,"Myself, husband, father, and son (9-years old) did the Empress of the Globe room on 10/30.  The employees were incredibly patient with all of my son's questions.  The room was very challenging.  The clues tied in well with one another, and we definitely needed some assistance to escape.  Yes, it was tough, but we appreciated how it made our brains work.  The props were well made, and the setup was clearly well thought out. We will be back!",5

8737,"Zen Buffet in Glendale Arizona:  Run away.  Fast.  

Am usually the kind of guy that can find the silver lining in almost any situation i.e; ""our server was a most *excellent* mouth-breather..."" - but as I write this review I still remain unable to find any redeeming quality whatsoever.  It should be known:

#1:  I'm a guy;
#2:  I'm single parent w/ kids;
#3:  I can be Stalin-esque when it comes to buffets i.e; ""quantity has a quality all its own' - which should be a godsend to ownership when rating a buffet.  My expectations are low to start.

As such, I am also very forgiving regarding buffets.  Food doesn't have to be awesome for a passing grade from my boys and I - it just can't suck.  Same thing with service:  If we're missing a place setting or salt - I'm the kind of guy who will just snag one off a neighboring table - and still tip.  Place has to reeeally go below and beside the call of duty to rate a negative (and yet I'll still tip...but that's how I roll  :-)

Zen Buffet - how much do I love thee?  I'd planned on making  list thanks to the generous 15% off Zen was offering if you mentioned ""Yelp"" - but alas, we've yet to find a thing.  What we *did* notice however is as follows:

1.  My boys and I have renamed the restaurant ""The Dancing Queen"", as this was the *only* song that played repeatedly for the 1st 44 minutes we were there.  We were having fun watching and listening to the folks around us as they would come to the same sudden realization :-p

2.  Much of the food was empty i.e; crab legs (Hey: at $12 for dinner, I'd like to have the crab legs as advertised!).  I asked the attendant  refilling the food *twice* if she would pleease refill it.  It took asking the gentleman who was seating up front to get anything crab legs - and then the other patrons were busy waiting in the wings gobbled them all up in about 90 seconds.  Never refilled again either. 

Oh HEY:  I actually *can* say something good about this place:  They refill the rice and noodles quite well!  But now back to it:

3.  One of my favorite dishes - salt & pepper shrimp - was misidentified and not available despite signage indicating otherwise.  The salt & pepper frogs legs were as advertised - just ultra weak in the spice and ultra old.  The shrimp in the bin that had the 'salt & pepper shrimp' sign was red.  And breaded.  And cold.  Health department?!?

4.  The lo mein noodles were bland and devoid of any flavour whatsoever, as were the rice noodles.  And the creepy looking fried rice (bright yellow) was so hard, bland and cold that we spat it out.  1st time.  Ever.  

5.  The wonton soup had not wontons (picked out);  no baked scallops in the 'baked scallop"" (it was chopped 'krab' that was baked in a scallop shell).

It took us that long (and $40 bucks) to realize it was time to leave.

I decided to take one quick walk back around the sushi spot.  Like before, most of it was out.  The sashimi on the far left side of the line looked like it had been cut and set out the day before yesterday.  Quite unappealing and I was actually afraid to touch it.  

Felt I owed yelp a review due to the 15%, and I really feel bad for the ownership who will in all likelihood be out of business soon.  And the summer hasn't even started.  

Looking forward to my first *real* review when I can report on a place that I actually want to go to (vs. hungry boys who spotted this place again as we were driving by today).  

Off the cuff review here, forgive the spelling/tense/general spaciness.  We're still hungry - but for something edible :-o",1
8739,"Awesome food....my group was delighted!!! Geo was polite, friendly and prompt! He delivered to my suite (which is a pain!) and made my entertaining super easy!",5
8740,"Absolute trash. Stopped by here to kill some time before connecting flight hoping to get at least a decent breakfast in the airport. I was under the impression that this place was a restaurant due to the menu's and sit down style, however I don't think they even have a stove in the back. The food was rubbery and disgusting, reminded me of what I spent a whole year dreading every morning in the freshman dining hall at my university. If I were you don't do it. Just wait until you get on the flight the food there will be better.",1
8742,"Oh my. I may never need to bake again. I can't say enough about the extreme deliciousness that awaits you at this wonderful new spot.  The raspberry croissant was to die for, as was the bacon cheddar scone. The blueberry and banana muffins were perfect in every way - moist, loaded with fresh fruit, and just sweet enough. 

I can't wait to go back.  Sweet Lorraine's is just what Dilworth needed!",5
8743,We have been to this location several times and love their ice cream.  On our most recent visit the owner gave us so many samples to try and told us he made the ice cream himself.  He was super nice and friendly and genuinely interested in the feedback about his products.  The avocado ice cream and taro ice cream were excellent.,5
8744,"O.M.G. this place is SO frackin' good. I wish they had one in LA... :( 

I've been here a couple times when I visit my sister in Vegas, and every time, I fill myself to the point where I feel like I'm dying. -__- 
I can't help it!!

The food is SO GOOD. I highly recommend the yellowtail tar tar, beef tataki, and their mushroom with butter sauce. (other foods i've tried is the grilled mackerel, tongue stew (my sister's favorite), and oyako-don. ALL are delicious. 

Last time I went my sister and I got about 7 dishes between us, and i SWEAR we practically polished the plates. The waitress came back with a look of disbelief on her face. HAHHAA. :P Anyways, I highly recommend you go here, it's very authentic and the service is SUPER friendly. :)

Only complaint would be the additional menu being ALL OVER the wall. I want to try everything, but then, there's just way too many options, and then some are written only in japanese!",5
8748,"I love Janey's. The service is always friendly and it has a great vibe. It's a great place to bring my computer and camp out for a while doing work that would be far less fun without this spot. Every time I'm in town I come here, and it makes me forget that I'm not a local.",5
8752,"First time at kneaders today! Went for breakfast and it was so good, the staff was SUPER friendly, and the service was super quick! Definitely will be going back ASAP!",5
8753,"The better choice over many places in the Strip. Excellent food and a very proficient system to order, pay for and be seated, even when there are long lines waiting to get in. Even does BYOB for a $5 charge.",5
8758,"Amazing little place with sooo much going on. This owner is doing it right. Nothing else like it in Toronto. 
Different chief /food every night. Wed. Is vegan. There is an open night mic night. New.chiefs welcome. Too many things going on to.get on this review.  Just very very different then the stuffy expensive restaurants here in Toronto.  We went on Sunday and the owner popped in and sat with us and chatted the whole time. Told us what it was all about and what an amazing guy he is. Giving back to.the community threw his place. You just have.to.check this place out. A+",5
8759,"I just saw this on Food Paradise and it is definitely on our bucket list next time we go to Vegas. I am raised in Vegas and I don't remember having this good food..... just watching it on tv, it's making me drool already.",5
8760,"Very shoddy installation! When trying to get them to fix the issues they made, you get nothing but the run - around. Very, very disappointed!!!",1
8762,"The Wynn Buffet was really good. We always used to go to the Bellagio, this was the first time we tried The Wynn and weren't disappointed. Great selection, great food and excellent service. Really pleased we headed up to the Wynn for this, highly recommended.",5
8763,"Love the food! This place is great. Even they're beans are delicious. Only thing is it is not baby friendly. The location we visited did not have a changing table in the restroom. It was also a small location. Other than that, service was great.",5
8766,"This was my first time ever at PIR and my first-ever NASCAR race as well, so I was very excited about it and my friends I went with were really happy I could go, as they'd been wanting to get me out to a race for quite some time.

I like that parking is free out there. Crazy enough that ANY kind of sporting event is usually over-priced, between food/beverages/souvenirs, so the fact that parking is free is a benefit.

We hit up the souvenir booths and got souvenir shopping done first thing. Each of the vendors were friendly, outgoing, and really having fun talking to the fans and selling items. From there, we took all our goodies back to my friend's car, locked them up, and headed back in for the day's events.

So many awesome things to do and see out there! Many different food and beverage vendors for a variety of options is great, because if you want something outside the norm of everyday food or fast food, this place definitely has it, from Loaded Baked Potatoes, to Turkey Legs. Something to consider, however, is with as big a place as PIR is, you definitely want to be wearing comfortable shoes, preferably tennis shoes, walking shoes, or some kind of sneaker. We saw a lot of females in flip-flops but we also heard a lot complaining that they should have worn actual shoes too. 

Also, being that the races are held in spring and fall, consider bringing sunscreen, especially if your seats are out in direct sunlight areas of the grandstands like ours were. Even on an overcast day, you can still come away fried like a lobster from the UV rays that come through overcast and even dark clouds. 

If you aren't used to loud noise or have never been around a racetrack before, bring earplugs in case. I lucked out and the noise didn't bother me and my sensitive ears at all. I actually ENJOYED hearing the loud, powerful engines roar by on the track!

And, one more fab tip: There's not a bad seat in the house to sit and enjoy the beautiful mountain views and the races. It's all wide open and visibility is fantastic! 

Getting in and out of PIR can be crazy if you aren't used to it, but I do recommend taking in a race and absorbing the whole experience and ambience of Phoenix International Raceway, especially on a gorgeous fall day. Take my word for it :)",5
8767,"This location at Tempe Marketplace has to be the best one yet. For starters the large amounts of parking available. The convenience of the mixture of the eye candy at midweek lunch time (ASU hot girls and business suited short skirted hot heeled women!) Oh yeah and the food!

I thought to myself what am I going to eat on my high protein diet? Mexican? Nope mexican't too much carbs, but wait my carb watching protein eating calorie counting friends. The Chipotle salad is our salvation of eating with out looking like boring dieter. 

The chicken salad bowl with no rice, beans, pico and salsa is perfect! Top it off with a little bit of lemon juice and you got a great healthy lunch and with a water you got it all for under $7. Yes my friends we can eat, healthy, cheap and good. 

For a ""fast food"" like place they have a nice open kitchen that you can see, I like that they don't hide it from you and you can see how clean it is.",5
8768,"Frozen fish patty, mystery fish perhaps.  I was expecting a batter dipped fish filet but it was more like a square of processed something that may have been fish. If you truly enjoy ""fish and chips"" just pass on this place. Had to put a star rating but it did not rate a star.",1
8769,"This company's inappropriate, deceitful, shady door-to-door sales tactics, are enough to leave a bad taste in anybody's mouth. 

We have a ""no soliciting"" sign clearly hung at our doorstep, and their salespeople have disturbed my family and I twice now. 

The first time, the salesman flat out lied about pest control being ""required by our HOA.""  The most recent time, the individual would not take no for an answer, and I was forced to close the door on him mid-sentance.

One more time, Moxie, and I'll be calling the police, filing charges for harassment and trespassing, and taking out a restraining order.

Geeze!",1
8770,"Wow, this place is great. if you want a high quality meal without paying $40 per entree in Vegas, this place is a winner. Also happy to have the Peroni on tap. Great find!",5
8775,"Alan was very attentive, kind, personable and helpful! He was even knowledgeable about my question on converting my crib/toddler bed into a full bed, in which I couldn't even find the answers online. Good customer service is hard to find but not at best mattress or with Alan. Thanks for an easy experience!",5
8776,"I moved to Madison a year ago from Austin, TX where I regularly got massages. I hadn't gotten a massage since moving, but decided it was time to treat myself for my bday. I found Susan and Why Knot via Yelp, and I have to say it was one of the best massages I've had (and I've had some really good ones!)! Susan listened to what I wanted and crafted the massage to ensure that's what I got, rather than doing the standard routine.

Given the quality and the price ($80 for 90 minutes!!), I will be making this a regular indulgence!",5
8779,"the most legitimate dining in central phoenix. classy, urban, east coast service (efficient: fill water in timely manner, strong drinks, attentive, clear plates when finished). the scallops are cooked to perfection every time so is the salmon. the filet is delicious as well. park in the back and enter through kitchen. place is bomb.",5
8781,"I came here for the first time just a few months ago and absolutely loved it so much that I bought a yearly unlimited package! What I really like about EWC is how clean it is and how awesome the staff is. Every time I go, I request Brandi because of how awesome my eyebrows always look after she's finished with them. I would recommend everyone to go see her!",5
8782,Every time I need help with a a project everyone in the store is very helpful. Great Fabrics and supplies too.,5
8783,"Holiday pricing does not equal holiday menu! NONEXISTENT king crab legs left us paying $60/person for just snow crab legs. Bellagio had king crab for 75% of the price.

There were definitely a lot less than 500 items at this buffet, unless they are counting soy sauce and other condiments as an ""item."" Buffet was a lot smaller than expected. 

The whole kiosk ticket thing makes your day revolve around the buffet. The later wait times were 400 minutes + and then you wait for another two hours to pay... And then another line to get seated...and more lines inside for food. We invested 7 hours total from start to finish.. Not worth it when you're on a time crunch or just not worth your sanity, period. Lots of people didn't even know about this ticket thing and it's not even mentioned on the website. That's very poor communication. I only knew about it because of my fellow yelpers. Heart!

Food was hit or miss. The lamb chops were very well prepared, but the cod was dryer than brawny paper towels. Some of the dishes had been sitting under the light for so long, they hardened and dried out. The deserts were disappointing, although the gelato was decent.

One time is enough.. And even that is a Rip off. I think Studio B is still one of the best value buffets. Alcohol included in the $15.99 weekday lunch buffet.",1
8784,"I went into revolution mma for a tour, seemed like these guys more interested in selling memberships than teaching mix martial arts.  They wanted $1600 for a yearly membership, the membership can not be canceled.  I asked to look at the membership contract, it looked more like a mortgage contract.  I offered to join up if i could pay on a pay as you go basis, they weren't interested.

These places try to scare people into paying.  They really can't do anything to enforce the contract.  Members can just cancel credit card or put a stop payment at the bank on cheques.",1
8785,Fernando is my new favorite server. He was happy and friendly and considering how busy it was he was not lacking in service. I love how he sung a little while he was talking to us. My favorite margarita there is the Texas Margarita. 2 of them and I am a little tipsy. I usually hate tequila. Endless Chips & salsa that are good. We got the cheese crisp this time at his recommendation which was delicious and I got the shrimp picanto (?) that was good. I would have preferred to have the tails of the shrimp already off. And would ask for it to be spicier next time.,5
8786,The girls are always so great with our kids. Very patient and do a good job on the cuts. Wait time is a little lengthy especially with kids though,5
8787,"Today I had very little time for a lunch so I ordered a sub online at my nearby Subway. When I walked in to pick up the sandwich the lady at the counter said she never got my order. I tried to show her my order confirmation I had on my phone but she immediately called her superior while ignoring me.  I asked if I could have the sandwich i ordered but she kept saying she never got the order. I had receipt of payment and a confirmation number she refused to look at. Since I was in a hurry, hence why I ordered online, I had to go! So I left five dollars poorer and no sandwich. Sadly I don't think I'll be going back to this location which is a shame since it was two minutes walking distance from my work. Still waiting for refund. I complained through the app. I'm still very hungry and have a few hours of my shift left before I'll have time to get food. :(",1
8788,"Great 24 hour spot. I love their burgers and fries. Portion sizes are generally pretty small so it's not infrequent that I get two orders. Plus it's inexpensive enough to where that's still cheaper than 1 meal at another restaurant. Great food and service, and the waitresses will remember your name the second time you go. (Especially if it's the 3rd shifters)",5
8790,Puppy town offers many pure breed at a very reasonable price. Great customer service as well.,5

8793,"I had never driven a Subaru and did not know much about their cars. When I walked into the showroom, it was under construction, but people walked up and greeted me immediately. The reason why I give them 5 stars is because of their Sales Person, Cameron. He was extremely thorough about what set Subarus apart from other cars, he was very specific about safety information, and also the features available - he was under the hood explaining how Subaru really took into consideration their owners. Cameron did all of this in the July heat. Cameron sold me on the car before I even drove it.",5
8795,"Trevor has helped me with plumbing issuesthree times now, and i will not use any other plumber. He communicates well, and is very respectful and always cleans the area up after finishing. Trevor is the first plumber i have found that i trust. His work is impeccable he treats every situation with a eye to on how he can fix the problem efficiently and with as little interuption as possible. Prior to this he replaced my hot water heater for me he repaired a gas leak and my disposal. Each time he assessed the situationthen provided me options. My most recent call to Trevor was for second floor bathroom had a leak going from my floor to ceiling downstairs. Trevor began by getting information about problem that was happening. He then assessed by removing my toilet that was wobbling. After checking plumbing he offered me 2 options to fix something at that point and be done or cut into floor to look at floor flange. He explained everything so i opted to have him replace the floor which was the smartest thing because the lead bend was cracked. Trevor is very honest reliable and i recommend him to anyone.",5
8797,"Started going to this clinic when we moved just behind it in an apt. building. Female Dr came shortly after; Dr. D Patel. Very nice, even my husband likes her and he prefers male Dr's.  and lots of experience when she came from  England. Over 15 patients in her 2000 in England that had severe handicaps so this is awesome for us. Easy to understand. Very efficient. Dr Y** was not so nice, arrogant about taking my handicapped adult daughter .. he never went through with referrals he was asked to make..at least I heard from no one.. ..  so we changed when the lady Dr. came.. no problems now..  front desk girls are very nice and good also. Only problem was Y**'s attitude but we don't see him only Dr. D. Patel now. . not long waits either. Excellent Dr. and very down to earth.",5

8802,Updating my review - they have stepped up their service by hiring a lot more servers and their food comes out fresh and fast. It's always busy here now and I'm happy they've improved everything. My favourite sushi restaurant in Durham.,5

8805,"I didn't quite realize how much I love Thai Cuisine until they closed for a few months to remodel. Their absence was deeply felt. Now that they are back in action, the restaurant is better than ever! It is now fully handicapped accessible, with a bright clean new dining room and multiple bathroom stalls. I was worried that the prices may increase due to the remodel, but no, they are the same. The food, also same, if not improved. The Tom Kha soup is as awesome as can be and our entrees were perfectly delicious. They still feature a separate vegetarian menu to make ordering easy. Most anything on the vegetarian menu is or can be vegan (just ask about egg - veg items do not contain fish sauce or shrimp paste). And the service has always been excellent.",5
8806,My dog and I had a wonderful experience here! Beautiful grooming and wonderful people! I highly recommend this place.,5
8807,"We had a resvervation for a big party. They made my friend sign a contract with credit card information to ensure the number of attendants and time of arrival. We booked for 8:30pm, arrived 15 min early, but didn't have a table until 9:30pm. They made us We waited for more than an hour and all of us were starving. It was ridiculous that they asked us to arrive on time and they did not even have a table. What is the point of making reservation?

Food is so so - pineapple was good and juicy, but steaks were very salty and burnt. In-house service is HORRIBLE though. The servers were slamming meat on my salad WITHOUT even asking if I want it or not (PS: I had my card thingy on table showing red - meaning slow down, no more food please - apparently servers don't care). One of them even dropped pineapple on my napkin and ran away.

Half-way through our dinner, servers were cleaning up our table and asking if they can take the plates away. One of them took my plate away and never replace a new one to me. I had to go get a new plate at the salad bar myself. And then I realized why they kept asking us if we are done or not... because there were no more meat coming!! I didn't eat alot but I felt so bad for 
customers who came after us because their only food is the salad bar.

This is so far the WORST restaurant experience I had in 2015. I had been to the same chain in Niagara Falls. They had less meat selection, but service was not as bad. I am 100% sure I will not come back to this location ever again, and will recommend small/big parties not to hold events here  (unless you want all your guests stuck at the entrance for over an hour and go home with empty stomachs).",1
8809,"D'andre Jackson our car salesman was excellent in his customer service as well as Matt who helped us in finance. These guys really helped me out a lot after being in a terrible car accident that put me in a stressful situation without a vehicle. They did everything they could to help me get the best possible deal even though I had a couple credit issues. These guys were very personable and definitely will have my family's business in the future. I couldn't have asked for a better process, they were up front and communicated very well. Thank you guys.",5
8810,"Excellent meal! My favorite new Asian place- and I grew up in Singapore. Try the Edamame gyoza for a nice twist on  an old favorite. The curry laksa was delicious and so was the tuna tataki! Soo was so friendly and helpful- five stars. Lexi, our server was right on point",5
8814,This place is amazing. The food is so good and it's very low priced. The service at this location is also exceptionally good! My family comes here all the time and have been for years. This will probably always be our favorite pizza place! Love it!,5
8816,"Only ever been here for lunch... wish I could get out for a happy hour. 

The Sushi is great, and the atmosphere is even better. I try to order 1 different roll with every visit - so I can go through them all. I have never been disappointed with any of them so far. Caterpiller Roll, Lollipop Roll, and Samba Roll are my favorites so far. 

If you are into eye candy - this is the place to hang. Make sure to get a good seat with a ""view"". Only downside - tend to see allot of the 50+ with 25 and under types - and they are being a little to friendly to be father daughter. But hey - its Scottsdale!

As for drinks - only ever had 1 - Fallen Samurai... which is their version of a spicy bloody mary. WOW -- it was good. 

I will be back - only wish I could go more often.",5
8820,"Love this place for all the little things that I have tried! Their iced coffee is so refreshing in summer and their bakery and pastry are out of the world! Maybe a bit pricey but I think it's worth it. Seriously, I need to go back there soon!",5
8822,First time in at WCG and we absolutely loved it!! Ashley our waitress was very attentive and gave us great service.  That combined with a great dinner just made our night. Bbq trio was spectacular and great ambiance. Finally she recommended the white chocolate brownie wich sealed the deal. We will definitely be back.,5
8823,"Chocolate. Yum. Free samples of delicious chocolate? DOUBLE YUM. 

AND A FREE TRUFFLE FOR CHECKING IN ON YELP? Like oh my gosh, everyone put your hands up! and say yeaahh :) 

Opted for the Himalayan pink sea salt and goji berries milk chocolate bar. Omgosh my mom and I are officially addicted to that bar. Tried the funk and disco truffle - it tastes like banana pudding in milk chocolate. Yummy!

8826,Great Korean bbq spot . The restaurant was very clean. The service was great . There were 3 of us and we went at the end of a night on a Sunday so they close earlier on Sunday's . The service was still great even though we were the last people in the restaurant . We got the beef and pork platter. The beef was top notch quality and was mouth watering good . The pork was great too . All of the sides were good . The pickled radish being my favorite . Everything about this place is great and it's a great value too . The 3 of us were plenty full and satisfied and for only 120 all in with gratuity . I will be back soon.,5
8829,"I have eaten seafood all over the world, and generally the best is south of I-10 in Louisiana and Mississippi.  However, the Wildfish Grill was wonderful.  The crab-fried rice was almost indescribable.  The swordfish was great!  Salads, sides, everything was top-shelf.  But the thing that took Wildfish from 4.5 stars to 5 stars was the Pineapple Upside Down Cake.  Good grief!  My mom would be jealous!",5

8831,"This is my first visit to Sultans Grill and it was amazing.  Steve the owner is a really nice guy who runs an amazing business.  I ordered the chicken strips, something my daughter and I really wanted and let me tell you; first off they are made fresh to order and when they came to the table i was shocked.

This was a real chicken (not processed, not bought from a supply place, but a real chicken breaded and sliced into strips and cooked to perfection.  I have never had chicken strips prepared from scratch in any place.

So how were they, AMAZING....this place is located in a small indoor food court across from the court house and if you ever get the chance to head down to Lewis and 2nd street, you need to visit this place.

They have an great looking menu and from people who have been here many times, this is one of the last places you would expect to find food of this caliber, but I am here to tell you what, this is the first place I will go when I am looking for a good meal during the week.

Most people will say downtown???  It takes nothing to get downtown and this place is worth the trip.  I will be back often as the menu has a great selection of items I am wanting to try.  I added a picture of the chicken and fries so you can see the amazing chicken strips.",5
8832,One of my favorite spots in the city.  The whole experience is handled with enthusiasm and confidence.  And why not?  When you're putting out marinated love you should be proud.  Now if they only delivered.,5
8834,"It's a little hidden, so people seem to not notice it as well, so there was absolutely NO WAIT! It's a little bit of a hike up the many stairs, or you could use the elevator if you need (or are lazy). Service was quick, our glasses were never empty, and the food was fast and delicious. Our experience couldn't have been better.",5
8835,"Negative 5 stars!!!  Service is the absolute WORST here (when you aren't Korean, if your are Korean then you get your meats to the table fast and service is obviously better)!!!  I expect no service from Asian restaurant, I'm used to that.  But this place is down right ri-DIC-ulous!  I always leave here mad and pissed off because the servers aggravated me.  

-You order your meats in the 1st round and they try to tell you it's too much. And won't take anymore orders.  Even when it's a party of 8.

-They come by and grab the meat off the grill and just distribute it to whoever at the table even when its not even cooked yet.  Then they grab a used napkin from anyone sitting close by and scrapped the black gunk from the grill.  WT!?

-asking for anything it's like pulling teeth!!. We asked 3 separate servers for hot tea, finally got it after about half and hour. 

-they limit you two pieces of kalbi per person, which is fine.  But argues with you that you reached your limit and it suddenly changes to one per person when the menu states two pieces per person!  I'm not going to cheat you out of an extra piece of kalbi people...relax!  

Only thing I like about this place is that it's 24 hours.  The service and the aggregation I get here is not worth it!  I rather starve!  I seriously want to fight somebody when I dine here. (haha...poor service is one thing, but they seriously piss you off here.)  

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED...don't make me say I told you so.",1
8837,"To start off I must confess, I am a VERY difficult patient at the dentist office. My anxiety level just at the thought of going is through the roof. However, the staff there was so extremely patient and showed that they truly cared and understood my anxiety. 
I was able to get in as a new patient within a day or two and Dr. Ngo did not just diagnose the problem and tell me to set another appointment (which is what a lot of dental offices would've done), he diagnosed the problem and took the time to fix it right then. 
Jan ROCKED :)  She completely understood my feelings and did everything humanly possibly to make things go smoothly for me. Dr. Ngo was so patient and understanding, explaining ever step of the way what he was doing and that he understood how difficult this was for me.
I'm not saying I will not be as anxious when I go back but at least I know that they will understand and do whatever is needed to make me as comfortable as possible.",5
8838,"I can appreciate how difficult it must be to create a menu but this place needs to work a little harder. Went here with 9 others and only 2 of the entrees and one side was average or above. The other 7 entrees and multiple sides didn't get finished. Too many other, better places in Vegas. Don't waste your time on this, hoping you pick one of the acceptable meals. They get one star for effort, and that's being generous.",1

8845,"We have given this place a few tries. Nice from the outside, cheap diner from the inside. The hostess was sloppy and disheveled. The waitress was awesome, but the food was barely edible. I would not recommend this establishment at all. Go down to Maxwells about a half mile east.",1
8846,"Service is civilized but not attentive. Food is definitely on the pricey side and is not warranted considering the fact that the food is not all that good.

There are better choices.",1

The four of us were able to eat enough sushi we couldn't eat any more, along with sake and beers, and the total bill was only $70.  An absolute steal! Especially because the delicious dinner was sealed with a complimentary dessert: fresh fruit and chocolate!

Grabbed drinks and a brownie at Earl of Sandwich, too! They were super nice and helpful!",5
8867,"Wow, awful!

I've never had such a bad dry cleaning experience. I had a pretty straightforward job -- a suit -- and it was returned with a bunch of lint and a lot of the edges roughly handled. I spent an hour smoothing things back into shape. When I called to complain, they were rude and indifferent.  
Right Touch Dry Cleaners is a drive and out of the way but far worth it.",1
8869,"I found Trudy through her Instagram and was amazed by all the perfected eyebrows in the vast amount of real life before and after pictures there.  Despite her hefty price, I contacted her in March 2016 and got myself appointment two months later.  It took so long for her to reply back to me but when the time came to her taking my deposit that was not the case.  That should have been the first red flag with her lack of communication but I still insisted to overlook that because I was so convinced from her Instagram pictures.

I finally met her and got my eyebrows done.  She appeared nice but nonchalant.  I made sure I gave myself ample amount of time to show up ahead of time to not be late since her fine print emphasized on one's implications should one arrive late.  The process was very straight forward and I was excited as heck to finally get eyebrows.  My eyebrows didn't turn out completely the way that I had expected but Trudy emphasized that the results are very individualized and vary depending on the natural shape of my brows, fine, I respected that.

What really upset me is how unprofessional she is and the lack of a flying care for her customers AFTER she gets your money.  I emailed her on June to secure my first touch-up appointment and she gave me her ""the next earliest available date is September"", and I gladly confirmed.  I was on maternity leave while all this was happening and I returned back to work and had a conflict with the date.  I emailed her immediately to request for a change in appointment date.  She finally emailed me back saying that the next earliest appointment that she had was in September which pushes pass the 6 month point for touch-up appointments and that it would cost me an additional $200 fee.

I really wished that Trudy treated her customers like real life humans instead of being so fixated on her advantageous rules to squeeze whatever she can out of the clients.  This really upset me that she showed no flexibility or accommodation to work together with her customers to foster the long term relationships.  I told her to cancel my appointment altogether as I rather lose my eyebrows than to ever give her another dollar of my money.  

I followed her aftercare instructions exactly and my eyebrows faded and empty patches as can be seen in her pictures.  I would highly recommend that readers to consider looking at my uploaded pictures of the harsh reality that not everyone's eyebrows would turn out beautiful as only shown on her IG account, such as in my case that can be seen in my uploaded photos.  Save yourself the trouble and take your business to somebody else that would have more respect and care for their customers because Trudy doesn't care beyond money.",1
8872,"Great service! I called at 7:30am and he was here within two hours. While the job wasn't super difficult or an emergency- it was something I needed completed with my husband out of town and a leaking/broken toilet valve.

8873,"I was excited about moving in the complex looked so great I signed a 3-month lease. There was a $200 dollar error on the move-in statement gave me to sign and write a check. If I had not have caught it no one would have. 
I soon realized what a nightmare this would be. The floor system/construction is so poorly insulated that the guy above me footsteps sounded like godzillla and when ever it left the apartment his dog would bark non-stop for hours. I complained to management but they would not do anything about it except ask the tenant to try and do something. Nothing ever stopped it after few more complaints. My balcony was very close to the pool on the 3rd floor, anytime my balcony door was open and someone went through one of the two gates, bammmm! Had to keep the door closed on nice days. The internet service which is cox was a bad joke to set up and never worked that well.
When I moved out and recieved my deposit check I went to the bank but it had troulbe cshing the check, I had to stand at the teller window for 20 minutes while the bank had to verify the check by phone, the bank want too happy nor was I. They said the company isn't following standard protocol. Be warned about this place, not sure I believe all the glowing reviews. I heard from other residents how noisy the night life/restaurants is late on the sides of the building that are nearer  to them than mine was.
The other issue is there is a heliport right across the street so there are several loud helicopters taking off daily. The pool is surrounded on 3 sides by 5 stories, very little sunshine.  Don't rent there, I would have cancelled my lease but to expensive to do so, the day i was moving in I talked to a lady in the elevator moving out after only 3 days. I thought uh oh!",1
8874,"The reputation and integrity of the company is a reflection of the people who own, operate, and work for that company. My wife and I just had our roof replaced by Legacy roofing. These folks are amazing. On August 5th we called Legacy for an estimate on a leak repair and possible roof replacement. Toby, the owner met with us the very same day. He offered us a choice between the two. Our roof was 25 years old so we decided to replace it. That evening Nancy sent our quote via email, and the following day Toby's brother Mike brought us some samples to look at. By weeks end we had our order in for our new roof. Tear off on the old roof was completed on Monday August 10th and our new roof was completed on Tuesday August 11th, a day earlier than anticipated. The tear-off crew was courteous, professional, and thorough. Roof was dried in, stocked with material, and cleaned up in the same afternoon. Dan and his crew arrived the next morning for shingles. Despite the monsoon rain off and on all day they finished that afternoon. The folks at Legacy said what they were going to do, and delivered with flying colors. I would recommend legacy to anyone looking for an honest roofing company for any roofing needs. Thank you so much for a job well done. We love our new roof!!

8880,"Hubby and I just got back from Vegas and we always stay at Caesar's Palace.  For some reason, we had not tried Rao's so I made sure we checked it out this trip.  It was one of the best Italian resturats I have been to.  It wasn't super busy when we got there, so the staff was pretty attentive.  I asked to have a table in the replica room when I originally made the reservations.  It was awesome!  I loved the old style look.  It was a little dark, but we used our phone flashlights when we needed to. 

We started off with the Mozzarella Carrozza.  They were like two giant fried cheese triangles.  They were perfectly breaded and the mozzarella was rich and creamy.  The marinara sauce was pretty tasty too - very fresh and flavorful.

For our entrees, hubby had the Veal Parm and I had the Penne Vodka w/Meatballs on the side.  Seriously, the veal was HUGE!!  And bone in!!!  It was so tender that hubby was cutting it with his fork.  The penne was cooked to a perfect al dente and the vodka sauce was heavanly.  I have become a big fan of Vodka sauce, so I've had it in a few resturants and this has to be one of the best, if not the best.  I thought it was pretty cool the way they presented it.  The waiter came to the table and plated it from the pan that it was cooking in.  The real star of the evening was the meatballs.  They melted in your mouth like butter.  We were actually taking slices off of them with our forks.  We were so stuffed, but I felt horrible having so much left over, so we over ate...again.  We didn't finish them, but couldn't take them with us, it was really a damn shame.  

No room for dessert this time, which is shocking since I LOVE sweets.  I think next time we'll scale it back so we can try the cheesecake.  Hubby was very grateful that I set this up for us.  We will definately return.  Cheers!",5

8884,"This place use to have 5 stars and now it can't even deserve one star. Let me star by saying if you go out to eat at a restaurant you expect for everyone to get there food at the same time so you can eat together as a family, not so you have to eat while someone in your party waits to get there food while everyone else eats cause at this point we are starving after waiting an hr for our food !!!!!! Keep in mind 2 adults and 3 children. So my husband order steak and shrimp, as soon as he gets his plate put down first thing he see is a big black hair in the mash potatoes. We show the server the hair she grabs it say I'll be rite back, she walked toward her manager and the manager then takes the plate goes to the back doesn't come back till about 3 mins to tell us don't worry I took care of it I'm making you a new one. Walks away does not say sorry does not ask if we need anything. At this point me and my husband are so fed up with the rudeness and the way they attend this situation. It's hair not nice to have on your food in a restaurant. Ten minutes pass and the steak is still not out at this point we want nothing and just want to leave are bill was $80 you tell me where the she took care of it part was ? Ridiculous Olive Garden had done way better job with managers apologies and come to the table rite away and talk to us and make you feel better . Not this place I will never come here even if the have my favorite soup. So upset of how they handle their situations like this and the manger should most defiantly not have this position .",1

I ALSO had the best corndogs (or pogos as they call them here) I've ever eaten, with a house-made batter that's simply to die for and a seasoned mayo or ketchup for dipping (both are good).

Alex explained in detail what he could do to make the installation look clean. I made an appointment a couple of days later. I dropped off the car and picked it up later in the afternoon. As expected, they did a great job and the installation looks great. Although I live on the east side of town, the drive was worth it. Great price and great service. I highly recommend 305 Kustoms!

Firestone went through my car with a fine tooth comb. They identified the root cause of the issue and took ownership.

==========
I've been going to this location for several years. They have always been professional, timely and reasonably priced, but my latest visit was a disappointing and surprising disaster. 

I went in for an oil change, and there was something wrong with the brakes. The brakes were a surprise because the same location serviced them less than a year prior. They showed me the new issue - the calipers had gone bad. They fixed the new problem and replaced the parts from the previous service for free. I was a happy customer... until I picked up my car. 

As soon as I turned the key, I knew something was off. The engine did not sound or feel right (subtle but noticeable). The car was sluggish during acceleration. Still, it ran without significant issues so I took it home.

Two days later I took my family on a road trip. We were headed up a steep incline and all of a sudden we lost power and white smoke exploded out of our tailpipe.

I took the car back, explained the observations when I picked the car up and the performance during the road trip. They were closing in 45 minutes so the manager said they'd look at it and have an answer the next morning.

The next morning came with an $1,100 estimate to fix the car. The manager, under the impression that only the brakes were repaired, maintained that their service had nothing to do with the issues causing the performance and behavior I observed after I picked it up.

I disagree.

If my car worked (except for the brakes) before I dropped it off, you work on it for two days, and there's a problem when I pick it up - you caused the problem.

I'm waiting on a response from their Corporate Office. I hope they choose to take ownership of this.",5

He ambiance reminds me of an old school barber shop with a modern flare. 
The staff are friendly and attentive. I was given a bottle of water while waiting for my turn at the chair. 
I got my haircut from Elliot, the man himself. He took the time to listen to what I wanted and executed well. He is clearly a perfectionist as he took about an hour on my hair (I don't mind as long as the outcome is in my favor). 
He even used a hot towel on my head prior to doing my straight razor fade. 

Given the time and effort he expended on my hair, he earned a good tip and a repeat customer. I'm definitely coming back for another 'cut with Elliot.",5

8919,"Entrance to the park is FREE!!!


South Mountain park is the largest city run park in the United States. Drive down Central Avenue and take the roads all the way to the top of the mountain at Dobbins point, Buena Vista look out and TV towers. It's free to get in and the gates to get in close at 7 PM but you do not have to leave the park until 11 PM. The road up and around the top of the mountain is a sports car/motorcycles dream (or nightmare if you go over the cliffs).

Fantastic mountain for hiking during the day or night time hikes with city views. Granted this mountain is not as private and desolate as the superstitions but it is 10 times better than hiking Camelback with 350 other people on the same trail.  I have hiked all day for 15 miles and never ran into a soul all day (which is what I want when hiking).

Multiple access points to the mountain are located all around the perimeter. 

During the spring south mountain has a spectacular array of desert wildflowers blooming on it... Get out and take some lovely pictures!",5

8940,"Working with Orlando and Best In Show has been one of the best things I could have done for my 1 year old Doberman, Gesiah. I found that Gesiah would be walking me down the street and basically do whatever he wanted when he wanted. I did my best trying to do my own obedience training by watching ""It's me or the Dog"" and the ""Dog Whisperer"" but I was not get consistent results like I wanted. I found that playing fetch, calling him to come when I wanted him, eating his food with having to dress it up, and going to the bathroom all over the yard was a battle. After putting in a phone call to Orlando at Best in Show, he invited me to a few of his sessions. I noticed that when I asked Gesiah to do a command he would only do it if there was a treat involved or sometimes he would do nothing because he was out of his environment. My goal was for him to be obedient on my terms not his. I finally decided to leave Gesiah with Orlando in his home for 2 1/2 weeks. Orlando welcomed me to visit Gesiah at anytime and to also see the progress that they had made. After the 2 1/2 weeks with Orlando, Gesiah walks by my side, listens to my commands, eats his food and has good manners. Thanks to Orlando and the techniques he taught me, his level of expertise enhanced my understanding and competency in working with my dog on his weaknesses as well as my own weaknesses as the pack leader. I am very pleased with Orlando's training methods and have witnessed an impressive change in my dog's behavior and attitude. I strongly recommend Orlando's services for both dog owner novices as well as those of you who consider yourselves fairly knowledgeable and competent. There's always room to grow, and Orlando's experience can help you do just that. The Investment was well worth it and your services were greatly appreciated. Thank you Orlando!!!!!!!! 

With warm regards, 
Sandra and the new and improved Gesiah 

Update 3/09/14:   Gesiah is almost 6 years old and has maintained all of the training he was taught by Orlando. Anytime i walk into a Petsmart or a dog park, I'm always complimented on his behavior and how well he listens. Even at home he does great when i get company at the door or when we go on walks. Orlando has been a blessing. He has taught me so much but at the end of the day it's about having a dog who listens well and behaves. Gesiah is very loving and gentle but most importantly he continues to be obedient. Once again Thank you Orlando aka Best in Show for doing such an amazing job!!!",5

8945,"I came here a while ago and I was browsing for places on yelp for my next Vegas trip so I thought I'd write a review about my experience while I was looking. 

First off, I got sick eating here. That should be a red flag to people considering the place, but it honestly could have what I ordered. Wanting to be cheap I got the roast beef sandwich. The sandwich was served cold which was fine with me. But it tasted very strongly of horseradish to the point where the store bought roast beef and veggies were sort of overpowered. That was also fine. I thought it'd at least make the sandwich taste like SOMETHING, but not to long into my meal and I felt a strange gagging reflex and a rumbling in my tummy. The meat seemed to have gone bad and it was very well masked by the aforementioned horseradish. I spent the night with an upset stomach and a bit of heaving.

Just do yourself a favor when you're in Vegas and choose your dining establishment with at least as much care as you would place on a table game.",1

I went here on a weeknight when it was relatively empty, with a few men on business who probably didn't have to pay.

The decor feels authentic but quite dated, with the female servers wearing kimonos.

I ordered the salmon dinner for $29, which I thought would at least be a bento box at this price.  Wrong.  It came with an average miso soup and salad,  rice, and a small piece of salmon which I could have made myself.

Maybe if you're on business, you can afford to try one of every dish, but I don't think this restaurant deserves a second chance.",1

I went in and tried a couple of samples - sample cups were on the counter by the frozen yogurt and I just grabbed a couple of the small cups to try 1-2 flavors. I wanted something fruity and something more creamy so I went with dulce de leche and pomegranate raspberry. O M G The dulce the leche did not disappoint! It was so delicious that I hope it sticks around for a while so I can keep going back and getting it. Topping-wise, they have a great variety of toppings with different fruits, chocolates (including kit kats which I love!), chocolate chips, nuts, and sauces. I will definitely be going back to try more of the flavors in the future!",5
8960,"This has to be the worst customer service I have ever had.  I had a recall on my airbag, called 4 times and left messages and never got a return call.  My wife called 2 more time and finally demanded to speak to someone.  She was able to get the appt for the recall.  Later that week we realized we needed our state inspection.  I called to add that to my appt and she said no problem and that it was added to the appt.  The next week my wife takes the car to the appt and on her way the check engine light comes on.  She gets there and they said that we didn't have an appt for a state inspection, but they would try to squeeze it in.  She was then told that we couldn't do a state inspection because of the check engine light(which we understand) she then asked for them to figure out why it came on and fix it while we are here so we can do state inspection.  They did a diagnostic test($130ish) but was told we would pay if they found something to fix.  Of course they didn't find anything that needed fix and just reprogrammed the computer system and told us to drive 100 miles before inspection.  Wouldn't you know it the next week the light comes back on and we take it back in.  Now this time they find an issue to fix, but won't send it to our warranty company because they don't deal with them anymore( they submitted to them last year when we had an issue) they didn't feel the need to tell is this time.  They also would not refund our diagnostic fee from last visit like they said they would.  When my wife called to talk to the manager to discuss the situation he told her he wasted 10 minutes of his time listening to her berate him.  He said he would talk to the service desk in the am to see what they discussed and call her back in the am.  Surprise surprise, no call the next day. Then two days later she gets a text about a survey and that they strive for all 10's... as a customer we would at least like a call back",1
8961,This has become my standard for all sushi to be judged. I have not had a bad item here. Rainbow carpaccio is a must try. Its sashimi of 4 or 5 different fish with a cucumber relish. Prices are moderate but with a free BYOB its easy to overlook that. The tempura is light and prefectly crisp. I've only had one noodle dish I think. So I cant judge too well based on that. But what I had was excellent. Service is always great.,5
8962,"As someone who works for local Espresso bar I really wanted to like this place. But my experiences there are crappy enough that I will never return. First off there is no rhyme or reason of where to order. No sign, line or anything just a random girl standing on her phone, completely Ignoring your presence. If you try to walk to the opposite side of the bar where the menu actually is you can count on the male Barista questioning you as if you've offended them. Oh and be sure not to ask about the blends or beans they will give you entilted replies as if youre stupid. As someone who sincerely loves everything coffee culture I was hoping for some solidarity, welcoming spirit or atleast fast or friendly service which ALL three times I got none of. Plus the wait time is absurd bc it's never that busy. Unless you want a place to sit on your laptop allday and drink average coffee alone this place should be avoided. I wish they had manager present for customers to talk to instead of having bad service repeatedly.",1
8963,"Perfect lunch. Three awesome tacos, one awesome chilaquiles, two great salsas, a nice basket of chips, two iced teas, a flan and a key lime pie and we are in heaven.

Eat here!",5
8964,"I called to get a quote for a large order and was told to expect a call back but it never happened. I called back to put a final order in but upon my arrival I realize they did not give the right items. I had tried to confirm the order over the phone. I was in too much of a rush to check and only realized upon arriving home. With several phone calls I had expected the order to be not so disastrous at pickup. Horrible customer service and very unorganized. Machines were also down so I had to run off to get cash for a huge order. For a prime Saturday night that's disappointing.

$18 for a ridiculous small portion of rib tips was also, ridiculous...",1

We called at 840, almost feeling guilty due to them closing at 9....just because we wanted garlic knots delivered to our house. 1 small order of 6 garlic knots...and guess who didn't deny us?

8970,Been coming to gangnam for a few months now. Have had a great experience every time so I thought id leave a review. The meats are amazing and the vegetables are tasty too. It doesn't take a lot of money to get filled up so don't worry that's its not a all you can eat restaurant. My favorite is mixing the white rice with the egg custard and putting a little kimchi on top before I add my meat on yop. Also don't forget to check in so you get your free ice cream. The best flavor is vanilla. Trust me,5
8976,"What can I say... this is simply the best beer that you're ever going to taste!  I'm a huge fan of local breweries and Draai Laag is first in class.  This Pittsburgh Gem is a great spot to meet on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.  The staff is knowledgable, friendly and you never wait for a beer!  And once you taste Draai Laag beers, you'll understand why it's hard to wait for your next draft.  My personal favorites are Simon Girty and Goedenact-- the gifts that keep on giving!!  Kudos to the genius behind these recipes-- modern day Einstein when it comes to making beer!  Thank you for your contribution to delicious brew my friend.  Cheers to all!",5
8980,"This is my favorite French Bistro in the country. Great service, especially at the bar and the food is delicious. My favorite is the salad when I'm eating clean, and when I'm not, the frites are to die for and the chocolate souffl√© is so decadent. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed.",5
8983,Great place to have breakfast! You have to get country chicken with eggs!!!!  :-) Delicious!,5
8987,"Mediocre food and to add insult to injury the ""included"" toppings consist of onions, cilantro,cucumber and carrots. Everything else is a premium...no thank you.",1
8988,"Great table side Korean BBQ. It is a buffet so you can sample a range of proteins to cook at table. There is also a number of cooked items but the best is the BBQ cooked table side. 
Also a nice selection of soups you can try. The kimchi soup is great. 
Speaking of kimchi it is made fresh and it shows. There is a red kimchi that is a medium heat and a white if you you do not like spicy food. But do try it. 

I will come here again on my next trip to LV.",5
8989,I really wish I would have looked at these reviews before choosing to rent with Franklin west. Please take all of these negative reviews seriously because they are valid. They really do try to impress you when looking at the properties and they do have nice properties. As soon as you're in a lease the courtesy ends. They do everything they can to charge you extra fees. The management is horrible and never understanding. I know what a process apartment hunting can be but please look elsewhere.,1
8992,"Little Cleo's - another spot that has been hovering on my foodie bucket list.  Since my heart actually does belong to Bean Town, I am a bit of a seafood snob. We were dining with another couple, one of which was another native Bostonian and bonafide seafood expert. Our collective love of most anything from the Ocean lead us to Little Cleo's.  We were celebrating and wanted to ensure we could get seated so we opted for a last minute reservation. I was skeptical that we would be able to secure a spot so last minute, no problem there! The table we were led to was tucked away in the back of the restaurant making it cozy and as secluded as possible for this busy little gem of a place.

Staff: So incredibly nice, friendly, smiling, looked genuinely happy to be interacting with us. In addition to food, I am also passionate about fashion.  The young woman who greeted and seated us was wearing a bright summer fruit printed dress that made me smile, a nice change from uniform restaurant garb.  Our server was awesome!  She new the menu intimately and helped us all weigh our choices in a practical informed fashion.

Ambiance: Love the open concept and blending of venues, i had plenty to look at but not in an overstimulating way. Maybe a decibel too loud yet since we were in a corner it helped keep sounds muted enough where we could have an audible conversation.

Food:  Definitely above average for this seafood lover, again I have been spoiled by some of the best seafood in the Nation, AZ not really on the leader board in this category.  The ""toast"" was a hit especially when dipped in the butter from the crab legs jar - decadent, artery clogging, gut busting but worth it!  Friend in a posted picture had the oysters and octopus as well as the shrimp poor boy, he raved about all three. Fish and Chips - worth the bath in hot oil necessary for this staple!  I had the crab legs in a jar - warm and succulent crab, yummy, yum, yum! The last dish to review was a disappointment - cajun shrimp with corn and potatoes.  Shrimp were rock hard like the first time I boiled shrimp without instruction. The cajun spice was good but not great.

Bummer: They were out of lemon icebox cake I was saving room for.  

Prices: Well it is seafood after all...fish don't swim in the dessert.",5
8993,"My gf stayed in the Augustus Tower, 32nd floor in room 3295 during Sema week 2017. Perfect quiet room away from the elevator with a spa tub as requested. Got my mandatory bubble bath. The room was spacious with a king bed and seating area. Bathroom was huge with dual vanity, private toilet (with a separate door inside the bathroom), and a glass enclosed shower. Loved that there was a security camera right outside of the room. View was not that great but it didn't matter as we were not in the room much. Plus side is it's left of lobby and you pass Starbucks going to and from the elevators. Self check in was a breeze. Augustus tower rooms are definitely nicer and more spacious than the Julius rooms which are more basic. I stayed in a Julius room with coworkers before she arrived and it was not as nice but still more than sufficient. No tub though, only a shower.",5
8995,"You can always judge a place by how busy it is. If you're reading a review from someone saying "" I don't know what all the hype is about"". Well, if there were any truth to that, then the place would not be packed full of customers almost from opening to closing time.

I have tried a lot of different food items here. I can say that almost everything was much better than average. My favourites are the apple fritters and huge cold cut sandwiches. Custom ordered sfogliatelle cake is the best in Toronto. And if you don't know what this is...I suggest you order one. It is pronounced 
 (sfoya tella)

Yes some days you may get a food item that wasn't as good as the last time. This is based on a constellation of factors.  But then you go back again, and it was better then the first time.

I am Italian and I have been to almost every Italian bakery in Toronto.  My opinion by far that this bakery is the best.

And whomever compared their donuts to Tim Hortons must have lost their sense of smell and taste.  People don't line up and take numbers to buy Tim Hortons donuts.  One day I was placing an order and three different customers kept interrupting asking if there were any apple fritters left.",5
8998,"After walking around the Mirage looking for some food, this restaurant looked pleasant enough. We sat down, were choosing our meal, to discover a German COCKROACH crawling upon our menu. Is the food unclean? Bug infestation? Call me petty but I refuse to eat at a place that supply's bugs as their main course.",1
9003,"We visited here after the Monona Terrace tour.  It was crazy busy because of the Taste of Madison over Labor Day weekend.  Btw, the Taste of Madison totally sold me over the Mn State Fair which cost $13 plus food which is supersized.  At the Taste of Madison, no admission fee and everything is $5 and under.  Totally affordable without all the guilt of eating a bunch of junk food since everything is smaller portion.  Well back to the capitol, the free tour was decent considering the guide had a group of over 20 people.  We visited several room which were all fantastic.  Also, we missed the observatory deck because it was closing time.  Overall, everything was fantastic with the architecture and the arches/stairways.",5
9006,"Great place , highly recommend for either a fun date or for a family gathering. Family size portions. It's just like a typical Italian dining room themed.

9010,Just got the worst haircut in my 49 years on planet Earth. This includes the ones my Mom gave me when I was a kid. The girl that attempted to cut my hair had no idea what she was doing. She took about 20 snips at my hair ( about 3 minutes) spun me around and asked me how I liked it. What a joke. Trust me on this. Do not go any where near this place.,1
9011,"Great Liquor Store!  The employees are super helpful and friendly.  These guys just reopened and the selection of products continue to increase.  They offer a delivery service which is cheaper than a DUI-I think it is a $5 minimum.  I absolutely love this Liquor Store-screw the big chains and buy from the smaller business owners.  Oh, and there is sometimes a ""smoking hot"" brunette hanging out inside!",5
9012,"Had lunch here and it was delicious. Had the sea bass(awesome), and two sushi rolls (both delicious). Also, there was some mixup and the table next to us ended getting some of our stuff, they gave us one of our dishes for free, brought out another dish (scallops) on the house and gave us dessert as well.

9016,They have great customer service.  There was an issue with my valentine's day flowers and they handled it exactly the right way.,5
9017,"Love this place! The different flavors and their great customer service makes this place worthy of 5 stars. When you walk in the store you are immediately greeted by staff even when they are busy tending to other customers. They let you try samples so you are able to choose which flavor you like which sometimes is not a good thing because then I just want to get everything! My favorite to get is pistachio - I know, I know, such a simple flavor but I have tried pistachio in other gelato places here in LV and Gelatology have the best one. Also, if you love coffee and gelato try ordering their affogato - it's soooo good. 

They serve different and unique gelato flavors daily so it's good to follow their instagram to see what flavors they have available. They also serve vegan, gluten and lactose free gelatos so there's something for everyone!",5

9022,"The place looks nice, ambience is good but the staff and food is worse. We ordered some food and a mango lassi,  totalled upto some $87 which already had an additional surcharge.

So here is where they are bad: The mango lassi was just mango puree with water, when I said that this doesn't taste like make lassi, just after a sip as there was no yogurt in it and it was very thin in consistency I was given a lecture n argument that this how its been made for 16 years. So I told them to please take it back as I dont like it n they did (looking at me in rage). Then they brought us the food, which first of all is like not worth the money coz there is no justifiable quality or quantity. Plus to take revenge the staff added so much red chilli powder on top that we had stomach burns right from the very first bite, so requested them to change it n they said it will still be charged n to taunt us one of thier other servers kept commenting I hope you are enjoying the food (when u can taste the difference that whether the food is cooked with or has chilli powder added just on top) 

Its not at all good for Indian people as you would straight away know how they are fooling people.

Will never go back there even if I was given free food.",1
9024,"The service is pleasant - Just right. 
The Mocha is smooth, elegant and balanced. 
And to top it off you can sit inside a beautifully set coffee shop. Lots of space to get work done or to catch up with friends. Or if you prefer the outdoors there is space for that as well. 

Give it a shot it might be the space you are looking for.",5

Molly has been on time for virtually every job. We greatly appreciate her eye for detail, and we frequently get compliments from renters about how sparkling clean our homes are following her work. One thing that stands out is Molly's willingness to go the extra mile to get things done.

We are very grateful to have Molly on our team and recommend her without reservation to anyone looking for a top quality, absolutely trustworthy cleaner.",5

9028,"Super bummed. It took FOREVER to find parking (not subways fault, just inconvenient) so by the time I found a spot I was just ready for a good sandwich. Got in there and they said ""hello"" and then continued their convo, she put on gloves and went through what i wanted, while the lady at the registers phone went off over and over. I tried to make small talk ""how's your day?"" And she didn't even look up at me, said something I couldn't hear and then continued talking with the other lady. Asked for *A LOT* of pickles (don't judge me, I like pickles!) she put a regular amount, I asked for more and she pinched a few more from the bucket, didn't really seem to want to give me anymore. Paid $10 for my order and the cashier had some sort of Bluetooth in her ear, as I filled my drink I realized she was on the phone. Rude. Got home and the bread is stale. I get that subway isn't everyone's ideal job but maybe they could hire people that know how to at least ACT like they want to be there. I'll drive a little further up the road to the other location next time for sure.",1

Also, last time I went there, I made a stink about the drug test and about how it charged my insurance so much. The girl took me into a back room away from listening ears in the reception area and told me I could just pay $20 on top for my co-pay and if the results come back negative, they will just through away the results.

We search for our seats and no one could find them. The usher sits us and says enjoy. Seconds later this guy, Mike (a supervisor) comes up and says you can't sit here. We say no worries please help us find our seat. He says (with the shit face) this is your seat but I gave it to someone else! With a asshole straight face and tells us to move. But it was our seat! Way to go hiring manager. You hired a good one. No customer service skills whatsoever. Is this how you you treat your visitors?
Mike sucks. Merry Christmas to us",1
9050,"This was an amazing restaurant and definitely a little hidden downtown spot. We found this place while searching for somewhere to eat before the Hornets game and we were so glad we found it. An easy walk from our hotel (about 20 blocks away) and easy to find. 

The service was exceptional and the food was even better! We started with fried pickle chips for the appetizer and they were amazing, then my fianc√© selected The Melt for the burger he wanted....he described it as the best burger he has ever put in his mouth. That's saying something folks. We both got sides of Mac and cheese and it was the most interesting Mac and cheese I have ever ate. There was the traditional cheese flavor but there were also flavored of garlic and Parmesan which made it even better. After dinner I was almost tempted to get The Velvet which was fried ice cream served with red velvet cake and chocolate syrup (or something...I was distracted by the fact that there was fried ice cream and red velvet cake together). Fortunately for our bodies we didn't get that but next time I will need to not get food and just get dessert. 

This place is definitely one you should check out and enjoy the wonderful atmosphere, crazy music videos, and the fantastic food!!!",5

The second time I went in I bought a vehicle from Melissa who was working in the service department. Let me just start by saying she is the best sales person I have ever worked with! She got me out of my car at great price. They really know sense of value when it comes to trade-ins. Melissa got me a great deal on my vehicle as well. It was probably the easiest smoothest transaction I've ever experienced at a car dealership, and I should know because  I hate dealerships!! The best part was they weren't pushy at all. Melissa especially was easy to get a long with and made 100% sure I was taken care of. Anytime I needed anything or had a questions she didn't make me wait, she would respond immediately. I really can't say enough good things about my salesperson Melissa or the dealership.

9058,"Finally got to go here and I was not disappointed! We went last night, a Friday night, around 6:30 and didn't have to wait too long. There was a cocktail server that brought us drinks within a few minutes Waiting gave us time to look over the menu as well. 

There were three of us and we decided to do an appetizer and two pizzas. For our app we got the burrata, recommended by our server. It was good, nothing amazing, but good. It was a little bland for me, so I added the basil garnish which gave it a little something of what it was lacking. And for pizzas we got the Big Star and the Chef's Whim. Both were absolutely amazing and I don't think I could pick a favorite. The Big Star has Schreiner's sausage, Molinari pepperoni, red and yellow bell peppers, mushrooms, olives, and wood roasted onions. Everything on the pizza was great, even the olives were tolerable and I hate olives. Probably some of the best pepperoni I have ever had. The Chef's Whim that night had sauteed shrimp, sweet yellow corn, asparagus, peppers (some kind of small, sweet red peppers), lemon zest, cheese blend and instead of red sauce it was a roasted garlic sauce. I was surprised at how amazing this pizza was! 

I'm not sure what people are talking about when they say bad service because our service was on point. Our beer and wine came out within a couple minutes during our entire meal. Our waters were topped off by at least four servers, plates were cleared right after finishing, and box and check came out right after we asked. We had an awesome experience and we will definitely be going back soon! We will also be taking advantage of their drive thru option :)",5

It was noticed by several others. She also had a friend ""Boy"" hanging out at the counter visiting while we were there and he wasn't eating just taking up a spot. It was distasteful to say the least. I'm sure the Health Dept would shut it down if they witness this.",1

They make sure that the customer gets their moneys worth. I order pizza from them occasionally and today i ordered their panzerotti for the first time and it was a pleasant surprise. The dough was definitely not over powering like i see in other pizza places and it was cooked and did not feel raw. The food felt comforting. Defiantly I would visit this place over and over again!,5

If you look through the front window from outside, you will not see anything because they are all fogged up!! When you walk in, you will know why... there are steamers warming the dim sums and the rice they sell. Dim Sums are $1.75 per order and Rice with chicken/beef/spare ribs are $3.50 with tea or coffee.

There are also Chinese buns and Western style cakes... I have to say the slice cakes are the smallest I ever seen! priced between $1.50 to $1.70, they are so thinly sliced!! It is an embrassment when you trying to get it for your friends and they wondering how cheap I am when the cake slice is so small!

The lady that served me just give me that tiny cake slice and asked me to hold on to it and go pay at the cashier?!! Gee... at least help me put it in a bag or something.. 

There are some seatings if you do decide to eat in... but I don't think it will be a pleasure experience, since you will smell like dim sum after and your glasses might be all fogged up because of the steam...

Cash Only!",1

I'm a picky eater and couldn't find one thing I'd change about it. Tender meat, perfectly cooked veggies, swimming in the most delicious sauce anyone has ever dreamed of! 

I devoured my to-go lunch and seriously considered going back for a second order. This will be my new weekly ritual as their entire menu is reasonably priced and the food tastes phenomenal!",5

9085,"Staff at the front are very dysfunctional. Came in and saw the doctor in a timely manner. Receptionist mixed up where I had to wait. Ended up waiting almost 2 hours only to realize that she sent me to sit in the wrong area. After seeing me wait for a long period of time she was still unable to direct me to the right area. It wasn't until I had waited for 2 hours that I came up and asked about how long the wait is, the other receptionist directed me to the back of the clinic. Total waste of time",1
9086,"I stopped by late night to get some food, the burgers and everything were great, however the 15 minutes I had to wait in the drive thru and the French fries were not.

9087,"I'm wondering if The Living Room is transitioning to a self service restaurant? I get it, sometimes the Stars deliver a most eminent ass whooping upon servers who are just trying to keep it together. Sadly, that's not the case with The Living Room. I've been in 3 seperate times recently, all of which the restaurant was seemingly empty. Yet, the servers (whom I can only assume are named Regina, Gretchen, and Karen) couldn't find time between gossiping to get to our tables. After attempting to give this place ""one more try""... 3 times, I (and most likely many others) will never again get my hopes up only to be met by the cold, boney shoulders of their unimpressed waitresses. Waitresses who look down upon my money and I and think ""you can't sit with us"". 

I feel genuinely sorry for the owners who have, simultaneously, created such a beautiful atmosphere - and seriously horrible staff. One which could easily put them out of business.",1
9088,The Traditional bowl is my favorite! So delicious and fresh every time! Find this food truck before you think of going to Chipotle or Salsaritas! You can thank me later!,5

My boyfriend and I just happened to be in Pittsburgh when the PAPA (Professional Amateur Pinball Association) 13 championship was happening and we just happened to be eating at Bocktown Beer & Grill when my friend said that it was nearby. So, we went and our minds were just overwhelmed with awesome. The space is huge and amazing and filled with pinball machines everywhere as far as the eye can see. Since they only open for PAPA championships and special events throughout the year, you should be watching their website like a hawk. Never before have I seen a space that dropped my jaw this low to the ground. This is a pinball wizard's dream!",5
9100,"Amazing service and BEST chicken souvlaki!  Tasty, moist, fresh and light.
The place is super clean, so are the washrooms.  The soap smells divine. The employees were happy and having fun.  
Service was quick although they made everything to order.
Price is what you would expect. 12$ for a trio with salad.

I will be back",5

This place is the only place that carries 9 south juices in Scottsdale, which are top class. The RDA and Mod collection trumps that of more prestigious vape shops, and this place will blow up huge once it begins to get well known. Thanks Dom, this place is phenomenal.",5
9105,"Eaten here for both lunch and dinner and both times were excellent. The menu has both Thai and Vietnamese selections and the options are vast. The soup broth is very nice, homemade with the perfect level of spice. Fresh rolls are amazing with a hit of mint. They have beer and wine another plus. Prices are reasonable, very good value, enjoyed our meals and will be back!",5

9107,"It saddens me to write this review, however I must share my experience. Here's a glimpse of my horrible experience with American Family Insurance, my husband and daughter was hit from the back by a semi several years ago. We had full coverage insurance, my husband settled his suit against the driver and American Family refused to allow us to take advantage of Med-Pay, which was $5,000. Now it's time for my daughter to take advantage of the medical payment assistance and American Family Insurance was refusing to return my attorneys calls or emails nor responding to written communication. We've received this letter after I took to twitter for a response, I'm extremely disappointed they're refusing to not just pay the medical expenses and eliminate any claim on repayment due to my husband not being able to take advantage of the Med-Pay assistance. I will never be able to refer this for profit insurance company to anyone!",1

9110,"I stayed here in the late 90's and enjoyed a pleasant getaway.......THEN. 

Oh, my---things have changed.  The bathroom was in really bad shape, with a non-draining sink and black mold on the ceiling above the shower. Light switches didn't work. Absolutely no outlet covers in the room. Only one lamp was semi-functioning.  No mini-fridge. There was a water stain on the ceiling above the bed.  What happened to Hilton standards?  I've stayed in plusher Motel 6's. 

I realize Las Vegas hotels see a lot of guest turnover and things can get battered, but this was horrible.

The parking situation in also unacceptable. The Flamingo's structure houses a Hertz rental car return, and several levels are used for those autos and valet service (we never could get into the valet line). Plan to park way out back near Koval Street if you're lucky to find a spot in the overflow lot. Wear comfy shoes.

Carlos & Charlie's served up lukewarm Mexican food that wasn't too tasty--order the hamburger, not the chimichanga. Trust me!

The Flamingo needs a major, MAJOR overhaul.  It feels like a firetrap.",1
9114,"These guys did the floor, backsplash, and shower surround for our bathroom remodel.  Excellent work, clean, and very professional.  Could not be happier with their service.   Immediate response and friendly service over the phone a year later when I called back to have them come do some repairs in another part of the house.   Top notch!",5

All the staff was very friendly and did everything they could to make sure I was as comfortable as Possible. 6 hours in a medical facility isn't what I would call ""fun"" but my experience was better than I expected and the staff truly made the difference.",5
9125,"Someone stole my wallet and used my credit cards here. Spirits didn't realize that a man was using a woman's credit card and let them get away with spending 700 dollars on my credit cards in 1 hr. Trashy place. I'm glad I've never been there, I'm just pissed they let someone use my credit cards for such a big purchase. Every time I call this place no one answers as well. Sketchy stuff go on here, I don't recommend it.",1
9126,"Very satisfying!

I had passed this place a few times but never tried it until last night.  I am glad I did!  The food was fresh and fast and delicious! 

 I also have to praise the service. I was hungry when I arrived and the waitress suggested that maybe they hold off on some of the plates as I may not have room (you order all the food at once) She was right! !! Thank you! !

We will definitely  be coming back!",5

9132,"Wow!!! Wow!!! I'm not surprised with the bad reviews and I am a little surprised that there are no more of them. These people are the most unprofessional property manager company I have ever known! Sara is rude, and overexert for authority with a very extremely negative attitude and definitely the biggest liar I have ever seen in my life! I used to work for a property management company and my regional vice president would have been fired if he treated the tenants the way that Sarah does! Lisa is also a liar because she told me that Sarah does not have any one above her and now I they are retaliating against me by telling me they are not renewing my lease for another year just because I had to complain for one year about the absorbent water bills I was getting due to the fact that they couldn't not properly fix the irrigation system that continue to leak!",1
9133,This place is awesome! Only wish we lived nearby to stop by every week! One bowl is enough for 2 people but you will be left craving for more. Totally worth to eat one all on your own!,5
9135,"We were recently in Cleveland for a U2 concert.  On Sunday I wanted a good brunch and I couldn't have found a better spot.  They accommodated our group of 9 easily.  Their al fresco dining is tops.  We sat outside in a cool cabana.  Everyone in our group loved it, which is a huge accomplishment for a large group.  The food was amazing!  We had a vast mix of food preferences including gluten free and vegan.  The menu had something for everyone.  Bonus that everything on the menu is GMO Free.  I had the Huevos Rancheros and couldn't have been happier!  When you see your food arriving in a cast iron skillet, you know its going to be the bomb! The sweet potato hotcake is also amazing!!!!!!  They have a crepe station with an abundance of toppings and fillings.  My son's crepe was HUGE!!! They don't limit the toppings that you select....my sister in law was able to get a vegan crepe and she said it was delicious!  The maple glazed bacon is a must have too! Only complaint was from my husband who didn't care for his coconut pancake.... I think that he was just jealous after he tried my sweet potato hotcake.  My mango mimosa was also yummy.  Great prices and atmosphere.  The place was packed and rightfully so.  We even had a balloon specialist visit out table to make balloon hats and animals.  No kids were in our group which made it even more fun! The ambience, food, and friendly staff make this place a winner. This will always be on our list whenever we visit Cleveland!!!",5
9136,"I'm not even giving this place one star it's THAT bad. No matter how good a deal you think you are getting, RUN from this disgusting place. The room smells like cat pee and they don't bother to clean it up and just let the disgusting, unsanitary conditions persist. If you complain they shrug their shoulders at you. They lie about changing the sheets - so you sleep on dirty sheets. I'd rather stay at the Bates motel!",1
9139,"Lets start at the beginning. A few years back (Mortuary's last year open) we decided to check out as many haunted houses as possible in Las Vegas. We started with 13th floor at Circus Circus....good for small children. Then we went to the Fright Dome... Okay, but I though WOW I am getting old. Got a few screams and startles out of me, the general area had people that startled me more than the attractions themselves. The we went to the Trilogy of Terror.  OMG best night ever. Went on a Thursday and felt as if we were the haunts targeted victim. We ended up meeting the Father Son team that created Trilogy of Terror, because they had concerns for my boyfriend who walks with a cane going through the haunts. Nicest guys ever.  We went to about 6 more haunts in Las Vegas and on Halloween weekend ended up back at Trilogy of Terror. The next year mortuary was taken down and Gates of Hell was open. Not to give anything away, but there was a part where the  floor your standing on drops about an inch. I screamed so loud and (my new thing I do Laugh when I am nervous) started laughing uncontrollably that the terrorist/Cast Member asked if I was alright. We have already gone once with friends this year. When we got there this year, you are greeted by people who take your picture in front of a green screen, my first thought was just another way to make money. Well I have to say I was impressed with there pictures and the pricing.  In fact we ended up purchasing 4 pictures, so everyone in our party could have one. if you can only go to ONE place this year for your haunting experience this should be the place. Great for little and big kids. We took a 12 year old with us this year and while the other adults went into the Gates of Hell, he didn't feel left out because we went and got him a picture. So frickin cool.....We don't even try the other haunts anymore. This IS as good as it gets.",5
9140,"Who doesn't love them some Chipotle?

Everything is good here, and portion sizes are huge--come hungry.  My personal favorite are the Burrito Bols which are a kind of salad-burrito hybrid.

The Cilantro lime rice they serve here would make any dish taste good.  Green tomatillo salsa is outstanding.

This place gets super crowded, so be ready to wait in line.",5
9141,"First time here and I'm sold! Brought my almost 3 year old and he loves his food too! I got brisket and pulled pork, onion tangles (amazing!) and Mac n cheese. He got the polish sausage and green beans.  Got 10% off for being a first timer so my bill was just under $16!!! Turns out you get a free ice cream come too! Flavor is legit for BBQ. Kids eat free on Sunday's so- I know we will be back!",5
9142,"I've been biking for most of my life and honestly indoor cycling has always seemed like a terrible idea to me.  Spinning classes are for girls, there's no way they could be a good alternative to a real bike.  Well the other day I took a class here instead of braving the rain and I might be a completely changed man.   I found myself working harder than I would have on the road, so this might be an excellent training mechanism for road riders.  I also like the overall ""feel"" of this place...they definitely seem to embrace their community, plus it sounds like they're going to have a presence with a lot of the local road rides.

Definitely worth checking out if you're usually on the road but looking for a different way to train, or just a good substitute for a crappy day.",5
9144,"I have been to this Ted Wiens a couple of times & have'nt had any problems.""Keep in mind that I only went there for a tire change & smog check"". Though this last time was over the top the worst.

Scenerio: I had been noticing my girlfriends car blowing out white smoke when I start it & during travel...""which is never good"". I took my truck in & after 1 hour from the time I dropped it off they said that they cleaned something (I forget) & that the problem was solved, they suggested that I get 2 other things done as a precaution & all of this would be under $500. Feeling better that it was'nt anything major I told them to go ahead. The next day after this service I notice the same problem, took it back to them & they said to keep driving it & it will eventually go away. 3 days went past with NO relief so I took it to Findlay Toyota were they broke the bad news. My girlfriend had sludge,(which they showed me) in the motor & to get the smoke to stop it would cost $5000 for a new one or $3000 to clean this one. If I would've known this from Ted Weins I would've not gone through with the $500 repair. I went back to Ted Weins & they said Toyota was wrong,(even after I saw it with my own eyes) & after arguing with the rude manager & the mechanic who worked on my car(who was puffing up his chest like he wanted to fight) they gave me $62 back for the labor. 

That was a crock of bull!!!",1
9145,"I always come back to Pittsburgh to have me some Pierogies, and I always forget how they taste. And I quickly get reminded that they truly are amazing.

Forgotten Taste has such an amazing flavor. We ordered meatballs and gravely over potato and cheese Pierogies, and it didn't take long for us to finish them! 

Definitely a place to come back to when I'm back in town.",5
9148,"My family including grandma came here for a celebratory dinner and had a fabulous time. It was my grandma's birthday and the staff really went out of their way to make her feel special.

I had what I think was called Penne con Salmon and it was out of this freaking world. I daydreamed about it for days afterward and I know I will order it again.  It had lox and fresh salmon in it, and it was so perfectly creamy and well-spiced. My family members also enjoyed their dishes and the drinks were all fantastic. Our wait staff was wonderful - professional, non-intrusive, friendly, and quick. Plus one of them personally serenaded my grandma in Italian and she loved it!

I absolutely want to come again and hope to be known as the regular who always orders that salmon dish!",5

If you come in when Manny's working, you're in for an even greater treat with his attention to detail in service.  Try the octopus fritters, if you like calamari you will like these too.

9156,"I had the Bacon and Fig Flatbread.  It was phenomenal!! I was in a hurry and the staff was extremely accommodating. Chef James whipped it up in under 10 min from scratch. The fig and crescenza and blue cheese additions to the flatbread gave it some delicious sophistication.   Would definitely come back and I heard the Peach Cobbler is really good.  Bradley and Joe did an incredible job with the menu and decor, really liked the back patio as well.  Nice touch gents and best of success on your first entrepreneurial venture together.",5

The vending machine to buy soap doesn't take money or credit cards, it only take their proprietary 'easy pass' card (or something). You buy the EP card from what used to be a change machine, but it won't give you change. If you put in $20, you buy a $20 card or nothing (we're traveling and had 1 small load of laundry to do). The ""attendant"" does anything BUT attend...she rolls around with her ear buds in and can't hear anything you say, and then busied herself flirting with a guy and wasn't interested in helping although it was clear that we were having trouble. We had to leave to get change for a $20 to use in the stupid easy pass machine, but it won't take the money. We re-packed our dirty clothes and left. They could not have made it and LESS convenient!

They had everything from books, toys, tools and clothing.

I may not be in the 'lifestyle' but if I was I would for sure go to this store all the time ;-)",5

I really can't put into words how thankful I am that my dentist recommended me to this practice! Dr. Meisami is not only brilliant and thorough at what she does, but very kind  and eased all my anxieties. My years of phobias over this surgery subsided the moment I had my first assessment. I received a call from the nurse Iryna the morning after my procedure to check up on me and see how I'm doing. (and to remind me to eat properly etc, such a caring nurse!)",5
9180,"Terrible company overall. The only good news: So far, on day 5 from getting my car back, transmission seems to be fixed. I am one to hardly ever complain, however, the 4 weeks that my car was at CofC was a disaster. During the first two weeks of my car being there, and some poor communication on where my car stood in getting completed, we were given several stories of parts being lost, ""drilled into wrong"", angry employees leaving and possibly ""sabotaging"" parts, an employee ""leaving on his deathbed due to cancer"", and day after day being told ""it will only be another day or two"" until it was ready. We lost faith after the first two weeks with this local shop, only for the nonsense to continue with the GM-Mr. Jody Preston when we brought our concerns and wanted a significant discount. Needless to say once we shared our concerns, we were laughed at when asking for a discount, made to feel ignorant and even were bullied when GM declared that he was ""wondering if we even had the money to pay to get the car back"". During the last conversation we had with GM he hung up on us blatantly making us aware that this company and owner, Fred Bowen do not care for its customers. After A LOT of work was done on our end, the only discount that the GM and customer service rep agreed upon was to reimburse for half of the rental car rate we ensued. Customer Service rep listened to our concerns over 45 minutes and agreed that our ""story sounds terrible and just BAD"", however the final say was up to the GM and the owner ""will probably back up his GMs"". I highly recommend NOT using this shop for your car care needs.",1
9181,"Me and my friend had reservations here and shot rifles here and the experience was beyond amazing. They have a wide selection of guns to choose from in different packages. Our instructor Chris was not only instructive, but very informational, professional, and extremely motivated which made me motivated!! Because of him I will be coming back in the future. The setup inside was very cool, customer service at the desk was excellent. I'd say the only downside is that ammo is very pricey for how much they give you (see their website for rates), so be prepared to spend. Other than that, this is definitely a thing to do on the strip if you love guns.",5

I've also called in with questions and Suki is always very helpful. She makes sure you get exactly what you have in mind and she will make you look good. And yes, the upgrade options are definitely worth it!! Also, I appreciate the delivery driver too. He won't hesitate to call IF any question needs answered or specific direction needs given.

I will not speak in length of the old d√©cor as it has no more relevance to the epitome of swank that is the new look at Green. I won't talk about the recycled material art that lined the South wall that included lightly painted utensil drawer organizers and VW hubcaps. I also won't talk about the slightly preachy overly optimistic quote that wrapped the wall through the corner near the restrooms written in a fun script only an undergrad girl studying design theory and armed with a paint brush could achieve. I also won't mention the antique Piano up against the dividing wall that in spirit only begged one thing of whoever laid eyes on it, it's modest demand was to be played in a manner worthy of the Saloons that once occupied the desert space where Green now lies, yet the only text on the instrument was a small sign written with a marker saying "" Please Do Not Play Piano"". I also won't talk about the loooooong table going from front door to register that on busy nights you'd get stuck sitting at with two of your friends only to have your back brushed against by numerous vegetarian butts that graze only on accident and rarely warrant an apology but still. . . no buns on the back please.  
I will however mention their new patio that has arrived just in time for the cold season when dining on said patio will surely manifest in me a tension worthy of Hitchcock's direction between enjoying sweater weather with solely my hot entr√©e or hitting the tipping point of finger numbing cold with my seemingly mandatory post-dinner Tsoynami. The caged in effect achieved by the patio might be resonant to that of a human cage, which to give credit to the designer might be the intent. The subtext of the patio may read something to the effect of Peter Signer's breakthrough work, Animal Liberation, eliciting the contradictory feeling of being outside and feeling claustrophobic and caged in thus allowing the patron to empathize with the plight of factory farmed animals and subsequently prompting the euphoric smugness that comes from the knowledge that no animals were harmed or exploited in making that mock steak po'boy (except maybe the dudes in the kitchen scraping by for minimum wage*). The vintage car doors are still in effect over freshly vinyled booths that safely seat four, but typically six, partially due to their limited seating and mostly due to the nearly miniature size of the average patron who tend to be slight, frail and eager to show they don't mind a little contact. 
The alternative girl vibe that exudes from the front of the house staff meshes well with the obvious southwestern conventionality of the kitchen staff. A ""powerclash"" in true form. If you disregard their post-Juno fashion choices you see some of the nicest, under-tipped, funny people in the local service industry. Calling in an order is as easy as vegan pie and pretty swift too. I've frequented this location for 5 years and don't intend to stop anytime soon. The Secret BBQ ""Chicken"" sandwich is at the top of the charts but if not that then the Argentine Po'boy is a fine choice as well. Hands down one of my favorite places in the Valley.

Here's a Tip: don't be a dummy, add Chai to your Tsoynami.

*I have no idea how the kitchen staff is compensated.",5
9188,"Best pizza in Cleveland!

I came here with some friends for the first time.  We each ordered a different pizza, and all tried pieces from each others; each one was better than the last.  My favorite was the Verde (white pizza with spinach, italian sausage, green onions, and crushed pistachios).  This is true Italian style pizza, which is very thin and light, so you're probably going to want to eat a whole pizza.  One minor issue is that the pizza oven can only make a couple of pizzas at a time, so if you go in a group, your pies might come out at different times.  However, this issue is quickly forgotten about when you realize how delicious the pizza is.  You can tell a lot of thought and expertise went into designing each of the pizzas on the menu.  The ingredients and the dough were fresh and the pizzas had so much flavor!

The restaurant is tiny, but the atmosphere is cozy and stylish.  No, they don't serve free glasses of water, but I get it.  This is a new place that took a chance on the neighborhood, and they're trying to make it work; $30,000 pizza ovens imported from Italy take awhile to pay off.  

I'm looking forward to coming back and sampling the other pizzas; hopefully they'll rotate the menu, and have some seasonal specialties.",5
9189,"George does makes some good donuts. I still prefer Jack Frost above all. My friend at work brought some in today. He said the hours are super early and you need to arrive early. Why don't people bring healthy snacks to work? It is never fruit or vegetable trays. Is this self destructive behavior the result of being trapped in a building during the daylight hours? Or are these attempts to thin the heard and ensure that the weaker and sicker people die off thus allowing job security during lay offs and budget trimming? I don't know what it is, I know that these donuts are good as can be though!",5
9191,"I love Dr. Alamo!  My husband and I have been patients for years and have always received the best care from him.  There may be a wait from time to time, but I'd rather have a wait for an excellent doctor than be seen quickly by a terrible one!  He takes the time to listen to concerns and he's all for a conservative approach.  If you're looking for a pain pill fix - he's not the doctor for you.  If you're looking for a doctor that is going to give you quality care and expects you to be a part of the solution - he's the tops!",5
9193,"Thank you for fitting me in your busy schedule Christine, I will be back. Always happy to support a small business with such friendly service!",5
9194,"Good Day:
Thank you for reading my post.  Tacos 101 did not deliver at all on their tacos.  I was looking forward to eating at the restaurant considering all of the positive posts.
The service, ambience were pleasurable for how small the business is.
The tacos were extremely small and not hot or tasty whatsoever.  I was expecting a better product and experience.  
The size of the tacos are appetizer size so make sure you order a few to satiate 
yourself. Govern yourself accordingly, Taco Bell is open and available for Mexican food.",1
9198,"Sunday night my sister flew in from Canada. She wanted some authentic Mexican cuisine so I brought her to Carlsbad. We were served by Jeff who explained that the food is actually New Mexican cuisine, they use peppers in nearly every dish from hatch peppers to habanero and everything in between. Jeff mentioned that he was new to the restaurant and imediately I thought oh no... I thought our service would be slow but he really changed my mind quickly. He was very knowledgable about most everything and he really did an amazing job making is laugh. He suggested the brochettes and potstickers for appetizers which were very good. We also ordered the pasta dish with Chipotle chicken as suggested it was amazingly flavorful. Overall I would give our service and the meal 10 stars if I could.",5
9199,"I had an opportunity to dine with some close friends while in town, which was only topped by this meal.

Where do I begin to explain ? First let me describe the service, they were beyond friendly! But not in a bad way, they were extremely attentive to every detail.

As an example my friend has a serous gluten intolerance and the server made sure she knew which items contained gluten, or a gluten binder. But wait for it, they actually asked the kitchen to not use the binders on the mushrooms, and brought out gluten free bread.

Now that's service.

 Next our meal. We all each had the 35 day aged Australian filet. It was ""cut with a fork"" tender.

We enjoyed the beets, baked Alaskan and a delicious concoction of mushrooms and gravy.

I am so impressed that the memory of it will last for a very long time.

Bring your favorite person(s) and go celebrate food.",5
9200,"Wow. The place is pretty, but don't expect ""high end"" as they tout on their website.  It's basically Timbers with much better atmosphere. 
We joked from the start that our waitress hated us but it became clear that it wasn't a joke, she actually did hate us, or maybe just her job. We're pretty happy go-lucky so we can handle a hard attitude; she reminded me of my BFF, I actually texted my BFF and said she should never be a server Lol We laughed it off, we weren't here for her company anyway. 
To bad the food was terrible. We had the potstickers (which were the best dish despite being a bit on the spicy side), artichoke dip (excited to see it come w crostini but surprisingly the chips were way better than the bread. The dip itself was so-so), and I had the fish and chips which were very bland (but the fish was better the next day in the toaster), I hardly touched the tastless fries which was a big part of why I ordered fish n chips to begin with. 
Then we made the huge mistake of ordering dessert.  We wanted it to-go but were told we couldn't get 2 (out of 3) desserts to-go due to the fact they are served in Mason jars. This is crazy to me. I get it, it's hipster cool, but I've had other restaurants that do it that way know how to send their creations to-go. I asked if they could just pour it into a to-go container and that I wouldn't hold it against the chef (I mean, it couldn't be worse than dinner, right?) So we ordered the chocolate cream pie and chocolate chip cookies.  We had already paid our bill and were just waiting on desserts. After 10 minutes our server walked by and said ""Have a good night"", we reminded her we were waiting on dessert, ""Oh right, let me go check on that"". She came back and told us the cookies are baked to order so they take a bit (anyone whos ever baked cookies knows they take 12 mins tops. And anyone whos ever worked in a restaurant that had a made-to-order dessert also knows to mention the wait time to the customer at some point!)
After 20 minutes SO tried to get her attention to ask about dessert to which she snapped back (across the section) ""Sir, the.cookies.are.made.to.order!""
After 30 minutes we got our desserts. 
The chocolate ""cream"" pie is pudding (with whipped cream and crumbled grahams). Although, the kitchen did know how to make it to go, very nicely packaged in a soup container. The chocolate chip cookies were good, 4 thin cookies fresh from the oven (probably take about 7 minutes to bake).

$80 for 2 beers, 3 apps, 1 main, 2 desserts.
Unreal.
Better off throwing another $30 to that and going to The Melting Pot for a fine dining experience where the staff treat you well and the Chef aims to please.",1
9201,"Came here for the first time by word of mouth. Service was great, they cook the meat for you which is also of great quality. Atmosphere is lively with good music. The area we sat in was kind of dark though we were tucked away in the corner. You can bring your own wine and there's no corkage fee. They also have free slushies and misters outside while you're waiting to be sat.",5
9202,"I'm really sad after reading all these comments, me and my boyfriend were planning to move here because it's everything we're looking for. The staff was super nice but after reading all the comments I think I'm going to have to pass up on this apartment. 
Thanks everyone for the feedback, you get what you pay for I suppose :(
Also if you guys scroll all the way down there is more reviews they don't recommend you to read!",1
9204,"Called to get a quotation for Audi Q5 brake replacement.  Craig told me that they can only quote  upon physically inspecting the car.  

Thought it was unusual, but trusted good Yelp reviews, I interpreted it positively - perhaps the shop pays attention to details. 

When arrived, Craig came out and asked some info.  Provided all and expected he would start checking the required parts and provide a quotation.  But instead, he asked me to leave the key and wait.  It was getting little awkward....drove 30 mins and wait 45 mins just to get a quote??  

When I complained, the attitude Craig showed me was indeed unprofessional.  

Not sure if it is this person or the general attitude of the shop....in any case, they should definitely learn what ""customer oriented"" means.  

What a waste of time and energy.",1
9205,"What a gem! I must have driven by this place a million times and never knew it was here. Thanks to a fellow yelper for introducing me! 
The place is sexy and mysterious - you feel like you know something others don't simply by stumbling into Merc Bar. 
Staff was so nice, drinks were delicious, and the Moscow Mules were a treat. I'll be back.",5
9207,Every trip to Vegas always includes a trip to Big Al's. The food has always been good.  Service has always been good if not great.  No complaints ever.,5
9212,"My friend and I decided to eat here for lunch recently after reading the good reviews on Yelp. We were not disappointed. When we first arrived, they were giving out samples of the caramel sea salt milkshake, freakin amazing. I would have ordered one but even though I love milkshakes, they don't always love me back. 
I ordered the Greek (lamb) burger; it comes medium rare, which I was fine with. I also wanted to mention that I ordered a gluten free bun, which, by the way, they make in house, very tasty, really quite delicious (not dry and cardboard tasting like Udi's). My friend got the Buffalo Bill (bison) burger and he liked it a lot. We split a large fries, and, although they informed us in advance that that the fries would come out first, I found that a bit odd, but no points off for that, since we ate all of them and they were pretty decent fries. Their sodas are quite unique, by Maine Root; I opted for the Prickly Pear lemonade soda, very sweet. No high fructose corn syrup in these babies! My friend got the Mexicane Cola and he enjoyed it. Overall it was a very good experience and we would definitely return.",5
9213,"My husband and I were driving from Warren to Kent and wanted to have a good lunch along the way.  We were not disappointed!  I ordered the James Harrison and my husband had the Arsenio Hall.  The James Harrison was ridiculously amazing.  The caramelized onions were cooked perfectly.  With the BBQ sauce, mayo, cheese and onion ring, I thought it might be too much but it was delicious.  My husband said his Arsenio Hall was also great.  They even had ice cream, but we were too full to try it out.  Unfortunately, I won't be able to come here more often since I live in Texas.  I highly recommend this restaurant!",5
9214,Great for a light lunch or dinner.  Awesome service and atmosphere.  We loved it - highly recommended!!,5
9216,"Dr. DePry is amazing! I just completed my first appointment with her yesterday. She specializes in reproductive health and it shows - she really knows her stuff!

9221,Got on Rich's guest list for XS. The guys had to pay half the price but we didn't complain because it was worth it. The previous night I had to pay $50 to get in as a girl. We also got into Rehab which was really nice.,5
9222,"This is by far the best value in buffets in the vegas area.
Have been asked repeatedly by a friend if I had tried the Buffet @ The M Casino and finally decided to give it a try.
Went at 2:15 in the afternoon on a thursday and waited an hour to get in.
If you know me you might know that I am slightly impatient.  Well standing in line speaking with a few locals eased the pain of the wait.
Well worth the wait, Never was able to get to the opposite end because I was so full of the great food selection.
I never even made it to the desert bar (just amazing looking), Way to full .
Just another note, Beer & Wine included in lunch & dinner buffets.
2 Thumbs up from this foodie !

Also ran into Michael Jackson's dad Joe here.",5
9223,"I signed up for a Yelp account just so I could review this restaurant. Best Italian food I've ever had besides my Grama's. I'm so upset that its in Vegas and I can't eat there everyday. ( I tried to get them to let me live there in exchange for free food, they said they'd think about it.....) We had the Caesar salad, spaghetti & meatballs, their garlic rolls and our friends had the warm spinach salad, every single thing was amazing. The server/owner Domenico was adorable and so nice. He called my friend signorina and she blushed and giggled like a little girl. My only disappointment was that I found it on the last day and we only got to eat there once. Can't wait to get back to Vegas!",5
9224,Had my mother n laws retirement party on the back patio. The staff and food were awesome! Very accommodating. Will use again for sure.,5
9225,I mean I'm gonna start out by saying I was obviously here during shift change. That being said there's way too many employees they don't interact with customers my bartender Kimmie left without checking on me so I went 20 min at a bar completely ignored. The clam chowder was like a gravy and cool. This place is super unfriendly unengaging unprofessional the food is so super basic I do NOT recommend wasting ur time OR money here,1
9226,"When my regular massage girl moved back home I was stuck with no good options.  Thankfully I stumbled across Nature's Spa and I'm glad I did.

Joy is a friggin' godsend.  The woman's got hands that go from piercing steel (to get out those stubborn muscle knots) to feather light within the same movement.  You can feel her experience as she knows exactly how to unlock the muscles for a deep seated relief.  When I hopped off her table I was light headed and felt like jello.

I can't recommend this lady enough.  She's cool as hell to chat with if you're in the mood or quiet as a church mouse if that's what you're looking for.  Good massage therapists (with real solid experience) are very hard to find, so now that I've found her I'm not letting go.  Even if she moves back home I'm tempted to follow her.

The one reservation I had in writing this review is that if more people know about her then I'll have a tougher time booking a table.",5

9229,"It was my birthday recently and I decided I wanted a tattoo. I had been thinking about it for a while so I asked all my friends where they got theirs. I also drove all over Vegas in order to get quotes and check out portfolios.

Not only did Bad Apple have some of the most talented artists, they also quoted me the best price for my tattoo. I had my tattoo done by Ez, who was recommended to me by a friend, and he gave me the best price compared to all the other tattoo parlors in town.

My tattoo is an solid black symbol on my left pec, so its pretty simple. Ez charged me $150, while other places quoted me from $220 all the way to $400!!! The other artists there are also friendly, and try to address you as soon as they can when they're not busy.

I highly recommend this place and Ez if you're looking to get a new tattoo.",5
9232,Went in for the first time today. It was taco Tuesday. Amazing fish and potato street tacos and super cheap! I will definitely be back! Thanks for the excellent service. :),5
9234,"Oh man. 
This place has great large rooms which are really villas with kitchen, whirlpool, etc. it ends there. If I could give negative stars, I would.¬†
The customer service is beyond horrible.¬†
1. They did not write down the Internet access information when we checked in, so I tried to call the front desk, and was placed on hold for 17 minutes before finally giving up. My husband then walked to the front desk to get the information and was told that it was written on his card packet at check-in (it wasn't) but they told him it was a disaster at the desk (there was a long line) and that he had to go back and check the card packet. He came back to the room to get it to show them nothing was written. So they finally wrote down the info, barely apologized, and while my husband was standing there another man came in furious about being on hold on his phone for so long. An hour later, we finally were able to use Internet, but only one device at a time.¬†
2. In order to use the free shuttle (which only runs once per hour) you have to sign up. Fine. But when we called the front desk to register, we were told that you must sign up in person. So even sitting on the phone giving them a specific time doesn't work. Had to walk over there again to deal with their ridiculously poor service.¬†
3. Our key cards kept not working on the outside fence. We had to go get new keys three times and still they would stop working. There is no way to prop the gate open except to put a piece of furniture or luggage in it. So frustrating to get locked out every other time! 
4. Our room was poorly serviced, they sloppily made the sleeper bed but not the regular bed, and didn't replace all of the towels. The ceiling is paper thin and it sounded like our upstairs neighbors were moving furniture all the time.¬†
5. When my husband told the manager he had several issues, she was very indifferent and said he was welcome to come and talk to her (?!) but that she was the only one at the desk at the time (so, in other words, later.)¬†
6. Our main issue, we had a small trailer that we were traveling with that easily fits in a standard parking space and were told that it is against their policy to have any type of trailer on the property (however, there was a Uhaul trailer sitting outside all weekend) ... We had a two room villa with 7 people that easily justifies two parking spaces, but were forced to park it across the street in their unguarded lot, then told that they had no liability for it (part of the reason for booking this property is the guarded entry... But now our trailer is unprotected. It does NOT state this policy on the booking sites.) We woke up the second morning to a graffiti tag on it, had to make a police report, and Westgate just repeated their no trailer policy and said they were sorry and their guard had been watching it. Really?!¬†
If you are considering this hotel, don't. You will be sorry. We've stayed in hotels literally across the globe, and this was hands down one of the worst experiences.",1
9236,"This place is such a pleasant break-away from the mundane chains and franchises in the area. The food is delicious. I had a dog, my husband a burger. Both were so good! It's got a simple, nostalgic feel that reminds me of the small town I grew up in. Very friendly. We'll go back soon!",5
9237,"I could not even consider giving this place less then 5 stars. First, the selection is diverse, and the food is of great quality and fresh. There is not only a wide array of various food types and styles, but the dessert bar is also amazing, serving up creme brulee' and gelato! My 2 favorite points:

-All you can drink beer and wine! 

-The price per quality is out of this world. $15 dollars for what I received was unreal
(Lunch price). I thought it was a trick, and was expecting a National Lampoons style buffet. I was pleasantly surprised when i did not receive it. There are many great buffets on the strip, however, the food here is amazing and given at an unmatchable price! Enjoy at your own risk!",5
9238,"Wonderful experience! We just moved here from California and had reservations on having to find a new groomer for our mini poodle. Dazzling dog house salon did a wonderful job of making sure they met all my expectations, making my poodle look amazing and were very affordable. Highly recommend this grooming salon.",5

9240,"Terrible customer service 3 months later and still dealing with this terrible dealer. Money hungry selfish owner. Took an obnoxious amount of phone calls to get my trade in paid off and then come to find out I have a suspension problem. He makes his money and tells you to have a good day. Takes no responsibility not even for his employees. Just like the other post spray painted underneath. So embarrassing this many bad reviews and still doesn't care to fix any problems. 

I really can't stress enough to people considering buying from here. Go to a place that cares about the perception of their business. They read these threads; we talked about it when I bought my truck because I was concerned. Should have just walked away....",1

J'ai fini par ne pas manger les pois chiches et y ajouter mes propres l√©gumineuses. Et le bouillon √©tait plut√¥t fade, sans saveur particuli√®re, comme un bouillon de l√©gumes bien normal du commerce.

The food is great and the service is always good but today we we're sitting in Amber station and I just have to say she is a true asset to your company.

I asked to speak to a supervisor who finally agreed to send someone over within an hour after I cried bloody murder as it was 83 in the house and that the ac was working before they worked on it. A Yes man came and resolved the issue. Given the hassle they gave me I am seriously considering not renewing my service contract when it expires.",1
9247,"I love Bruegger's but this location is a fail.  The blonde woman working behind the counter has a scowl so deeply imbeded on her face that I felt like I was imposing on her when I placed my order. She also doesn't cut your bagel or wrap for you so be prepared to grab a knife to take back to the office.  Service is so slow that I've seen people walk out numerous times after standing in line.  

The quality of the breakfast items is not up to par with other locations.  The eggs taste like McDonald's, food prepared half assed, and the bagels are often stale.  Go to Dunkin next door or walk the extra few blocks and go to a different location.",1
9249,"From our inital visit to inquire about services, to well after the conclusion of our anniversary lunch, the service at Joey Yorkdale was exceptional.  Nathalie worked with us on every detail from specific drink requests such as holding bottles to offering child-friendly menu options.  Even when our guest list fluctuated, staff were at the ready and everyone was friendly, approachable and utterly professional.  

Our guest list o ~35 friends and family couldn't say anything negative about the experience (service, ambiance and food).  Staff were so courteous that the general manager pulled us aside to mention that the waitresses had a ""moral dilemma"" in which they felt that they were being over-tipped (we as the hosts were covering the gratuity, desserts and drinks for our guests, while they covered their entrees, thus creating a possibility where they received additional tips).  Their concern was a pleasant surprise as this type of attitude is typically non-existent elsewhere. 

My partner and I couldn't be happier with how the event unfolded.  We, along with many of our guests, would be happy to return as repeat diners.

You have excellent staff at this location.  They deserve recognition for their outstanding work ethic as they showcase exactly what quality customer service is all about.

Thanks for making our anniversary memorable!",5

While running errands, we saw a little dive Chinese restaurant that had really bad reviews and no a/c (huge negative during August in AZ), so putting a nix on that one, I consulted YELP and guided him to this place, Simi's Cafe. The food was great!!  I LOVED (not just liked) my Red Curry with Chicken and his Mongolian Beef was really good too.  Our waitress was fantastic; kind, knowledgable, attentive and our food was brought out much faster than I had anticipated. Overall great dining experience.

Folks, fast food is not sitting in line for 20 minutes +. I had already paid and didn't feel like wasting money. Then I got to the window and they had to ask me A. Did I pay? And B. What did I order?

On my first visit (of 5 minutes), I was told the MD would not prescribe HRT so I would need to come back to see another doctor, although when I called I told them what I wanted.  I was pressured into getting a mammogram and lab work and charged $380 for the visit.
 On my second visit, they completed an annual pelvic exam and still did not provide the requested treatment.  Finally on my third visit, following an  unnecessary pelvic ultrasound.  I was offered birth control pills.  Since when are all those tests needed to determine if I can have birth control pills.  Finally I requested my records so I can go to a new doctor and they want to charge me $15.  After they bilked my insurance for thousands.  DO NOT go to this office they are money-sucking pigs",1
9260,"Ordered delivery from the Yelp app. Food arrived way before the time it said which was awesome! The restaurant called me after I placed my order to confirm my order was correct which was nice. Food was hot when it arrived and everything was right. 

I ordered the fried bananas, war wonton soup, steamed pot stickers and the Thai style sweet and sour chicken everything was hot and delicious! One thing to note is be careful when ordering the sweet and sour chicken because Thai style the chicken isn't breaded which I liked but some people might get the two options they have mixed up.

I definitely recommend this place and I will order from them again!",5
9261,"I took my Highlander to get washed and shampooed today. They did an amazing job inside and out! I couldn't be happier. They even brought me out to the car to inspect it when it was done. I dealt with Curtis, who was very kind and helpful. Thanks. I will definitely be back and refer others.",5
9262,"I am amazed at the service this animal hospital gives. I visited the North Valley office in Phoenix, for the first time, to get my bunny Daisy, who is 11 months, fixed. My mom and i were both very nervous, (i am only 13) but they put our minds at ease. The nice lady on the phone was very kind and answered my questions without any annoyance in her voice, like some other animal hospitals i had called. The lady that took us back, who's name i fail to remember, handled Daisy very well. The vet Dr. Jay Johnson, was amazing with my Daisy. He answered any questions i had and explained what was going to happen. He spays about 2 bunnies a week! When we picked her up they explained to us how to give her the pain medicine, and sent us off, they then called today to check up on her. (she was spayed yesterday) as i write this she is eating her hay. It is on the pricier side, but the service was well worth it.  If you are nervous about getting your bunny spayed, then come here, they will put your mind at ease.",5
9263,Ordered a couple of sweaters online and when they arrived I found that they were too short in the sleeves for me.  I took them back to return them and found myself being grilled by the salesperson as to why I was bringing them back.  Never question returns!!!   You lose customers that way!!  Take a lesson from Nordstrom s on customer service and then you may actually have customers who like to shop at Dillards in Summerlin.   Bad experience!,1
9266,"Great fresh chips & salsa, and we had shrimp fajitas & spinach & cheese & regular cheese enchiladas & all the food was so good! Service friendly & attentive. The iced tea is passion fruit infused & yum also.",5
9267,Arrived early for a 9:00 a.m. appointment. I can't review their services as I never got in. If you book an appointment (Saturday) don't bother showing up for at least an hour afterwards unless you just have time to kill. Small office that couldn't seat the people waiting. I waited over 45 minutes with no end in sight. Frustrating to say the least. It appears they overbook and cannot service patients in a timely manner. Too many other dentists available.,1
9269,We purchased a 2017 Cadillac xt5 and love the car!  We wanted the platinum edition and our salesman Sunday and his manager Chris block worked hard to find us exactly what we were looking for!  Derrick spent the time with my wife to teach her about all the exciting options and how they work!  Great job Coulter Cadillac!,5
9271,I just tried this amazing place last night with my boyfriend! I got the chicken & avocado wrap with a side of sweet potato fries! It was super yummy and the lady that helped me out was very kind and patient. I would definitely recommend Daily Kitchen if you're trying to be healthy and get something fast!,5

I never thought it be possible for me to finally upgrade my 2011 V6 Camaro to a V8 as nice as the one I've picked up here at Goldie's. 
It's been an amazing 4 months with my new baby (2013 Camaro SS convertible )and I couldn't be any happier!

9274,"On the recommendation of a friends and family and talking with a few contractors, I chose Legacy to complete my kitchen remodel.  I was glad I did as no sooner had the project started than extensive mold issues were discovered.  This brought the project to a halt that was truly unexpectedly as mold is not that common in Arizona.  It was due to the expert advice of Legacy's project contractor and general manager and the contractor who completed the mold remediation that solutions were found to a complex set of problems that ensured passing Quality Environmental inspection an a livable space now and in the future. 

Oh and did I mention I love my new kitchen!!!!? 

Legacy and especially my project contractor gets an 
 A+ in my book.

9280,"I would not recommend going here for acrylics. I messaged the business prior to booking, and asked if they did acrylic removal. They said yes, so I proceeded to book my appointment for removal and a full set. They took off my existing acrylic nails by sticking a fake nail tip under the edges and ripping off. OUCH! It hurt so bad and the made two of my nail beds bleed.

They wouldn't let me wash the blood off before putting on the full set so I am currently fighting an infection. They nails turned out pretty (not great), but no where worth the pain! The gel polish did not cover all the edges (she filed my nails again after painting them... what?), and the lengths don't all match.

I would recommend trying somewhere else before coming here.",1
9281,"Really interesting food! I think this place has really unique, and surprisingly tasty, flavor combinations. Enjoyed the fried chicken skins, the tomato and tomatillo salad, and the creamed spelt. I was also pretty amazed with the vegan lime yogurt -- hadn't had a vegan yogurt taste so legit. Worth a try for sure.",5
9282,"Before Paradise turned into Panera, we always had terrible service at this location and inaccurate orders. We gave Panera a try hoping they would be different...but it's the same problems! We went in for dinner and there was one couple ahead of us ordering cookies. There was one employee helping them out and I counted 3 others mindlessly walking around behind the counter without a word to us or the now 4 other groups behind us.  Eventually a 4th woman, I'll assume the manager based on how she was dressed compared to the others, rudely came out and said she'd help us. She had no enthusiasm, no apology for the 15 minutes we'd already waited, and had zero friendliness...not even a smile. We placed our order and took a seat in the next-to-empty dining area. When our order came out it was all wrong. We mentioned it to the girl and she giggled like she was embarrassed and did nothing to offer to correct it. So there we sat and ate our inaccurate order not wanting to deal again with the rude manager and risk getting our food spit in or messed with some other way. The food itself was ok...the salad was mostly hard iceberg hearts. Needless to say, we will never be going back here.",1

I decided to go with a pool company & they sent out Clear Pool Solutions. In just a couple minutes after Josh arrived, he not only found the problem (which happened to be electrical) but also had our pool up and running again.  What a relief to work with a company that is so professional, prompt and RELIABLE!  Josh was excellent & explained everything perfectly.. We will definitely be using them again for all our future service calls!",5
9290,"We were on vacation from Wisconsin where the Bartolotta's are from and wanted to support them while we were there and check out one of the brother's establishments. 

It started out bad. We had RESERVATIONS and when we approached the host desk.. we were told to wait to set up the table which took 10 mins. Barely anyone in the place at this time and they weren't ready and on top of their game? Unacceptable.

It got worse when we were seated and the server ADRIAN introduced himself. He treated my friends like they were trash because they were asking questions about the menu and he said directly, ""What, you don't know how this works? Have you never ate here before?"" ....No we haven't ate here before and we NEVER would again. He was IMPATIENT, RUDE, EMBARRASING, and ever other bad word I can think of. He ignored our table and didn't even come by to ask if our food was OK or anything. He was sadly mistaken on his perception of my friends that we didn't ""have money"" or ""weren't his preferred client."" I am embarrassed I took my friends there. Let me just say it was the worst $380.00 food bill I have ever encountered. BIG WASTE OF MONEY.

HORRIBLE SERVICE. Paul you should be ashamed you support someone like this. He's ruining your hard earned name.",1
9291,This food is terrible. I ordered the Pad Thai with Chicken and it smelled not only of fish but it tasted like it too. I could only pick at it and that was about it. My friend ordered the katsu chicken and it was a rip off. The chicken was cut super thin and super small. Very disappointing. The dumplings were terrible. They were hardly cooked and tasted like the dough was only half cooked. If we weren't so hungry we would not have ate them. It took 9 minutes to get our tab after we gave the waitress our card. Not impressed with this place.,1
9292,"Oh Wow - SO yummy. This place is quite packed for lunch, but totally worth the wait. Wonderfully prepared pho with tons of meaty/veggie flavor. The extra basil and toppings were so fresh. We also enjoyed the fresh spring rolls. Yum - I  cannot wait to drop in again.",5
9295,I think it is ridiculous that there are so many bad reviews. Ive lived here for a few months and I have yet to have a problem. When I first moved in there were a few things that needed to be fixed and AS SOON AS i put in the order they were out there the following day. My neighbors are quite except my upstairs neighbor. I think she is an elephant with cement flipflops (but thats not the apartments fault) The office is open extended hours and they have a convenient online portal for paying rent and putting in maintenance requests. Also instead of Fedex or UPS delivering packages to your doors the office expects them and holds them for you and even sends you a notification. Which some apartments will not even take the package for you. If you are looking for a nice apartment complex with a cute little dog park this is it. Ignore the people that obviously are upset at the apartment complex for things they cant always control. People usually only review when they are upset.  Also PS the photos that people post below.... how the hell is the office supposed to STOP someone from double parking lol like there is a parking lot monitor? All they can do is correct the issue once they are notified.,5

9300,"We kept hearing about Babycakes from our friends that live out around Summerlin or Lower Utah area LOL and because of the distance we put them off. But, we were around the area running errands and found some time to see what everyone was hooting and hollering about. I'm glad we did.

We walked in around 11:30 and it was semi crowded. We got seated quickly and service was quick. Right away someone took our drink order and also brought our daughter a kids menu and crayons (that was very important). My daughter also noticed the decor, especially the 2 huge butterflies on each side of the beautiful flat screen that was on ESPN. I really liked that decor...not the butterflies but the ESPN. They also put up the kids Babycakes menu colorings all around the restaurants. You can also see the cooking area, it is small but they churn out ONO grindz!

This was our 1st time but we've heard enough through our friends and  Yelpizzles on what we should try. My wife ordered the Cowboy omelette which was pretty big and ordered their new Rock Road Pancakes. I ordered the Kalua Pig benedict.

~RR pancakes. Our kids loved it and what kid wouldn't. The chocolate pancakes were fluffy and loaded with mini marshmallows, choco syrup, slivered almonds, and topped with whipped cream. They also have other pancakes which you can get in full or short stacks. ( we'll try these next time)
-Red Velvet
-S'Mores
-PB & Jelly
-Lemon Ricotta
-Carrot Cake
-Bacon Pancakes
-Whole Wheat

~Cowboy omelette-  For $9.95 she got good size 4 egg omelette with ham, peppers, onions, mushrooms and cheddar cheese. And you can get either toast or get 3 buttermilk pancakes. You can also upgrade the pancakes to any of the above.

~Kalua Pig Benedict was really good. I've had this before at other restaurants and they get thumbs down, but Babycakes does it right. The Kalua Pig-shredded pork has a nice smokey flavor and not too salty is served on a toasted English muffin, topped w poached eggs, and a nice hollandaise sauce (they don't slather it on...It was just on the eggs). They also put a bit of sauteed cabbage on the tender Kalua pig which added a nice crunch. You might think to yourself ""Why cabbage?"" In Hawaii we grew up eating a dish called Kalua Pig and Cabbage, it was an easy and delicious home cooked meal. This a favorite in my book.

I saw the person next to me order the Loco Moco and i wanted to reach over and snake a bite from him. But, my wife said don't do it. This will be my next choice.

Babycakes is worth the drive and the wait. We've been here once and it won't be our last. But, we do have a message to Babycakes owners....Babycakes please make your way to GVR area...PLEASE!!

I have called on several different days and still no person. After reading all the reviews, which are much more bad then good, I decided to cancel my reservation on my booking day. I booked with Enterprise which cost a little more but it's completely worth not having to hassle to get a rental. They also don't make you purchase insurance if you don't want to and they don't require ridiculous things like Ace does. Don't waste your time and money on ACE!!!

9310,"This korean bbq place is a unique experience.  From when you walk in, the dishes that are served, the pull down hood system, and the staff, it was a great experience.  

We were seating and the coals were on.  Shortly after, traditional korean appetizers/side dishes were served, except there were a few that I haven't seen in most korean places, such as the bean sprouts and green onion salad (yum).  Also, Hobak has their own sauce that includes onions and jalapenos.

This is not an all you can eat place, but that is more than okay.  Why?  Because you can actually take what you didn't finish home!  I was super stuffed!

My bro and I got the beef combo.  This comes with beef brisket, angus boneless short ribs, Hobak marinated skirt steak, bean paste stew, steamed, egg, and rice pop ice cream. 

The servers cook for you!  Which is great because they did a better job cooking than I usually do.  We started with the brisket on the grill.  The server brought some sushi rice with a piece of wasabi in the middle.  When the brisket was done, he took a piece of the brisket, put it on top of the sushi rice, told me to dip it with their Hobak sauce, and I had a few more of those after!  The brisket with the wasabi, sushi rice, and Hobak sauce was amazing!

After the brisket was done, our server changed our grill, and it was on to the mesh grill.  Again, I'm glad he's cooking because I wouldn't how to handle cooking on this mesh grill.  Especially when I watched him cook our food, the fire was blazing!  After he cooked both sides, he sliced the big slab of meat to many pieces.  Great with the Hobak sauce or the side of salt and sesame oil.  

The Hobak marinated skirt steak was the best!  No need for sauces for that!  We were getting stuffed at that point and had a bunch of leftovers, so we got those to go.  

Mix the steam egg with rice, and you got a great combo.  I couldn't get enough of the bean paste stew.  It was spicy and full of great flavor.

At this point I was so stuffed, but I somehow always have room for desert.  We got the rice pop green tea ice cream.  It was very easy to eat ice cream sandwich.  An ice cream sandwich where the rice pop outer layer tastes like a waffle cone.  Again I was stuffed, but it was so good, I devoured the whole thing.",5
9311,"Do not fill up on the bread and butter. Strongly recommend the steak tartare, and the foie gras is a must. My wife and I split those two dishes and we both left uncomfortably full. Wait staff is very helpful and made excellent wine pairing suggestions from their extensive wine list.",5

9329,"We came here as table of 13 on a Sunday night. We were given a room at the back which was nice.

My initial reaction was that the plates and bowls were very dirty. There were food remnants on almost everything and several wine glasses had lipstick on it.

Our first few dishes came back to back and were decent. We changed our fish dish to deep fried fish and filets.
It arrived overcooked and cold.. Quite a disappointment.

The break between our main courses and the rice/noodles was a 50minute wait and we had to remind them we were still waiting on it. Our server was not even aware we had both rice and noodles.. We had to pull out the menu and show her.

Another main issue aside from the cleanliness is that there were many, many fruit flies/tiny mosquitoes that were hovering our table the entire night. I could point out at least 5 at one time.. Literally gave me goosebumps.

We also added two order of sweet and sour pork on top of our set menu meal at the beginning but this never came.. Their loss. 

Overall our server for the night was quite attentive but sad to say I will not be coming back.",1
9331,"I'm moved from LA to Las Vegas and convinced myself I needed a dog. My last bulldog past away in march 2014, so I had forgotten what it was to have a puppy. Getting off of work early in the morning and coming home wanting to just pass out. I had d'nero (my new bully) waking up ready to play. It was upsetting not getting enough sleep and him wanting to play. I finally found LUXE which honestly saved me from getting a second dog to play and my beauty sleep. Zaneta and Bobby are amazing, their love for animals really shows. If it was just a number count it would be like 90% of the PET KENNELS (which is what they should name their place instead of dog hotels) that have your dogs locked up all day and only being taken out to do their 1or 2.  They have like home style rooms for each dog when staying over, massage tables, treadmills for two buddy's to exercise side by side, indoor play area with clear glass rooms (20 kennels circling the play area)  for the dogs that just like to watch, outdoor play area dividing  big/small, I'm sure I've missed a lot. But honestly if your schedule is busy and want an awesome place to send your dog which he's sure to come home ready to cuddle. Their is no better place than this

After speaking to the young lady on the phone at the front desk she explained to me that she was booked solid for the day but she would speak to the doctor and see if you could get me in and much to my surprise she was able to do that... I took a cab over to Bella smiles where they saw me right away and were able to repair my tooth and avoid me from having a miserable vacation in Las Vegas... I can't praise the staff over there enough and Dr. Chawla for doing this awesome job for me without them I probably just would've packed my bags and headed home....,5
9335,"My favourite restaurant in Toronto so far.  I love everything about this place, from the ambiance, to the food, to the service.  As has been mentioned before, remember to bring cash since they do not accept any other form of payment.

I came here with an old friend of mine and his wife, who were in town for the weekend.  They live in New York and are used to eating at some of the finest places.  Suffice it to say that they were suitably impressed as well.

The charcuterie platter was the best I've had, and the bone marrow simply delicious.  Unfortunately, my friends were not up to trying the raw horse meat, so that will have to wait for another time.

The service was outstanding.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable, recommended an excellent wine, and was attentive to all our needs.  The meal was utterly delicious and totally reasonable in terms of price.  I can't wait to go back, but this is the kind of place that is so special that I don't want to ""kill"" it and will wait until I have other friends from out of town.",5

9349,"This has got to be the worst Chinese food in the city.
Maybe we didn't order right. Maybe only the ""actual"" Chinese dishes are good, because one thing is for sure: If you are looking for Ginger Beef, STEER CLEAR.
It seems, at some point, they must have changed their name, because this location and phone number is under the name of another restaurant on Yelp (Red House - http://www.yelp.ca/biz/red-house-family-restaurant-calgary) so I am posting this review twice.

The staff seemed friendly, but it was the basically inedible quality of the food that lands this restaurant on the bottom of the list.

I have never had Ginger Beef taste so bad. Not even from a mall. The meat was unbelievably tough (it actually seemed like WAY over-cooked pork), the ""fried"" outside was mushy and disgusting, and the flavour was completely flat. All around, just BAD.

9361,"This company truly deserves all 5 stars.  We hired Bob to oversee the remodeling of my mother's entire home, which turned out to be a large project. He was honest and professional from day one, proved himself many times to be worthy of our trust.  Bob showed up on time every time, and did a great job of communicating to us the work in progress via phone videos. He coordinated and managed his hand-picked team of specialists and the project was completed in a timely and professional manner. The job was done right, without cutting corners. It was as though he was remodeling his own home! I will absolutely call Bob with VETSBuilt for any future project.",5
9364,"Convinced my son to try a different sushi place and this place was highly recommended. Miso soup was lukewarm. Sushi was just bland. Spider roll was lacking the crab. Staff was super rude and not very attentive, had to ask for new sheets and for them to clear the dishes. Rather stick to other spots than return here",1
9366,Worst hospital I've ever been to in my life. The dr's in this hospital have absolutely no ethics and treat patients like they are not important if they have state health insurance. I would never allow anyone of my friends or family members to go to this hospital. I am currently suing this place for misdiagnoses and unethical practices.,1
9367,"When I do go to BE, I usually just sell because I have a lot of clothes and so little room. The staff is always friendly and greets you when you walk in. I've read the other reviews and will say they are looking for whats in style.  Regardless of what the brand is, if its not current style then they will not buy it. If you are selling, you need to think of the styles on the runway from this past spring fashion week, and see if you have anything in your wardrobe. For women's clothes think floral prints, gladiators(strappy sandals), high waisted jean shorts, boxy cropped tops,   MIDI dresses, trib printed clothing, etc. IF you have that type of style then there is a good chance they will purchase some of your items,and of course they will not take everything. They did purchase half of the items I brought in because it fits in the trendy area.",5
9368,"Service is absolutely horrible!!! I can't emphasize that enough. Like many Indian restaurants, the restaurant has lousy service and appears understaffed in my opinion. There was no hostess. We waited 10 minutes before anyone greeted us.  Once we were seated, no one greeted us and just kept passing by us. Yeah, I mean no one took our drink order. Finally, we had to flag a waiter and yell at them that no one even approached our table. Only then did they stop to even take an order. The water at the tables is lukewarm. The bottle they are in appeared dirty. For as nice as the restaurant appeared in terms of decor, they really should invest in a hostess and about 3 more waiters and teach them basic service etiquette.

The food is decent in my opinion. It's good but nothing noteworthy. I've had better Indian Chinese in other parts of the Valley. If the service was better, I would have considered back here. But with the lousy service, I don't recommend dining here. If you are go to dine, I recommend a few things. Bring bottles of cold water. Based on my experience, I think there is a good chance your water and drinks will not be refilled. Our water was never refilled, not once!! Also any drink they bring you will be served lukewarm. Asking for ice was like asking for gold; it's a rare commodity here in my opinion and when they brought ice in drinks, there was hardly any in the glass. Dress lightly and bring some hand held fans. The restaurant was very warm and the ventilation was poor imho. This was winter, I hate to imagine what it's like in the summer here. Arrive here with the mentality that you are in Russia circa 1980's. Expect long waits! Maybe have a few alcoholic drinks prior to arriving here to mellow you out cuz you will be frustrated.",1
9369,Karen and Sydney are my absolute favorites! I've been getting my nails done for many years and these two ladies are by far the best in the business. Sydney is detailed beyond belief with her pedicures. Karen gives the best facials ever!  Waxing my eyebrows are a breeze and I never have any breakouts or burns from the wax with Karen. I get more compliments on my nails than I ever have. They both will designs free hand that are out of this world!  Color choices are great too!,5

9377,"*ATTENTIONS**

First let me ask ""WHAT CAN U GET WITH $ 4.95 In Toronto?""
one large espresso from Starbucks? But u probably need more than one cup to make yourself high enough for work! Two TTC tickets? F*** them, they always let u wait forever! Maybe two cheese burger from McDonalds? Oh no, please, they just taste like freezer......
People, please just stop! let me tell you, with $4.95, you ain't get a shit here! u even cannot get in a cab! u even cannot get into Dance Cave without your student ID!
But now, there's place called El Furniture Warehouse is coming to your city, and your guys are damn lucky, because they sell all the food for $4.95! and they are f*** delicious!!!!! not just ""ok food"", I mean "" F*** Delicious!!!! If u don't know what ""delicious"" means, please don't comment or write review here! whatever you're vegan or a meat lover, you all can find your dish here, because they have tons of options on the food menu for your all. At this point, have to mention the burger there, swiss mushroom, veggie are the kill!!!! juicy and tasty! u even don't need dip source for fries, because when u eat your juicy burger, all the juice from the burger will dump onto fries, and please make sure u get extra napkin before you eat them, anyway, I can guarantee they will be best $5 burgers in your life! also the place get wicked in the night! great choice of music, no radio stations or top 50, DJ comes every night to turn the place on!
Nice environment, nice people and amazing food with great value.
So Torontonian, what are u still waiting for?
The legend is happening now, don't you want to be part of it?",5
9378,Me and my family used to go to this restaurant all the time in Scottsdale. And we loved it! You get free meals on your birthday. I'm not sure if they still do that... Bur the food and service was always great!. I have not been to jb's since the one in Scottsdale closed. But the next time i am in Phoenix i will check out the Phoenix location.,5

9382,"Deborah was so good & gracious! The ice storm impacted my travel plans and she was more worried about me & my dog staying safe than she was about being compensated for a cancellation - I offered, she declined. What a wonderful gesture!",5
9383,"My wife and I are creatures of comfort.  Our breakfast options usually consist of either Egg Works, Babystacks, or burritos at Roberto's.  We were out and about last weekend and had a hankering for some waffles.  Straight-forward enough, but surprisingly hard to find.  This place pops up on Yelp so we give it a go.

Daaaang.  The service was phenomenal.  Our waitress was on the ball, making sure our coffee was topped off and that we had anything we could possibly want.  The Lavazza coffee was ok, though not as mind-blowing as I would have thought from hearing people talk about it.  It's no Douwe Egberts, that's for sure.  My wife got the Nutella latte, which was ludicrously delicious.

The waffle and cinnamon french toast were fantastic.  Do not miss out on the pot of bread with a side of some outrageously addicting sugary dipping substance that should probably be outlawed.

I sure wish this place wasn't so far from where we are in Henderson.  It's a heck of a trek.  Also, be aware that this location does not feature all of the items pictured on the menu.  I would have loved to have tried the Oreo Butterscotch Pancakes, but that will require a trip to the other location.",5
9384,"BEWARE OF KEVIN KENDALL, Owner of Fearless Motorsports. I purchased a 2009 Dodge Journey SXT AWD paid in full. Kevin issues a verbal 100% guarantee on engine and transmission for 1 month or 1,500 Miles. Engine light comes on 25 miles after purchase. Kevin continues with lies, and more stories and made up figures of costs and his own spin on customer service which Kevin doesn't understand the concept. If Kevin's lips are moving then he's lying. Factual information. Car has a CARFAX report shows no accidents and mileage from 4 previous owners and shop repairs. Kevin reported this car with the exact mileage as from the time he purchased the vehicle at 121,489 and almost three months later during sale to me posted the mileage at 121,489. He reported the vehicle as a personal purchase yet sold it through Fearless Motorsports. Illegal, maybe? tax evasion, probably? Shady, DEFINITELY!! Took car to Auto body facility, Certified Mechanic states front end clearly in a minor to major collision with possible frame damage, easily verifiable with a replacement head lamp assembly with junkyard markings clearly written on the top of outer headlamp. When asking Kevin about headlamp being hazy, his response was it was buffing compound from the detailer and it'll come right off! After original purchase of almost $5800. cash, vehicle still cannot pass State of Nevada Emissions Laws and engine light still on. Kevin agreed to paying for repairs to fix emissions and catalytic converter. I had repairs done wholesale for just under $1000. total. Kevin says he called 2 fairy tale competitors and they quoted him over the phone of $330. Catalytic Converter alone was $590 wholesale and the labor is 4+ hours, plus (2) O2 sensors and a state certified mandated mechanic. Vehicle aslo needs:Brakes, rotors, hub replacement, motor mounts completely worn, bearings and shocks and struts are completely worn out. Does this make sense to you? Well it makes sense to him. So he offered an insulting $300 on his end on a vehicle that is under warranty. The warranty...Not an actual warranty but ""implied warranty!"" on contract before purchase. All of this will eventually end up in court, so... BEWARE, ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING KEVIN KENDALL SAYS OR DOES IS MOST LIKELY A LIE, HE IS AN OUT OF CONTROL CON-ARTIST SCAMMER THAT PROBABLY SHOULD GET ANGER MANAGEMENT COUNSELLING AS HE GETS RELEASED FROM A PRISON. Do yourself the biggest favor in the entire world. Run as fast and as far away as you can from KEVIN KENDALL and FEARLESS MOTORSPORTS LLC. Read all of the reviews and I bet you can spot the fake ones from the real ones. Also look at the business responses, all laughable and Kevin Kendall puts his own little spin on each and every one of them. While reading keep in mind the reviews are from honest people needing to buy a large purchase from someone they hope is honest and reputable. You can contact me, I'm real and I'm out almost $8,000 already! North Las Vegas Police Report, Better Business Bureau and the Arizona Attorney General have all the forwarded documents",1
9387,"Impeccable service. Pizzas are made the dominoes way, which when it's on point is pretty good. Had an order messed up once and within 24 hours was contacted by both corporate and the store owner to make it right.",5
9388,"We went here last night because we had previously enjoyed meals there.  However, last night was one of those experiences that you just recognize there will be no future meals there for us.
We were seated and ignored.  Waioters walked all areound us and were busy setting tables and other routine tsks rather than focused on the customers, us.  It was not crowded, yet the was no time to offer us drinks or ask our menu choice.
Very disappointing!",1
9389,"I have gone here two times. I thought the first was just a bad day..nope. Tried it again and the sound was so horrible. I have better sound at my apartment. The food is way over priced and the seating is so uncomfortable and weird. I paid money to sit in an office chair and have a desk with lights that dont to out distracting me the whole time. Speaking of distracting, the constant sound of people clinking their glasses and silverware is rather annoying. And it just so happens alot of elderly people go here and for some reason they like to talk and talk the whoooollllleee time, even after asking them to please be quiet(not the theatres fault I know) but its a reoccurring situation and I think they ahould have stricter rules on talking. So all in all I will NEVER go here again and would not recommend it unless you like to pay money for something you can do at home for free.",1
9390,"The food is really good! 

The eggplant is amazing, i didn't know that it could taste that good! The egg was perfectly cooked too, crunchy at the bottom and a runny yolk. I love this place! 

I also ordered sibangsilog, very tasty! I recommend it to all my friends..the price is also very reasonable and there was a tv to watch something while ur waiting or eatng.. 

Lastly, the turon dessert is amazeballs!!!! Ugh,,,",5

It is hard to find good shrimp and grits in the southwest at all, but Joe's was even better than some of the shrimp and grits I've had in the south. Be sure to save room for dessert, too. Their brownie sundae is amazing!",5
9393,"Our HOA has the cable service, which we cannot opt out of, so we gave Orbitel a try for internet service.  Over the last 3 years, we have had spotty service, and the price increases every year with no better service.  We subscribe to the 3Mbps service and get charged $34.95.  Really slow by todays standard, and a real rip off for the service.  Reliability is also a problem, at times off for 3 - 12 hours, with no warning, mostly we are told it's the equipment at the street.  We are shopping other choices now, and as soon as we can we will leave Orbitel.",1
9394,"Avoid, avoid, avoid!

We came to this place after seeing an ad for a meet and greet with UFC fighters. The ad also said to contact them for reservations. Naturally, we assumed this meant that to get to see the fighters you would need to be a patron, so we booked a reservation and showed up on time. The fighters, however, did not. They showed up an hour late. And when they did arrive, this place became a circus.

There was no organization whatsoever. We asked our waiter if it was possible to meet the fighters (as we were dining in the restaurant for that purpose) and he said ""they don't tell me anything about what's going on"" and walked away. When we got up and tried to get closer, we were told to ""get in line"" if we wanted a picture....so why did we make the reservation (as the ad suggested) and spend $$$ dining there if we're supposed to line up behind nearly 100 people who weren't patrons? Eventually, we did manage to get some pictures since the process was such a mess that they couldn't really stop anyone dining in the restaurant from doing so. 

But I feel really bad for the people who waited hours in line, most of whom were waiting in 40+ degree weather, to meet fighters that showed up an hour late + further delays because people that I assume are friends of the restaurant owners or something got to skip the line to meet the fighters.

To make matters worse, the burger I had was not cooked properly. I ordered it medium-well but received it well-done and charred. The fries were great - at least they have that going for them?

While I wanted to order dessert, the experience left such a poor taste in my mouth that I no longer wanted to contribute to these guys and will definitely avoid them in the future.",1
9396,"When looking for a new car it's hard to know who to trust, right?

That's how I felt.

Earnhardt Kia was the 3rd lot I visited in a two day period.   Needless to say the other two didn't get my business.  So I drove over 30 miles to check out Earnhardt Kia because of the reviews, quality of vehicles (and warranties!) and the fact they are part of the largest dealership in the state.  

Instead of being treated like a number, when I arrived at Earnhardt Kia, I was welcomed by Antwon Wallace, a transplant from their Las Vegas Store.

He was friendly and easy going.  I was apprehensive going into this experience because the other two dealerships.  So I told him right off the bat I was here to build credit and instead of the light leaving his eyes, he nodded his head and started showing me around BEFORE running my credit.  

I figured I was going to buy a used car, but when he heard I needed a big backseat for my kids' car seats, he told me he had kids too and said he wanted to try to get me into a new Sorento because of the rebates and warranties.

After going on a test drive... He talked to his boss and they worked out a deal for me that was waaaayyyy better than the deals I was offered at the other two stores (and one was an auto mall). 

And more than that I felt like I mattered.  I felt they made me a very fair offer and that Antwon was working FOR me. At one point the owner of the dealership came by and shook my hand and gave me his personal cell number and said to call him if I had any issues.  And when he told me how every one of his customers matter to him I truly felt he meant it! Amazing service all the way around!  Micheal, the business manager that set up the loan was great as well.  

It was an awesome experience!!  I highly recommend you check out Earnhardt Kia BEFORE going with another dealership.  They could be able to provide you better... better piece of mind, better service, and possibly a better deal, like they did for me!

I would call and ask for Antwon Wallace because he was the key for my awesome deal!! 

And the warranty they gave me is so sweet!  Mine includes free oil changes, detailing of the car and upkeep on the paint job by spraying a gloss coat on my car regularly.  Can you believe it?! Yup all included!!

You gotta check them out, remember to ask for Antwon, because the right sale person can always make you the right deal!!

Happy car shopping,

9401,"I found this place off Living Social. I'm so glad I did. I purchased 2 massages for my mom and I. The appt. was super easy to make and they really accommodated to our schedules. Once we arrived there ( about 15 mins early) they had us fill out some paper work, the therapists arrived, and we got right in. The massages were awesome. I had a woman named Amy. She was great!!!!!! I highly highly recommend her. She doesn't sit there and chit chat, so you can actually relax and enjoy the session. Since this was from a chiropractors office, it was a little different of a massage. (not your massage envy type) I was having some back leg pain, and Amy really went out of her way to help with the pain and really worked that area. After my mom and I were done, they had mentioned purchasing a membership. Being as I live in Glendale, and this place is in Scottsdale, I just couldn't justify it, but they don't pressure you or make you feel like you just wasted their time by coming there. 
All in all, It was a great massage. Honestly, I'll def. go back there. My leg feels 1000 times better. I highly recommend Amy. She totally knows what she's doing, and she's so nice and professional!",5

Approached the hostess as to why I had not been served, was passed to a unnamed light skinned black person, dressed like a boss. Asked him why I have yet to be served in a slow night. Said server busy recovering points and card from another customer. He made excuses, I asked for his boss. At this point in the middle of the restaurant he screamed that he was to call security on me. I walked out ...he stared me down, how embarrassing!!! Another person came up to me and made everything right. They still got my order worth after that.

I would highly recommend him to get your windshield replaced he has currently done two installs for me and will be doing two more. His prices are more then fair.  We have commercial insurance on our vehicles so we have to pay out-of-pocket for windshield replacement. And the price to install is very reasonable. He will also work with your insurance company if you have glass coverage. When we called our insurance company for our personal vehicle he was already in their system.  the lady from farmers had no problem with using him for the install.

Decent Japanese restaurants would put some grated daikon with grilled fish. Especially for these prices. Everything is so skimpy and jobs are sloppy. 

Service? You don't have to take your dishes from/to kitchen. That's all about it.

This place used to be filled with Japanese business persons after work and Japanese families. Not many Japanese customers now. No wonder.

You can taste the garlic and onions magically hidden and blended so well.",5
9426,"My group of friends came here during the Backstreet Boys on Saturday night. It was an absolute blast in VIP. They do mainly play 90s & hip hop, but the service was great and it was a fun environment. They let us ""check"" our vape pen and pick it up at the end of the night for $10. Great service since usually they make you take it back to your hotel or toss it at night clubs. 

Don't come here expecting it be XS, if that's your scene, go to XS. But if you are content with a step up from a blue martini vibe, this is a great intimate spot!! 

My only complaint is that our friend in the bachelorette party was pregnant and they wouldn't let us buy any other water than the $10 mini Fiji's. We were happy to pay for tap-water or a larger water, and they refused. They were the super small ones that the cocktail waitresses at nice casinos pass out for free for $10. We were going to buy a second bottle of vodka but decided to leave instead. The water thing sort of complicated things.",5

We ordered the mussel appetizer and it was well worth it. We enjoyed the staring biscuits too. 
We had the pork chop and the trout for our main course, cauliflower and the crab Mac and cheese. All were awesome but I do think there could be a bite or two more of crab in there. We concluded with a shared chocolatey coffee dessert. 
All on point and served beautifully.

During the summer months, my work schedule changes from five 8 hour days (manageable with dogs) to four 10 hour days. With a 30 minute commute each way and no break, that is just too long for my pups to be at home alone without a potty break! While looking for a low-cost solution such as doggie daycare or an in-home service, I stumbled across reviews for The Pudgy Pup. I noticed all of the positive reviews on Yelp and decided to check out their web site. I have to hand it to them--their rates are very reasonable. It would cost me $20 for the full day, per dog, or I could buy a package for multiple days at an even better rate. My dogs fit all of the criteria--they even require that dogs have their bordetella (kennel cough) vaccine. Did I mention Pudgy Pup is on my way to work AND open at 6 am? I work at 7 during the summer, how perfect... I thought to myself, okay, sign me up for the biggest package! But then I scrolled to the very bottom of the page, which they saw a fitting place to include their policy ""sorry, no pit bulls."" This place will never see one red cent of my money, and I will ensure that all of the dog people I know do the same. Pudgy Pup could have made lots of money off of my family this summer... but I guess they don't want it.",1
9441,This is one of the best places to go for happy hour! Especially for their all-day happy hour on Sundays. If you don't like sushi don't worry their menu has plenty of other options. I recommend the ribs and the sliders which are half off for happy hour! One of the reasons I love coming here is for their flavored sakis which are also on special for happy hour.,5
9443,"What a great place to eat!!! The owners/chefs are friendly and fantastic. The special for the day was a mountain of food for $5.00. We spent $43.00 for three people today and ended up taking more food home than we ate because the portions are so generous! 
   I've reviewed my share of smoked BBQ places in my current home town of Jacksonville FL and this is the standard by which I measure. For all of the BBQ restaurants that earned less than 5 stars: This is what you want your food to taste like!",5
9444,"Oh my god, this place, so cute, so good!

My bf and I were on a road trip, we were leaving Mesa to head toward Las Vegas. A solid brunch was definitely needed before the long drive. I found this spot on yelp, duh, and gave it a try.

Service: oookay, the girl at the front was a little impatient while we were trying to make up our minds about what to order, it was our first time there... Anyways, the spot is clean and modern looking. Great place to just sit and talk after brunch!

Food: delicious and fairly priced!

We ordered 2 bagels for the road and two bagel sandwiches to-go
-sunrise with meat: $4.99: good price, delicious, solid portion, BACON is life.
-lox sandwich $7.49: even though it is pricier, it has plenty of smoked salmon and onion, I liked it a looooot

My boyfriend devoured the 2 bagels and said they were delish! Hahaha
If I end up going to school in Mesa, this place will definitely be one of my frequent spots!",5
9446,"There is nothing better than having pastries at 5AM after coming back from the club. The new Jean Philippe at Aria looks better than the one in Bellagio, but the cream fountain in Bellagio is a nice touch.
I was tempted to try everything, so I got 6 cakes to my room and tried each one of them:)",5
9448,"I'm torn I really have liked this place since Native has opened. Over the last 4 months it has gone down hill. Dirty plates, crappy service. Having to check the bills for mystery items. Not even good enough to be called a good dive. Starting football season and now I'm searching for a new spot.",1

9450,"Hi ladies and gentlemen

I've been to this 99 Nails twice. The first time I went I went to have my eyebrows done I could feel where she was waxing and plucking and I immediately told her to stop I looked at my one eyebrow that she had already done and said forget it I'm out of here I had to wait for it to all grow back in. So I thought I won't go back for that. I took my daughter her friend and myself in for a pedicure in January of this year. I thought okay not great at eyebrows may be okay at pedicures. They said they could take all three of us at the same time which they lied and did not, by the time I figured out what was going on it was too late. As well she sprained my toe, burnt my feet with boiling hot water in the tub, when she was scrubbing my feet she got good skin and scraped me all to hell. I was talking to my daughter and all the sudden the bottom of my foot was on fire she was putting a hot rock on the bottom of my foot which burned it I told her to stop, and then she took an extremely hot towel and wrapped it in it which burned it even more. Several times they were hurting my daughter and her friend and I asked them to stop doing that  because it was hurting the girls  and they didn't listen so the girls were also in pain during and after their pedicures. And the topper ladies and gentlemen it was $75 bucks!!! I've been in the service industry and I know they rely on their tips, so I always try and leave something even if the service was subpar. Needless to say I left them NOTHING!!
And then I'm the one that felt guilty about not leaving them a tip lol!
I certainly hope this helps you out and gives you an idea what they're like  best of luck!",1
9452,"The bathrooms are ALWAYS filthy.  I went yesterday with my family and I was appalled how filthy it was. I took my two small children and left.  There was pee in the sinks, every toilet was clogged either with a dozen tampons and poop or just poop alone, wet toilet paper everywhere, there was balls of human hair on the floor everywhere (wet and dry hair), the amount of water on the floor was ridiculous also.  It was so flooded, like a mini swimming pool and I didn't know if it was from the toilets being clogged and flushed or from the water park itself.  The admission for this place is way too expensive ($40/per person) for the bathrooms to be this filthy.  They desperately need a bathroom attendant in that bathroom at all times. As for the water park the lazy river smelled like manure and the life jackets they have are disgusting and most are ripped.  (They don't let you bring in your own unless they are coast guard approved and I haven't found one yet for my young children every time I buy and bring one in they tell me I can't use it.) Also, I understand this place is outside but the amount of bugs crawling where the food comes from is ridiculous. Went to get a snow cone and walked away because there was ants and other little bugs crawling around inside where the guy was working.  This place is filthy!!  Save your money and go to Desert Breeze.  It's much cleaner and way cheaper.",1
9453,"I went through the drive up window and asked for a side of regular chips with my order, she said it is a extra charge, I knew there was and was fine with that. I get home and it looks like they took old chips and threw them back in the fryer and actually boxed them up extremely burnt, I don't mind dark chips but they were burnt. They also melted the plastic box they put them in. so now they are really not edible. I just don't understand why customer service is so poor. It would of taken 10 seconds to place them in a safe container and to give me fresh chips I could actually eat. A response back would be nice.",1

Staff member states u will be charged early termination fee for not giving 60 day notice. I explained that when u get a new job they never give u a 60 day notice of hire so how could I have know and my lease is almost up anyways. I was told you signed a contract that states 60 day notice required.

9478,"I was extremely disappointed with my visit back on 7/17/15. I came here with high expectations because of all the hype. The food and service was fantastic, up until an adolescent cockroach zoomed across our table during dessert. Our immediate reflex was to flick it off the table. We mentioned it to our waiter and didn't want to make a scene.

A few minutes later, another adolescent (if not the same one) cockroach sped on the table! This time, my boyfriend was quick to trap it with an empty wine glass. I waved down our waiter and he brought his manager over. The manager, Toshi, apologized and asked if he could get us free champagne. We said we didn't drink. He said sorry again, scooped the roach in the upside down wine glass along with a cloth napkin and walked away. Disgusting. No offer to comp our meal or credit to come back. It wasn't a cheap dinner. 

I wrote a letter to Caesars and they never even responded. Maybe now they'll listen..",1

Wouldn't recommend anyone else.",5

9485,"Just an awful restaurant. My order was incorrect and I was overcharged. So then after waiting forever in line I get to the window to find out I'm being charged for stuff I did not order! Geeze! It was so frustrating I had just gotten out if work and wanted to grab good and go home! So after trying to explain my order for the third time I was just fed up, so I told the guy that I didn't want anything that I would go somewhere else and proceeded to drive off. He sticks his head out of the window and yells ""NEXT TIME DONT SMOKE BEFORE YOU GO ORDER FOOD!"" Seriously the nerve! I had just worked a ten hour shift this guy was way out of line and highly unprofessional! Who hires these people!? I will never go back there, and with the service they provide I would not recommend anyone else to.",1
9486,"Disappointing.  A nice hotel with great ammenities.  HOWEVER, slow elevators, understaffed, poor service, and you do not get what you pay for. 

Moorea pool was a nice pool, however it took FOREVER to get drinks, food, salads, and it wasn't even a busy weekend.  Took a half hour to get salad dressing so i could eat my salad that got hot by the time it arrived...actually i had to find a manager to get it for me because my waiter never came back?  

I expect better service and better management solutions when things go wrong at a hotel.  When you pay top dollar for service, I expect to get it. The HOliday Inn Express has better service than this hotel.  

AFTER we checked out, 2 people in our party had to call back to fix their ""over charging"" at the pool and for the hotel room.  So, even more time wasted on the phone after we left to get that taken care of which still took several phone calls to get it resolved and waiting on hold for 30 minutes before someone would answer.

Overall, I would stay somewhere else.  

PS - when this hotel says that you are getting a King bed you are actually getting a Queen bed.  When they say you are getting a Queen bed, you are actually getting a double bed.  Not sure why they need to falsely advertise your bed size, but it does make a difference when you plan to have people share a double bed! Gets a little more cozy than desired.  The Palms Hotel does the same thing.  If the ""vegas standard"" is smaller than real life then why don't they just say it?",1

This location is in a very bad section of town. I was afraid to drive on to the lot!!  They DO NOT rent to anyone and everyone as their add claims. The ""man"" behind the counter was beyond rude, unprofessional and down right mean. He yelled at me to ""get out"" and wouldn't even deal with anyone in my rental party.

Heads up on this place. I specifically downloaded this app to make this review!

Well husband's got silverware with food still on it! Yes food still on the silverware!!

Carrying hot food over my 3 year olds head from the kitchen.
Tables aren't being bussed. Hell there's no bussers just 10-12 waiters.

9496,The best Mexican food I've had since moving to Vegas 8 years ago. The prices are very reasonable. The food takes longer because it is made as you order instead of just being re-heated and scooped on to a plate like a lot of greasy taco shops. This is an instant favorite because this place cooks real Mexican food the right way and isn't afraid to serve spicy salsa.,5

9499,"Spier and MacKay offers standout value.

My entire closet has morphed over the past few years and is now filled with S&M Shirts (except for a few shirts from Harry Rosen). I also have two of their suits, and one of their ties.

The company sources lots of high-quality fabrics (along with business staples, think linen, cotton-linen, madras, chambray, etc), and their business model allows you to get well-made, made to measure shirts for $60-120 Cdn. This includes shell buttons. Mother of pearl is an option, for a small upcharge. Their custom shirts  virtually unlimited customizations (like unfused collars), and relatively speedy delivery. Most of my orders have arrived within 4 weeks.

Suits are half-canvassed, well-cut, and come in two cuts. Contemporary is a shaped, but more roomy cut. Slim is great for people with a larger drop or guys who are lanky.

Custom suits are available, although I haven't tried that yet.

When a shirt order went sideways, they remade it immediately with no fuss. 

They're basically my go-to store now for shirts, and occasional suit. They will remain my go-to store until I can consistently afford to go bespoke.",5

But it looked good one day and I am sooo glad I had it. It is the best I have ever had. I had difficulty keeping conversation as I was too busy eating it! I don't remember if it was pricy as I was in food coma (they give you a lot) I am looking forward to maybe expanding my horizons. Their drinks are good too.. if you get that far!",5
9502,"This was the most disappointing meal I have had anywhere.  It took over 40 mins to get two three chicken tender meals.  They were out of coleslaw. The floor was sticky, staff seemed like they had no clue what they were doing.  I'm not even sure if what I wound up with could be called a chicken tender.  I have never in my life seen a chicken tender that was between 1/8"" and 1/16"" thick and looked it was run over by a steamroller, flat, thin and very dry. More like chicken leather. Wish I had asked for a refund.  I will never be back and will definitely tell all my friends not to visit this location - at least I hope it is only this location.",1

Food was meh, can't expect much from the after 10pm deal (used to be $10 after 10pm, now it's $13.99) but service was bad. They were rushing us to order because it was close to last call, alright we understand and ordered right away. Gave them a star for actually giving us our 8 portions of each meat/side dishes instead of cheating out. BUT we were constantly rushed to finish our food while there was 6 other tables just hanging around and when we finished, one of the ladies came to our table and say ""you have to get out now"". AND they included a 12% gratuity on our bill for a table of 4 people so be aware of that. 

Probably won't ever return again.",1

9514,"Although my time here was very brief, I have just recieved a fantastic first impression of this place! I stopped here because it was on the way home (quite close actually) and I needed gas. Their prices were lower than I saw at any other gas station driving home from 43rd and Peoria, so that says something. Their lot is very nice and spacious enough for me to easily drive around, and to find a pump. I had my niece and nephew in the car sleeping, so I did not want to wake them up just to go inside and pay for gas. I ran inside, and the cashier could tell that I was in a hurry, so he wasted no time in helping me. I ran back outside, and started pumping the gas, which was my favorite part.
At almost every other gas station, the gas pumps very slowly, and I have to wait forever out in the heat. Also, when it is close to the amount that you paid for, it slows down even more, and takes forever just to pump the last 50 cents! When I pumped at this QT, the ten dollars I put in pumped in less than 20 seconds, and didnt slow down at all. I was very impressed! When I got into the car, I could tell that this gas is better than anywhere else, because it filled my tank up higher than 10 dollars filled it up anywhere else! 
I also noticed from my short trip inside, that they take care of the place very nicely, because it is very clean. This location has impressed me immensely, and I will be back many more times to come!",5
9515,"Wow, blown away!  Our group of 13 intended to go the buffet at Caesar's but decided we didn't want to wait 2 hours.  We gave Joe's a call asked on a recommendation from one in our group.  They said they could take us right away, yay!

Our server, Daniel, is possible one of the best servers I've ever had.  Knowledgable, funny, efficient, and great at giving advice.  I originally decided on the stone crab given its in their name but he highly recommended the king crab. He made it sound so great I threw caution and my wallet in the wind and went for it!  Best decision ever.  The portion I ordered was a guaranteed minimum of 1 1/2 lbs but really it was more like 2 lbs!!!!  Even better, they crack it for you table side, such a cool presentation.  

You'll never have sweeter, plumper, or bigger pieces of king crab.  So worth it, thank you Daniel and Joe's!!!",5

I can't wait for the next time, I would love to try everything on their well built menu. This is exactly what Whitby needs as far as quality, class and creativity with menu options! Great job!

My cousin and I decided to split a few items so we could try as many things as possible. We started off with the deviled eggs, which were LOVELY, and super reasonably priced. Actually, back up. We started off with drinks. Duh. Who doesn't start with drinks at Bouchon? Who doesn't start with drinks in Vegas? Anyway, then we decided to split the endive salad with Roquefort. Glorious. For our entree, we had fish with potatoes that had a much fancier French name that I would never in a million years remember. The server expertly deboned it, which was pretty cool to watch. 

Our desserts were to die for...particularly the creme fraiche ice cream that came on the rhubarb tart. Our server was extremely professional and helpful when we were struggling to decide between entrees. The overall experience was fantastic, and matched my excellent experience at the Yountville Bouchon.",5

Before I go into the drink quality I want to make mention  that the girl making the drink put her hand along the rim of the cup... Regardless of what time of lid you put on the cup its not health code to do that. It irked me so bad, but I bit my tongue and waited for my beverage.

The drink was awful--flavorless not too mention the consistency was too thick,probably resulting from too much ice. The tapioca was warm... Never had that happen before, that was disgusting too. The beverage itself tasted grainy, which it never usually does at my regular bubble tea hotspot, Bubble Republic.

I came here based on a recommendation from a friend was thoroughly disappointed and cheesed that I spent money on such a disgusting drink. Never again I say! NEVER again!!!!",1

Pomo also has a cute bar,  and equally cute "" al fresco"" dining area .
They use really select fresh imported ingredients,  and cook the pizza in one helluva oven (950 degrees).
The meat and cheese plate paired with some great olives was delicious as was my mushroom soup.

Our table ordered 2 pies (sausage,mushroom,onion,peppers)(zucchini,peppers,¬≠egplant)

The pizza was simply outstanding, i allowed myself a slice ..and it was a slice of heaven Grilled zucchini,roasted red peppers ,eggplant. The presentation, aroma,  and taste was wonderful, the crust perfect !....This is PIZZA ..Italian pizza ! We all really enjoyed this pizza and cannot wait to try more from the menu.

A nod to the pastry chef ..for the fabu chocolate molten cake ( with gelato) Cannoli, and fig custard ..oh and the amaretto cookies .

Service was terrific!
solid menu! 
pure authentic ingredients,  and certified napoletana pizza = 5 solid stars!",5
9544,"I feel like I really need to update my review because the food & service here is just so good.
No, they still don't have my favorite fresh rolls, but truly everything here is simply exceptional. 
If you love Thia food, and are budget conscious - but not willing to compromise the quality of your eating, you should absolutely come to this family run, top quality, truly Thia restaurant.
If nothing else they are all just so kind you will leave feeling loved & apriciated. And who couldn't use more of that in their life?",5
9545,"We went to see Robin Thicke here 12/29 and was first time to see a show at Pearl though have been to Palms many times before. Purchased the least expensive seats in the balcony Section 303 and since the show (surprisingly as Robin's show is great but was not sold out) staff gave us better seats in same section stage center. This is a great venue to see shows as the view & acoustics are excellent. Staff friendly, look forward to see another show here again when there is an artist we want to see. Highly recommend.",5
9546,Deliciously friendly food! Strong coffee and large amount of food! Will definitely be back THIS WEEK!,5
9547,"Omgaaaaad the food here is the freakin bombbbbbbb. Came here with a friend and we only had to wait about 15 minutes (walk in, no reservation). We ordered 3 sushi rolls (spicy tuna, spicy scallop and some sort of house roll), all 3 were delicious. I ordered the sashimi dinner and the fish was extremely fresh. I still dream of the sushi I had from here. Definitely coming back when I have time. The plum wine is also great. Oh, and keep in mind that the restaurant it super small/cramped so bringing a big group here might not be the best idea.",5

My number one art store!",5

Great company!",5

Another lady (better speaking English one) came over and said they charge 10% because holiday on a ""Sunday."" 10% is not much money, but they tried to find any other excuse to charge extra. Good one, San Woo.",1
9561,"Honey, this place is worth every bit of dollar and cent you spend - which won't be many because the prices are great. Oh my goodness  it's amazing fresh street food in hip, restaurant format!
It's usually hard to find a seat - especially on a Friday night. I would suggest anything on the menu and make sure you get ROSADA sauce!! It's over on the side with all the other salsa's.
I love how they serve the tacos open-faced topped with cilantro and a lime wedge on the side (how do they know me so well?!)
My advice? Go there! Multiple times. 
They have good margaritas too. I was surprised by that. Thumbs up Sabor.",5
9562,"I wish I had read these reviews before I booked with Expedia. I booked for one night. Somehow the software glitched and charged me for 3 nights. I was promised a refund but they changed their minds. They charged $148 a night for a room the motel charged $89 for. The room was old, smelly and the key did not work. I was told to not lock the door if I had to leave.",1
9563,"My first complaint is the fact that they only have one register open with about 15+ people in line. My second complaint is how rude the employees are! A couple of weeks ago, I was shopping with my mom and my 8 month old niece, as we were standing in front of the line, my niece began choking and started to throw up. We received disgusted looks from the employees and my mom asked for somebody to come mop first letting them know my niece threw up. The lady looked at her, then the baby, then the throw up on the floor. My mom then asked for paper towels cleaning the mess herself since the employee didn't bother to call anybody, we weren't just going to leave it there! Somebody obviously could have slipped and fallen. The lady who handed her the towels looked at her with disgust and walked away from us. Now there are two employees working the registers, still nobody is helping us. One asks ""oh what happened?"" To the other employee and she responds ""the baby threw up I guess"" with disgust and they both stay behind the counter watching us clean up the mess holding up the line. I know baby throw up, throw up in general, isn't the greatest thing in the whole wide world but are you freaking serious?! SHES A BABY! She doesn't know any better! A little concern or help would be great next time!!! If you can go to any other vs store in Vegas, go there please. This place obviously does not care about their customers.",1
9565,"I've done my hair here for over a year with Blanca, yet never really complained because she WAS patient with my sensitive skin. I'm particularly talking about coloring my hair with bleach. If a tiny amount gets on my face, it would get red and irritated, then again, whose face wouldn't get irritated if bleach touches it? Over the year, I feel like she half ass her work and messes up because she overbooks herself. 
Yesterday was the second time in a row she messed up my hair. I asked for a touched up and toning and she left my hair super brassy and uneven. I was not satisfied with the service at all, I even point it out that it was brassy and she told me it was my fault for having sensitive skin so she couldn't leave the toner on longer than she wanted. It was $125 , of course I had to make sure I liked it. I came back a few hours later because I got super depress about my hair. I asked her nicely to fix it because I wasn't about to take work off the next day and will be gone for a month to California. She responded to me with an irritated tone and claimed it was the best she could've done. Which isn't true because she HAD done a decent job before. 
I left the shop in tears because I was devastated. I went to another person to fix my hair and he did an amazing job. Not to mention , he included oplex with his bleach to soften the hair. My hair was always fried when Blanca did it, yet again, never said anything. Yesterday was the day I had enough and decided to share my horrible experience. I even Facebook messaged her and showed her the brass in my hair but she ignored it. I appreciate her for being patient with my skin over the past year but I will never go back to her again after screwing my hair up and unwilling to compromise.",1
9566,"I have been going to Pita Jungle since their original location opened which is located on Apache Boulevard. I have never, ever had a bad meal there. Their servings are generous, the prices are very decent for the quality of the food and the freshness of it, and if you have not been there for happy hour which is incredibly inexpensive, you really should try. Almost all the plates are between 1 and $3 and three or four will be very filling. I go there at least once a month, and I cannot recommend the chicken shawarma pita sandwich enough. Staff is friendly and very attentive, and while the location is not perfect because you look at a parking lot or Southern Avenue if you're sitting outside, at least they do have comfortable outside seating with sprinklers in the summer and heaters in the winter. Overall, if you go there and have a bad meal, I would be incredibly surprised. The Ray Road location has an outside seating area which looks at the lake, and the inside is very pleasant as are all the staff. The only thing I am not crazy about with the Southern Avenue location is that it is quite noisy in there and the acoustics are not good, although they have placed soundproof boards around the walls to dampen the noise.",5
9567,"Looking for ""that"" spot where the moment you walk in, you fit in?  

Looking for a home cooked meal...without having to lift a finger? 

Looking for a place to pop a squat and shoot the shit?

Look no further than the Greenie!  

Breakfast, lunch, happy hour or dinner....it always fills the bill. 

Love taking the family there for weekend breakfast.  From the waffle sundae for my youngest to the seafood omelet for me...they have it all.  Huge portions...great prices! 

Swing in and ask for my favorite bartender, Joy to make you her ultimate bloody mary made with Effen Cucumber Vodka.  Yeah...she rocks it.  

It's all good...",5
9568,"I have been getting eyelash extensions for 2 1/2 years. I recently relocated and needed to find a new lash tech. I am so thankful I found Kevin! He does a fantastic job. The first time I saw him he explained to me that my lashes were damaged because my previous tech was using extensions that were too heavy. I had no idea that was happening. Kevin is very knowledgeable and I know I'm in excellent hands with him. He takes his time and my lashes look absolutely beautiful every time. Even after a couple of weeks when they start to fall out, they still look great. I go every 3 weeks and I couldn't be happier. Do yourself a favor and book an appointment with Kevin. You will be addicted.",5

9578,"This cozy little place is tucked inside the Smith's shopping center area on Rainbow and Windmill. At first it was hard to find since it is located in a small corner, but the ambiance was really nice. I've never been to a place like that before and although it is quite all on the inside it seems to be the place to go to for desserts and coffee. 

I am not an avid coffee drinker, but was able to try the pistachio latte which didn't have coffee in it and it was delicious. 

The honey toast smells so good as they are making it and tastes even better when it comes out. 

Was also able to try the Cookie Monster. This consisted of a Belgian waffle and Oreos with ice cream. This was also very yummy. 

Overall the place was very nice and the food was great.",5
9579,"Awesome place to get a cool and refreshing drinks during summer. Its located across from target on Silverado and Easter. The prices are very reasonable, except for addition charges for credit card use. 

I haven't eaten here, since I only get boba tea from this location. I usually get mango or avacado tea. They make drinks from fresh pieces of fruit/vegie and flavored powered, milk and ice. Drinks range from 3.50 to 5.50, based on size. It can easily replace one meal and its delicious, specially on hot days.

Also, they are now serving shaved ice. I need to try that soon and i'll update the review soon.",5
9580,"Terrible customer service from the start.  Wife ask to see if there is water available and I was immediately turned down for such standard request as quest here.  After few second I saw next front desk guy gave out 6 little bottle waters, it's an obvious discrimination and not acceptable .  I asked to see if I can drop off a package that already had shipping label printed out, and was turn away to bell service, then supervisor told me to go to front desk again, then another manager turn me down due to the service desk close at 6pm.  The whole incident and stay experience is just not delivered as a 4 star hotel should respond.  Definitely major turn off and no wonder the review gets worsen each year and I hope they enjoy losing another customer.  
Just to be fair, the room is clean, but hardware were outdated and took 5 sec for each channel to switch on their tv. shouldn't that be something very standard now days from any hotels in strip?  Clearly T.I. Needs help.",1

This is my go to place when i visit madison, my 2yr old has gone here since she was just under 1. The variety is what keeps her entertained. Everything is so crafty and abstract it is really nice for kids to explore this kind of environment. I also love the environment conciousness facility and the use of the roof in the summer ! Good authentic play :)",5

Came here twice, and started off on the V0s. I can do a V1 now maybe but will need some more practice. Great workout and social event location. The place is super clean and everyone who comes here are super friendly. One of the best places in Markham to spend a few hours with your friends.",5

The property is beautifully landscaped.  Wonderful clean pool.  The units have brand new upgraded appliances.  I like the awesome grills available.  All the neighbor tenants are very nice and friendly.  I can't help but leave a review here!  I have read the other comments on the Yelp blog.  There are people that left a less than perfect review some never even lived here.  I really like the web portal for handling rent payments, maintenance requests, and a community portal.  The nightly trash pick-up service makes very convenient and keeps the property clean.  I love the layouts of the units and look forward to meeting new neighbors that recognize the great value the Camden Montierra has to offer.",5

We waited 20 minutes in their drive through for them to charge us twice, once for our meal and second for someone else's meal because they said the transaction didn't go through. Then when we checked our bags they didn't give us the correct order. The burgers were cold and soggy like they were sitting in the bag for a while, the fries were wet, i dont wanna know why. And then when we called them to try and get our money back since we were charged twice it took a month to get a call back and they said we have to go in to the location to get our money back when we live 2 hours away from there. Theres other fast food in the area, avoid this wendy's.",1

Twice I was ignored, the third time I was told to come in for orientation, but the night before i was supposed show up, they called and said ""don't bother"".  What???  I'm done with this place in every regard.  I donate to other shelters that appreciate it.  When it comes time to adopt, it won't be from this place.  That makes me feel bad because the dogs deserve better, but dealing with this place is not something I care to do anymore.",1
9592,"This is our go to coffee shop. Amazing people, Fast service, great prices, and the Coffee is amazing.  They remember your name, interact w your kids, and really make it a great experience. My favorite is an iced cocomo or a nitro cold brew. Give ya some zoom for your day!",5

9594,Another great breakfast option in Vegas. I'd say it's more of a fancy traditional breakfast. We had the chicken fried steak which was big enough for 2 to share as well as the eggs Benedict and traditional breakfast. Everything was very tasty and delicious. You could tell the ingredients were very good. We got in pretty quick and the food was great. Definitely recommended!,5

9597,"I treated my mom and myself to Sea Pearl Facials, Bottoms Up Pedicures, and Luxury Manicures on April 1st, 2014, at the Spa. I have lived in the Ballantyne area for years; however, this was my first visit to the Spa at Ballantyne. Overall, we were very satisfied with every service we received. We were welcomed and had a full tour of the facilities upon arrival. 

I personally had Leigh for my facial, and she was amazing. She talked with me at length about my skin type, the products that would work well, and the experience was incredibly relaxing. I have had facials before, but this is the best one I've ever had. My mom was equally satisfied with her service, and said she could have stayed on the table forever. 

I had Choyoung for my bottoms up pedicure and luxury manicure. She was an expert, and sought to ensure comfort at every step! My mom and I had these together, and it was a great experience - relaxing, refreshing, and lots of good chatter. We had a beautiful view of the golf course, and were sipping complimentary Pomegranate Martinis during these services. I have not been doing a mani/pedi on a regular basis, but am considering adding this on a monthly basis. Choyoung was very welcoming, friendly, and efficient. 

The only part of our day that really irritated me was our checkout. After gathering our things from the locker room, we came back up to check out. My mother went into the shop to browse while I waited to pay. There was one customer at the desk actively engaged in a conversation with the man behind the desk. There was a woman behind the desk also, not participating in the discussion, but seemed like she was politely listening. 

She clearly saw us walk up, and my mother go into the shop. I stood there for a bit, expecting that since the other customer was actively engaged in conversation with the other staff member, she would respond but did not. I almost said 'excuse me', but given I do customer service for a living as well, I wanted to see how long she would ignore me. I continued to stand there, and finally she (Lindsey) greeted me. I must say she was the most cold and rude person I encountered at the Spa. She presented me with the itemized bill before charging my card with $700 in services and a forced 20% gratuity (I normally tip 20% and would have anyway, but it's nice for the customer to have that choice), and then focused back on the previous conversation while she was printing receipts. It was almost as if I was a bother to her. After I received my receipt, I started to walk into the shop, and I heard her greet the person behind me with a totally different attitude. 

After the fantastic service received from all of their services staff throughout the day, it was not something I expected at the end. It goes to show you that a borderline rude customer experience at the end can ruin the entire impression of a business. Additionally, I sent this feedback in e-mail to the Spa, and heard absolutely nothing from them...not even a 'sorry'.",1
9599,"As the Downtown Las Vegas dining scene continues to expand faster than Kirstie Alley's waistline, along comes Mundo. 

Located on the ground level of Word Market Center at one of the most architecturally interesting intersections in the valley, you will find Mundo-A Culinary Haute Spot. 

You will discover a hip dining area and bar that is tastefully decorated and (like the food) incorporates a fusion of influences. 

I think you could throw a dart at the menu, and be very pleased with what comes out of the kitchen. Think freshness, flair, and fab flavor. This is not you're mamacita's Mexican restaurant. Dishes that are ordinary at other Mexican eateries are extraordinary at Mundo. This is on the upper end of the pricing scale compared to most Mexican places, with most dinner entrees in the $20-$40 range-lunch $10-$20 (a la carte), but this is clearly more labor intensive food, prepared with soul, fusing fresh-top notch ingredients into a world of savory flavors.

9603,"Where do I start? I guess I'll start from the beginning. 

My husband and I stayed here the night before we departed for our honeymoon. The front desk staff was so nice and helpful. 

Once we finished the check in process which was super easy and NOT PAINFUL, we went up to our room and started to get comfortable. After about 15 minutes, we heard a knock on the door. It was the concierge with a bottle of champagne and gourmet chocolate cake and ice-cream. We were confused (yet excited) as to why they brought this to our room. We did not order it. They just wanted to congratulate us on our honeymoon! How thoughtful is that?! 

The food and champagne was so delicious and they really made us feel so valued and welcomed. I have never experienced that before (without having to pre-order).

Also, I'd like the driver, Carlos to get recognition. He was always on top of it. He got us to and from the airport on time and in style. When he picked us up from the airport, he even brought us refreshments. He was also very friendly, yet professional. If you're lucky enough to stay here, I hope you also get to experience Carlos. He's awesome!

9610,"I joined back in October with assurances that I could cancel anytime.  At the end of March I called to cancel because I was taking a work assignment out of state.  They sent me the cancellation paperwork with instructions to drop it off at the Carefree location which I did on April 4th.  They told me it would take about 10 days to process.  Being very busy I haven't done a good job of checking my credit card transactions.  Imagine my surprise when I saw THREE charges for $65 on my credit card dated April 17, May 17 and June 17!!!  I called the office expecting it was just an oversight but was told ""per the terms of agreement"" that I could not cancel!  First of all, that is not what I was told when I signed up and nothing was said when I processed the paperwork.  Then I was told that the general manager left a voice mail for me April 6th about the cancellation.  I never got any voicemail.  The proper way to communicate on matters such as these is email where you can document the interaction.  Such an underhanded scam.  I am out $200 because of these money grubbing crooks but I will take some satisfaction in warning others not to enter the membership agreement!",1

Tip: check out their website to order for pickup! They seem to prioritize pickup orders over in-person orders. I dropped by during lunch time (12pm), and though it wasn't busy inside, it took 30min for my order to be made due to many people dropping in to pick up their food.

For appetizers  we have ordered the taboli salad which had just the right flavors, and the humus served with warm pita which is out of this world.  Ask for more pita you're going to need it.  We also have had the lentil soup and the barley soup.  The soups were warm with flavors and very delicious.   The apps and soups were amazingly priced.  
For the main course we had the Bakhtiari kabobs with rice.  The meat was so tender and full of flavor and very filling.  The rice perfectly done.  We also have had the beef koobidah and that was seasoned nicely as well.  The gheymeh stew was amazing.  The meat tender and falling apart.  It was a warm comfort dish.

But, my nephew got the triple latte, I think it's vanilla, caramel and mocha, I can't exactly remember, but it tasted like heaven and unicorn tears. Honestly, I think little cherubs were flying around sprinkling love and magic in it. It's sooooo good. You must try it.",5
9645,"Where do I start??? My boyfriend LOVESS PIZZA! He has been wanting to take me here everytime I'm in town, he finally got the chance to.  I got the Garlic Puree as my base and when I tell you that was the best pizza ever. Can't wait to come again.",5

9647,"Best little cafe near Rio Vista community park! We stop here for breakfast after riding the trails just down the street. If you work out at the center or ride the many miles of trails at Rio Vista, this is a great place to stop and get a bite to eat, especially breakfast.

It's a small place tucked between the medical buildings in Sun City on 94th Drive just south of Thunderbird Blvd. Yes most of the clientele are seniors, so you know the prices are excellent! But the staff is always nice, the place is clean and the food is always good! Check hours, especially during the summer.",5
9648,"NJ native here, always looking for a good fold-able slice of pie and I saw Yelp loves this new place so I though I would give it a try....but when specifically looking for it it was very difficult to find.  It's on the east side (closer to loop 101) of the parking lot with Home Depot.

Upon entering I was greeted promptly and noticed a very fine selection of slices even though I came in at 3pm.  Got the 2 slices plus a drink special for around $6.  Mushroom pepperoni was my first pic.  A lot of cheese, fantastic fold-ability and the crust.  Molto Bene! 

***FUN FACT*** the reason we fold slices back East is because you won't burn your tongue or roof of your mouth with bread on both sides. (picture the 'more you know' cartoon from NBC)",5

9652,The food and service is great!  Lots of interesting choices.  The manager is always there and checking to make sure that everything that we ordered is to our liking and thanks us for coming in.  The wait staff is great about listening to what our allergies are and makes sure our meal comes the way we ordered it!,5
9653,"I have been to a lot of sports bars but none of them could prepare me for the amazing experience I had at Taco Mac. 

When you walk in you first see there are plenty of nice hd tvs all hung around the place which is great for a game day. The most amazing visual is when I laid my eyes on the over 100 beers on tap!!! From local to nationwide their selection is unmatched from every nearby bar. 

The food is what you'd expect from any sports bars. Burgers, wings etc. The food is nothing really special but it's all done well. 


Ian the manager who was working this night was the nicest most pleasurable manager I've ever met.",5
9655,"Absolutely outstanding location! Ordered the Hard Hat meal for 12-20 ppl through the drive through. Of course I expected to wait, but before they asked me to pull around and wait, the manager offered me and my husband free drinks while we waited an extra few minutes. After waiting about 10 mins (again it's a semi large order so I'm not impatiently waiting), the manager brings out our almost $100 meal and apologizes for the wait and gave us an extra side of chickens and canes sauces. THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Thank you to the manager for setting the expectations for the staff so high! (I didn't get his name ).",5
9656,"I retired last year and fell in love with planting succulents.  I found Grow Something on Yelp and went there (the second time today).

I am very impressed by the passion of the owner and her willingness to share her knowledge.  Her plants are nice and comparatively inexpensive.

I look around in many flower shops and big nurseries and find that this is really the best place to shop for succulents.  You won't feel disappoint.",5
9657,"Been getting my nails done since I was 16. I'm 29 now. I know what is what and I've tried a lot of places in vegas. I always get gel.
I have a place I've gone to for 3 years. But a gal pal called one day to say she was stressed and wanted a pedicure to relax. I decided I'd go and try out this new place with her. It was great. Clean , modern and the pedicure was awesome! It was relaxing, she took her time messaging and doing all the luxuries...Not to mention they give u all the stuff they used on you to take home as a gift. (Nail file, buffer etc)

She also had her hand color changed while she did her pedicure. She loved it. It was mood changing polish. 

Fast forward a month later I decided I'd go back alone and get ANOTHER pedicure but also a gel fill on my hands. The girl offered me all the different types of pedicures and I decided on the second to most expensive one. A Step above the one I did last time. The pedicure lasted maybe 20 mins, it was totally rushed and not at all the experience of the first time.no massage or buffing of my ski and feet.  And I didn't get the little baggy with all my stuff they used on me... But I figured whatever she's prob superrrr busy and needs to rush for her next client. She does my fill for my nails, and I pick a color. I ask her 2x if that brand chips because I had a bad experience with one particular company and didn't want a repeat experience. She and the guy working next to her said no that brand doesn't chip. And how they agree that the brand I had a bad experience with is commonly complained about. But that I had nothing to worry about with this brand. So I went ahead with it. Nails came out nice but nothing special. Total price for that days services, $108. 
Less than 24hours later one ENTIRE nail gel peels off. In one chunk. 2 days later 2 more peel and chip off at the sides and tip. So I called and asked if they had a guarantee on their services and they said yes if it's within the 7 days time. So I asked to come in that day and they said they were completely booked. So I scheduled a touch up for the following day, (7th day since the service). I arrive on time and pick a color from a different brand and I sit down and the receptionist who has been on the phone talking to her boyfriend about what to pick up for food for 10mins ignores me. I had to get her attention and ask to be helped. I'm told to wait because the girl who serviced me last time was finishing up her other client. I wait, and then when she's free I sit on her chair. She takes the color and starts writing a ticket to charge me $35. I asked her why I'm being charged if I'm there to fix the problem, with an attitude she tells me since it's not the same brand, it's considered a ""polish change"". I said no sorry I'm not paying for it. So she smugly says so u want the same color u did last time? I said no why would I want that if it didn't last? She says well that's the policy and u are suppose to come within the 7 days. I said ""I am here within the 7days"", with an attitude she says ""well you are here on the 7th day, so it's the end of the time"". Okkkkk.. But I am here within the 7days. If that's the rule why is this an issue? I said I didn't want the same polish and I wasn't paying for a new polish. That $108 a week ago was enough. She tears up the ticket and slams her drawer shut. She says ""I guess I won't charge you since your ""throwing a fit"". Mind u I've been calm and very respectful the whole time. She proceeds to do my nails and doesn't speak a word to me for 30+mins. Fine. The receptionist 45 mins later still on the SAME loud call fighting w her boyfriend about what and where to eat. My nail girl rolls her eyes and says that's a common thing and shakes her head. Anyways...I left there feeling embarrassed and shamed. I call my gal pal who introduced me to the place and tell her my story. She then tells me SHE too had her gel polish peel off within a few days. She thought maybe she'd done something wrong. And her brand was completely different than the 2 I tried. Within days my new ""polish change"" chipped and I had to go back to my reg place with my tail between my legs and get my usual girl to fix me up.

After coming on here I notice at least 4 or 5 reviews complaining about the nail polish peeling off as well. So I know it's not something we did. 

I'll never go back and I'll never recommend them.",1

What's also amazing is their array of hot sauces they have for your extra condiment pleasure. The waitress brings them to your table, introduces each one and tells u what to expect as far as spice level. We didn't dare try the habanero since the one below that (the one recommended for the torta) was plenty spicy! 

Service is friendly and restaurant is clean! Loved it here.

In the meantime they couldn't tell me where my belongings were or when they would be delivered. They gave me false dates, spanning over three weeks until i eventually got the divers number. He promised Saturday and were delivered at 8 pm on a Monday night. their customer service was appalling. They were rude and their systems are Draconian. They can not get in touch with their internal departments to give you an answer where your stuff is. they're cowboys and I will b taking them to small claims court for this and writing to the BBB to make sure they pay for this. I had damaged possessions and they charge you for everything on the back end. This includes a truck to come down my street because apparently the police stopped them from coming down. He produced no ticket to verify this, however. Extra $200 after being 51 days with my belongings after the pick up date.

9669,"I'm so happy to finally have found a property in Vegas that I know my company will be using again, again, and again. The M is brand spanking new -- only opened a little over two months ago -- but wow, are they starting off strong! 

It's a beautiful resort with the most amazing staff ever, incredible catering, and all the luxuries of the Strip without actually being in the middle of all the filth. The M is about a 15 minute drive from the Strip, right down Las Vegas Blvd. They offer an hourly shuttle so you can go get your fix and retreat. 

I loved the view from the floor-to-ceiling windows in our room that showed the lit up view of the Strip from a distance and the M's killer pool. They have a big stage overlooking the pool area for concerts, and we lucked out to catch a reggae show there one night.

Can I say just one more time how much I loooooved the staff at this place? Don't let the front desk people deter you (they're still working on stepping up their game), every single person in this hotel will do backflips to make sure you're having the best time ever. 

Highly recommend checking out: the pool, casino (great raffle giveaways!! they were giving out Lexuses last week!), the ginormous buffet at Studio B, the luxurious spa, and the super cool wine tasting bar. Oh yeah, and their room service is delish & inexpensive. Couldn't be better!!",5

9674,"Edit (5/3/13) - My fiance's screen went out again randomly today. She ended up taking it to a phone repair place near Old Town and according to that store the company that installed the screen (Inspect-Ur Gadget) did a shoddy job and didn't install the screen properly. Luckily it was a quick fix but it also cost us $45 for something this stupid business messed up on again. 

Seriously if your reading these reviews, go elsewhere. Quick Fix Cellular is good option for the East Valley.


I had high hopes for this place. I really did! I bookmarked them on Yelp after finding out that such a service existed right down the road from me. Now if your considering using them I have some words of advice right up front:

1. Use these guys if you can stand to be without your phone for possibly several days. 
2. Use them if live close by, or don't mind driving out to Val Vista/Warner Rd multiple times. 
3. If you can't be without your phone for more than a day, use them if you are prepared to zip over to their store for their 10 am opening at a moments notice. 

If you can't stomach any of the above warnings, don't buy their groupon or use their service. 

First of all, they need to stop doing Groupon. I live in Scottsdale now, in order to get same day service and not be without a phone for more than a day, I had to drive out there with my Groupon in hand and then they said they will call me when the parts arrive for the phone. Why can't I email them my Groupon? Or call them with my Groupon number? Why make it so difficult?? 

Then about 2 weeks later I finally call them asking what the status is, they said the parts arrived today and I can come in tomorrow. So the next day I arrive at 10:30 and they said it will be 3 hours. Bring a book or a laptop because you're stuck in this side of town. Luckily I had errands in the East Valley so I knocked them out while waiting. 

Really funny thing is every time I come here to drop off the phone, they ask for a cell number to call me when it's ready. Not sure how many people have 2 phones but that can't be the case for most people! 

Got the phone back, looking as good as new but then over the next few days we notice the screen has a spot where it does not recognize touch. This is a big problem. I understand parts have defects, its why they say they have a warranty. Now I had to drive back out again. Well I called in advance, the guy said to come down at any time. Sounds suspicious based on what they told me before on their shortage of parts. 

This time I made sure to get there right at 10:00 am, the guy then tried to tell me it will be done by the end of the day. Hahahaha I didn't stand for that one bit, if it was not for my sternness I would have let these guys ruin my whole day. I got them to get it done in 3 hours, still too long in my opinion. 

One thing that really worried me is that the lobby was filled with other angry customers. That mixed with the Yelp reviews makes leaves me to say I will not be using their service again. I think this could be a great service if they mixed in a lot more customer service and focus on giving the customer a good experience and not how many repairs can they get through in a day. 

So to conclude, they get 2 stars since they did fix the problem with the phone no question.",1

We both ordered the Big Astor sandwich with a choice of a side, of course I had my sparkling lemonade which I was pleased to find out they kept on the menu ( Im not a big drinker so its nice to have a fun drink to order while the others have there cocktails).

9694,"Love the Bellagio, and, now, love Petrossian.  Piano bar and little in the way of cigarette smoke.  Nice, romantic setting foie date night.",5
9696,"Subpar restaurant that is empty for a reason. Be aware:

1. The Groupon is misleading and forces customers to order from a different section of the menu that's $8-10 more than the lunch specials for the exact same portions. This negates the Groupon discount entirely and I've found businesses have been resorting more and more to these shady tactics to use Groupon to draw customers in then skewering them with high costs or bizarre rules to compensate for the ""discount"" they're providing. This blindsided us when it was time to pay the bill.

2. The meat cutter had no gloves on while he was working the machine to cut the meat. There was a bucket of water by his feet and towel that he kept reaching into to wipe the counter. He went from bucket to the meat. 

3. Food is subpar. The meats and veggies are medium to low quality with an off color that you can see by viewing the photos in this Yelp entry.

4. Service was middle of the road and there was a language barrier. We had to repeat our order and clarify it multiple times. 

5. Portions are skimpy, you will leave hungry. Don't let the photos fool you-- the meat covers the plate but it's cut razor thin. Each slice is paper thin.

At nearly $30 per person this place is way overpriced for boiled meat, rice, and frozen vegetables. 

For excellent shabu, check out Yojie Japanese Fondue instead. Superior quality meat, better location, better interior, and better service for the exact same price.",1

Upon walking in, the hostess did not make eye contact and was completely rude. Im used to walking in and being greeted. ""Welcome to Montauk,"" nope, just ""how many?""

After hostess #1 returned from cleaning the table she told hostess #2 ""its done."" We were then walked to the table, our menus were placed on the table and off she walked.

This review is in regards to the amazing customer service we recieved by Kayla!!!
I Came with a friend that highly recommended the vegan burger here, so I had to try it.
First of all,  let me just say, Kayla went above and beyond and even exceeded our expectations.
We ordered drinks, my friend asked for something that wasn't normally offered and Kayla made it happen. It may not have been a big deal to her but the fact that she took a few extra moments of her time to do what she did, really spoke volumes to me and about her.
 I used to be a server and this would totally have been something I would have done!
She was so sweet and came back several times to make sure everything was okay.
The Vegan burger was delicious!! It wasn't dry at all. There was a vegan cheese on it that tasted great as well, and the size did not dissapoint. We ate it with fries and they had great flavor that complimented the meal. 
Yardhouse has always been a good choice for food or drinks. It had a been a while since I last ate here, but Kayla really shined yesterday and I thought I should take my own moment to make this review.

I interviewed and submitted my resume in some gross fascination with how the place looks inside. Disgusting re-enters my thoughts. This place looks like the Office Space movie with an exponent for sprawling obsolescence layers into AGed infrastructure.

The people I interviewed with were doltish, unattractive, boring and I would generally like to watch them do my laundry. In the process they will also write birthday cards to people I dislike who have died. I still have addresses of remaining survivors in the dreaded city of Cleveland where American Greetings was founded. The goofball that walked me through to my interview room had the clumsy pride to refer to desk spaces and team structure as 'pods'. This must have some resonance with flower pods and their rosebud logo. My only discovery and conclusion in the matter is that he was retarded.  

I understand a new building in Crocker Park is being constructed. The  longer sustainability of the company is questionable with building delays, uncertain corporate entity existence, and declining financials. They have a technology branch subsidiary with dubious name of American Greetings Interactive. Hope for the best  pod crew.",1

9738,"This place is very clean and the food is so good! I ordered the pork bun sliders, garlic fried rice with goat meat, and a couple of coconut mojitos!! The waiter was very nice and always asked if we needed anything.  I would definitely come back. This place also has a huge bar!!",5
9739,They have the best macaroni and cheese around! Usually I'm not too crazy of Mac n cheese but I could eat this for days. Its creamy and cheesy and has little bits of crisp baked parts. It's delicious.. A must try. Ribs were delicious and the mini donuts at the end were a cute touch.,5
9742,"Excellent food and lots of it! Most of the time, food quality suffers when so many options are available, but not at Green Forest. I loved the variety - everything from leg of lamb to bacon-wrapped turkey. The hot foods and salad bar were impressive too - lots of options and very clean.

The prices may seem a little higher than you're used to for a meal, but the amount and variety of food make it worth every penny!

Pro-tip: it's a little hard to find at night as it's in a small plaza without great signage...",5
9744,"Great, friendly quick service! Carpet looks really good they were able to get out a stain from a spilled beer no problem! Will be using company again!",5
9747,I can't say enough great things about Eyebrow Envy!  Susan is truley an artist and does such a wonderful job every time i go in!  Not only does she do a great job but she is a sweetheart!! I definitely recommend this place- i moved away from right across the street to Henderson and still make it in to see Susan to get my brows done...she is that good!!  Defintely worth it to go here!,5
9749,"Recently discovered Jamba Juice in the past couple months. I can't believe they've been around a long time and I've never stopped into one. This one is closest to work and I've been heading there for lunch for basically a meal replacement drink. I usually add whey protein to the berry workout. That's my fav!

The best part about this location is the customer service! All the employees seem to have a friendly face and attitude. Makes you feel good about picking their business to stop in and spend your money. Hey, why not? Someone is being nice to me while I'm spending my hard-earned moolah plus I get a yummy drink that substitutes as my meal. I don't have to pack a lunch and worry about refrigeration, etc. The Jamba Juice is refreshing, cool, and feels my tummy full of yummy goodness. Wow, the Pumpkin Smash lite was delish I might add. Perfect for Halloween season!

Yeah, the drinks are kind of spendy but IMHO, is it really different than those who choose to spend $5-$7 on a combo meal at a fast food restaurant or those who spend $5 or more per day on specialty coffee or tea drinks? This is healthier than most fast food deep fried or fatty options. However, you need to be careful of calories and sugar content in this drinks too but they offer light versions. There are pamphlets and nutrition information readily available in the store. If you have any questions or need to modify a drink, just ask! I'm sure they will try to accomodate you.

They offer grilled sandwiches now too. I haven't tried one yet but they smell yummy when I'm in the store. Next on the to-do list!

There are so many combinations of drinks here I don't think I'll get sick of trying new things for awhile. Plus, I don't have to wash the blender!! Ha, ha, hate doing that at home when I make smoothies. It's almost worth a couple of extra bucks not to have to deal with that hassle of taking the blender apart and putting it back together. Plus, having all the fresh or frozen ingredients on hand in the right combination. Much easier just to roll on into this fast and friendly Jamba Juice and get your juice fix or even your veggie fix if that's your thing!",5
9753,"Oyshi sushi came highly recommended from a buddy of mine back in Hawaii. He said the next time you're in Las Vegas you need to check out this place and that ""I'll thank him later!"" This place did not disappoint! This is hands-down now my favorite place for sushi here in Las Vegas!

There are ample parking in the strip mall. This is a very nice restaurant outside and inside. The restaurant is very elegant, spacious, with high ceilings. This location appears to be a new building so everything if fresh, new, clean ....

They have a very impressive array of sushi roll
selections from your basic sashimi and nigiri sushi to their hand rolls and ""signature"" hand rolls! If you love sushi, I highly recommend ordering their signature hand rolls and other hand rolls!! Most of these selections are very exotic and unique! Nice combination and mixing of ingredients! The hand rolls were my favorites here!

Service is exceptional! They kept coming to see how we were doing, as well as making sure our drinks were topped off or didn't run low.

The next time you're in Las Vegas, take a drive away from the strip for some really fine hand-crafted sushi!

Oh, and did I forget to mention? Its all you can see for about $35! Even better! Yummy!",5
9756,"I was arrested for speeding over 35 mph in a 65 mph zone. As an out of stater, I was frustrated to learn it is treated as a criminal speeding or class 3 misdemeanor in Arizona. 
After talking to a dozen of people and searching the Internet, my frustration only grew up.. 

I learned that if I pleaded guilty, the violation will go on my criminal record. 
Will it show up as a criminal speeding? Or a class 3 misdemeanor? Will it affect my employment? Those questions were not easy to answer.. In fact, I still don't know answers to them.. Even the lawyers I talked to weren't so sure with their answers.. it was one of these 
- It's just a moving violation, it will show up as that on your criminal record, shouldn't lead to any complications
- It's a moving violation but it is classified as a misdemeanor crime, it may cause you troubles but we don't know for sure
- We are not even sure if the criminal record will classify the type of misdemeanor, saying it was just excess speeding.

Here are other examples of misdemeanor crimes on Google: petty theft, prostitution, public intoxication, simple assault, trespass, vandalism, discharging a firearm within city limits.

I decided to mitigate my risks of future legal complications with that case and started looking for a lawyer.

I got to hear a lot different voices on the phone.. And I classified them as follows,
- Not interested in the case
- Not confident they could win the case
- Not capable of establishing the lawyer - client connection and making me believe that at least they will try to win the case

And then I heard one of the lawyers from Corso and Rhude. Energetic and confident voice told me that even though they cannot guarantee success, they will make sure they will do everything possible to drop the charges, and here's how..

He carefully collected some information about me, to represent ""a human being"" not ""a case"".
He told me, 'I just wanna make the prosecutor see you as a normal, law-abiding guy who made a mistake'. It was very reassuring.. He described in steps how it works and what are my options. He patiently answered all my questions and in the end of the call I had a piece of paper with a detailed plan. I knew exactly what they are going to do and that put my mind at ease. Even though they operate in Phoenix, I was told they established connections with prosecutors throughout the state. They know them, they talk to them, they do business with them and have a pretty good share of cases resolved in favor of their clients.

During an informal review of my case with the prosecutor, my lawyer was able to negotiate dropping of my charges to a civil infraction. He said his client was very determined in having the criminal charges dropped and he'd sure go ahead and stand the trial if it doesn't happen. Now, here's the trick.. prosecutors may work with hundreds of cases at the same time and they are interested to reach an agreement in the plea bargain phase. That means not going to trial. Nobody likes going to trial.. It just sometimes the stakes may be high and trial is your only viable option.

He kept pushing further to make her agree to dropping points of my driver record.
'No way this is gonna happen' was the answer - 'He was doing over 100'.

He comes back to me, tells me the story and gives me two options. Either accept the deal or go to trial. He recommended not to go to trial because we've got a pretty fair deal but it was up to me.

The thing here is that they wouldn't have charged me anything had I decided to go to trial. It's in their best interests to cut you a deal before the trial. So I could've but fighting in the trial just for the points on your driver record would be downright stupid and I'm pretty sure I would've loose.. If not the case, then the time and money.

Standard fee for my case was $2,000 to be paid in advance. I was able to negotiate it down to $1,800 even though $2,000 was a very fair price on the market at that time. 

This example of willing to negotiate coupled with the other examples above is the quintessence of being a good law firm.",5
9758,"We are very pleased with our sunscreens and screen doors from CC Sunscreens!  They are professional to work with, have excellent prices and have a high quality product.  We had 25 sunscreens and 2 screendoor coverings made two weeks ago to cover the windows on the South and West sides of our house.  We have noticed such a difference that I have already contacted CC about getting more sunscreens for our windows that face NorthWest.  They were on time for all appointments.  Their installers are friendly and professional and paid close attention to detail.

We have a large home and have suffered through high electricity bills for years.  I didn't think that sunscreens would make a difference because our house has dual pane low e windows.  We haven't received our utility bill yet, but I definitely feel a difference in the house.  There are areas that always felt warm and stuffy - our eating area has windows on three sides.  We had these covered and it now feels much more comfortable being in this area in the afternoon.  At the end of April, I was only turning the A/C on at night and I have noticed that at the end of the day,  the temp is about 4-5 degrees cooler than it was before we put the sun screens on.",5
9763,"Delicious burgers and milkshakes, friendly staff, AWESOME music selection (EDM lol). This place is a must-try!",5
9764,"Favorite restaurant in charlotte by far. Food is amazing. Best curries I have ever had.  Prices are extremely well prices. I've been to Thai basil and Thai taste, and they have nothing on this place. And this place is a quarter of the cost. Place is small giving it a cozy feel. You don't feel like you are eating at a chain like pf changs.",5
9767,"K Blossom is a great addition to the asian beauty stores in Las Vegas - in fact, it's probably my new favorite. I stopped in this evening with my husband and was very impressed!

The shop itself is cute, well lit and clean. As far as ambiance goes, this place has other K beauty stores in the valley soundly beat. No contest. They offer a selection of clothing and accessories, but it wasn't what I was shopping for, so this review is only for their cosmetics and skincare. 

The customer service was fantastic, the woman working behind the counter (wish I could remember her name) was so helpful without being pushy. She made easy conversation and recommended a few products that I already use (and really enjoy)! She was genuinely knowledgable about the products and offered great suggestions.

Their single sheet mask selection is very good, and the prices are reasonable. They are more than you would pay online, but it's worth it to find out if you like a sheet mask before you buy a box of ten of them online. They had face, neck, hand and lip masks, as well as the new Dr. Jart rubber masks, skinfood wash-off masks, etc. They also had a great selection of AB products that are popular in the US (Missha's First Treatment Essence, Dr. Jart's Ceramidin Cream, CosRX Low ph Cleanser, etc.) as well as a few products that I was told were popular in Korea that I hadn't heard of before! They had testers out for everything - so if you want to try out a cushion color, hand cream, etc. before buying, this is the place!

I purchased two sheetmasks and a package of CosRX hydrocolloid acne patches and received three samples (pretty great considering I only spent 12$). They also offer a free sheet mask with a 20$ order and check in, which is a great yelp check-in offer!",5
9768,I have stayed at the downtown grand 10 or more times. I have gambled almost exclusively there. I received offers for free rooms and consequently chose to stay and play there. I recently tried to redeem my free rooms for Nov and was told they were not honoring the offers they had sent out . I was offered no compromise and was told I could get a crumby discount of 149 a night as opposed to four free nights. The least they could have done was honor the offers they sent out and started new ones after they had expired . I spoke to casino host who offered no solution and said all the other hosts had left for other properties . The property has definitely struggled in many ways since opening . We overlooked many problems based on the fair comps . If those are gone there are other properties our money will be better spent . Such a disappointment.,1
9770,"Worst experience ever!!! Sign at the Drive Thru was not lit up so we went in only to wait 30 min in line. Did I mention we were the 2nd people in line. They ran out of almost everything by 6:30pm and when we showed our digital coupon to add 1pc to our 8pc meal, they said it had to be printed out!!! Had I known this, I could have driven home in the 30 min I was in line. Oh, and I'm still here waiting for my order. NEVER again.",1
9771,"This was a great experience I will make this my nail salon in Wexford. Went to a different salon last time not that great but ok, they were closed today so I tried Skyline way better service Ann did a fantastic job I highly recommend.",5
9773,Waited 20mins for a table. Waited 15mins for service and received none. Extremely rude and disappointed. I would totally avoid - why bother waiting if you're not going to receive any service (in a completely empty restaurant). Totally avoid.,1
9775,Okay seriously I'm an egg sandwich aficionado and I highly recommend you go here and eat their sandwich. You will not regret it. I asked for a little mayo on my sandwich and it was seriously divine. 7 dollars for an amazing sandwich is a steal. Stop reading this and go.,5
9776,Amazing burgers!!! Busy place but worth the wait for fresh food.  Will definitely be back.,5
9777,The server was very inattentive. It seemed like it was a bother to serve me. The reuben was soggy. I guess the cook didn't think to drain the sauerkraut. The french fries were just like the ones you find in your grocery's frozen food section. The catsup squeeze bottle was so filthy that I refused to use it.  There is no reason to go to this restaurant.,1
9779,"All week we've been buying donuts for my work as a treat for everyone working hard for the holidays. Today I picked up donuts from here and everyone loved them! Easily the favorite of all the places we've tried this week. 
Thank you Fractured Prune for the awesome donuts this morning!",5
9780,"I LOVE this place because I LOVE potatoes! My favorite combination is a giga size sweet potato mixed with BBQ & sour cream flavors together. So delicious! Also, great to get the Groupon if they have it available, so always check. The last one I purchased was a deal for 3 $5 worth each for less than $9 on groupon = saved even more money on delicious potatoes.",5
9781,Great coffee shop great atmosphere.  The drinks are perfect and the baked goodies are something you have to try.  Go here several times a week!,5
9782,"I'm a big fan of PF Chang's food, and when you combine it with this great location, you just can't lose.  We were there recently and apparently some beauty pageant was going on because about 50 women wearing sashes with state names walked by as we were eating.  Needless to say, all the guys around were gawking.  That aside, the food was great as usual.  I really like everything here, but the one thing that always stands out for me is the flourless chocolate dome.  Please, save room for dessert.",5
9783,"We ordered chicken tikka, chicken tikka masala (chef hot), rice and naan bread (with potatoes) and everything tasted amazing. Portions were perfect for the price. Our server was really nice. Very satisfied with our first visit and definitely plan to return!",5
9784,"What could have been a problem was promptly handled by their reservation agent Kay/Kayla? 

Making reservations through a third party can be problematic but since I had personally been to this hotel when it first opened and many times since I decided to actually stay here.  When I booked the Hotel online I noticed that many of the rooms had two small beds? This obviously would not work for a newly dating couple and Kay/Kayla took care of it very professionally.

The room itself was a tad dark and the bathroom is small but the location and vibe of the hotel make up for the shortcomings of its age.  Food is very good, service was great, and everyone was very accommodating during the entire stay.

Will stay here again,

Cheers",5
9785,"Time for an update.  I have bumped them up a star.  I really do like going here.  I'm still seeing Bonnie and she always 'gets' what I'm trying to do.

So far I've had haircuts, highlights and all over color.  I will say that the haircuts are very affordable..the coloring processes not so much.  I was shocked to pay 100 bucks for all over color.  It was very tempting to say eff it and go get the box dye.  Oh how I'm glad I didn't.  But I was tempted, not gonna lie.

I've also bought products there - one that didn't work out - and they were more then happy to exchange it.

The boutique is nice as well.

I purchased a three pack of a man/pedi, and two massages.  The manicure was lovely as was the pedicure.  I haven't done the massage yet.  Here's a tip:  Buy the three pack..it's a very good deal.  I wish they did that with hair services, but so far it's all face and body services.",5

9788,"Loved the pizza, and this charming little hole in the wall--warm and inviting. Looks like it's been there forever with its eclectic decor of film star memorabilia and intimate red and green lighting; yet, they've only been there 5 years!!  The pizza is above and beyond your every day pizza!  Service was friendly!  We also ordered the dinner salad with the homemade house dressing. Yum!  We marked this pizza place on our GPS as our new fave! We WILL be back soon!!!",5

He touched up my roots with great precision, getting close to the scalp, and weaving the blonde in so the grow out between appointments is barely noticeable. Matt also retaped my hair extensions so they stop falling out. My hair looked and felt glorious when I left. I am so blessed to have finally found the perfect stylist!",5

9794,"I've given this place plenty of chances, and I don't know what everyone is talking about.  It's awful.  My chicken satay, dry, dry, dry.  Cooked and reheated.  The papaya salad was tasteless and soggy.  The pad thai is terrible, too.   Never going back.",1
9795,"Found Jason's service through Yelp, did my research, and decided to trust him with my crew's New Year's weekend trip to Vegas. Jason was attentive, informative, and a pleasure to meet.

Always there when I had any question, I will definitely be going through Jason and Hotshotvegas again whenever I'm in Vegas.",5
9798,"Poor service, and it's basically Vons but way too expensive. $6 per POUND of chicken breast, seriously?!",1
9799,"Very good! After a long bus ride Ginkgo certainly hit the spot for some delicious brunch fare. The aesthetic is very nice and feels pretty hip, with high ceilings and careful decorations. My friend and I both opted for the Florentine eggs benedict which was basically an eggs Benedict with white cheddar and spinach. The breakfast potatoes were REALLY good. I am a bit of breakfast potato connoisseur, and these were delicious. Very crispy with green onions and maybe a squeeze of lemon. It also came with a fresh fruit salad and a coffee or tea. I did not know that it came with coffee or tea and had ordered a tea, and when we saw the price of the breakfast not including the tea we informed our waitress who informed us that it was included, which was a nice surprise! However, I think they should advertise this. The price was very reasonable, and came out to just over $15 with tax for quite a lot of food and a drink in a very aesthetically pleasing location. Would definitely go again.",5
9800,"I love the addition of this place to the downtown area. The food was very good and there were a lot of tasty options to chose from. I had a pasta dish and the pasta was perfectly hand made and tasted delicate and delicious. The drinks were crafty and very smooth. I will certainly be back and wouldn't decline an offer to eat here! It is a little noisy, but that is to be expected at most popular restaurants.",5
9801,"This coffee shop is amazing! It has a great atmosphere, the employees are friendly and the coffee is great! 
I got the chai latte with almond milk and I have to say it was the best chai I've had yet. The price was also very affordable.
I definitely plan to stop in every time I'm in the area!",5
9802,Went here tonight after a long day of moving. All I wanted was a cold craft beer and wings. They didn't disappoint. I got the garlic Parmesan wings and they were great. Also had a side salad and Some fries. I love the fact that you can get a nice salad for under $3.00. Most places want to charge you $8.00 for a little bowl of lettuce. Salad was served at room temperature.  I wasn't happy about that but oh well. Nobody is perfect.,5
9803,I took the Decorating for the Holidays class after purchasing the Groupon for it. I got to the class late due to freeway closures and was still greeted warmly. Anthony helped to catch me up and was there to help and give tips the whole time. Check this place out for your bakery needs!!! I loved it!!!!,5
9804,"I truly enjoyed my stay here. The accommodations were excellent. We had a nice view, free internet with free parking. Located at what I would call the heart of Vegas.We were able to walk right onto Fremont Street for the 'EXPERIENCE"". A must see! The buffet had everything anyone one would want. The shark tank awesome. I will be back.",5
9806,"This is the first time I have ever had my windows professionally cleaned and I have to say, I was deeply impressed.  I knew my windows were hazy and screens dirty but didn't realize just how dirty they were till they sparkled again.  Joel was our technician and he was very thorough and polite, wore booties inside and made sure I was happy before he left.  I would highly recommend FISH, the cost was very reasonable for the service provided. Robert",5

9809,"This place is KILLER GOOD. We have been eyeing this place for a few weeks now after moving right behind it. It's finally OPEN! They currently only have part of the menu available as it's a soft opening but we tried a little of everything, and it was all VERY GOOD! The owner said they anticipate having everything available very soon

Coleslaw- Good
Pulled Pork- Good
Smoked Chicken Breast - SOOO BIG and Good
Ribs- Good
Home Made Carolina Gold Sauce- Good
Mac & Cheese- Soooo GOOD OMG YUM 
Potato Salad- Good
Sweet Tea- Good
Key Lime Pie- Good
Corn Bread- Good

So as you can see... ITS ALL GOOD",5
9811,Very unimpressed with their falafel. Seemed more like hush puppies from a Long John Silvers.,1
9813,"Excellent customer service. The employee who helped us was full of enthusiasm and she knew the menu very well as I had asked her for recommendations. She gave us samples of the different flavors. She also took the time making sure that the product presentation was as good as it tasted. I am very excited to try this place again; especially when summer time comes. I highly recommend trying their Dole pineapple soft serve. I also tried their banana split with pineapple, mango, and strawberry.",5
9814,"I have wondered past this place a couple of times on my way home from work as I work at Queen's Park and live near Yonge/Bloor. I think the actual signage keeps people away from this restaurant. 

As Asahi Sushi near my house was closed, and Wow Sushi wasn't that great last time I was there, we decided to venture over to Bay Street. I can't state how happy I am that we did. There was only one other person inside this restaurant for lunch on a Saturday. Assumed the worst, but got the best. 

We both ordered combinations with sushi, sashimi and rolls. I can't emphasize enough how delicious the rolls are with some extra seasoning on them. The chef puts some definite love into his work. The fish were extremely fresh, the portion size was good. The salad and soup were good, they asked us if we wanted more. I LOVE THIS PLACE. It is a few dollars more, but this is my new go to spot and I will walk the extra 2 blocks from Asahi to go to this place from now on. 

If you are in the area and love sushi, definitely check this place out - even worth traveling to - yes I said it and I never say that. Only downside is that if the place was full, service could be slow???",5
9817,sandwich was amazing. The sicilian sandwich was higley recomended by co-workers and didn't dissapoint one bit,5
9818,I personally recommend Christine for all your design and decorating needs. I have seen her work and it is amazing! Christine manages to work with all lifestyle designs and budgets.,5
9819,"Favorite coffee shop in Phoenix right here. Where do I begin with my love for this place? Their iced toddy is mind-blowing. No coffee has ever jump started my day the way this stuff does. It is smooth, delicious and full of caffeination.

This place gets major brownie points for having almond milk. Thank God I don't have to ever have another latte with dairy or soy. Their iced chai with almond milk will change your life and it makes their toddy that much smoother.

Their food is delectable. They have Tammie Coe everything and if you haven't tried Tammie Coe cakes, you're missing out. I haven't tried a cupcake, muffin or breakfast sandwich I didn't like (make sure you try a breakfast croissant sandwich with turkey bacon. Earth shattering good.)

Last but definitely not least, their customer service is epic. I have the best convos with these guys and they're always ready to suggest good teas to match my mood or go above and beyond to make my drink perfect. They're like my neighborhood friends. What more could you ask for from a place? The owners of BCCH have done everything right!",5
9828,"Only giving it a 1 because you can't do zero.  We get there and they put my husband and 70 year old dad right in the middle of traffic.  In a very claustrophobic booth.  We ask to move after ordering our drinks.  Took 20 minutes to get our drinks even after we told both waitresses and the hostess helped us move.  Pops and I both ordered the 16oz prime rib so we could have leftovers for lunch the next day.   They bring out our prime ribs and say our baked potatoes are on the way.  Pictures attached.  Almost half of it was fat.  I said oh my gosh that's a lot of fat.  Waitress says nothing.   
Pops and my hubby ordered salads and I ordered mushrooms as my other side.   They bring my daughters and husbands meals came.  A few minutes later we get out baked potatoes.   Hubby says where is my potato?   Well they had given him my mushrooms and he was well on his way of eating them.   So you would think I'd get new mushrooms right?  Nope.  Just slide the half eaten mushrooms to my plate.   Then we order another round of drinks and it takes 20 minutes to get a half chill fireball shot.    
So not a good experience.  If I'm paying $25 for a 16oz prime rib, I should get ""close"" to 16oz.  Not 8oz of meat and 8oz of fat.   
Also it's supposed to be unlimited bread.  How many loaves do you think we got?  Yup 1.  
Not a happy experience.",1
9830,"Very nice, very professional- took 20-30 minutes- located in their home- nice neighborhood, clean.  Bring cash- takes his time to make it right. Highly recommend. Thank You Mr. & Mrs. William!",5
9832,"My first statement is that this is better than ice cream. I know that's a strong statement but my when I took my first bite of my rise and shine acai bowl, I was in heaven. This is exactly what I needed to cool off for summer. It's not overly sweet and creamy like ice cream and gelato, but has a refreshing and healthy taste. Not the bad kind of healthy taste but the good one. The taste that makes you want to eat healthy for every meal. 

At first I thought the price was a little high, but now I am more than happy to pay the price. It's a much healthier alternative to ice cream. I could honestly eat this for every meal of summer. Also, it is GMO free!

The rise and shine acai bowl with vitamin C is $8.52. The only thing that wasn't what I like was the mango because it was in chunks near the core. But I can just order it without the mango. 

100% recommend this place!",5
9833,"I approached the owner of the hostel with a request to shoot a scene in a movie at her location.  I was happily surprised when the owner replied with an immediate, ""Yes!""

I loved the look of the hostel, a unique venue to be sure.  They have an outdoor performance area, lots of native plants and an interior that speaks of the history of the hostel and the city itself.  

The staff at the hostel was very helpful, even staying late to assist us.  I've done my fair share of hosteling across Europe and the U.S., and this hostel is by far the most welcoming place I've encountered. If you are hosteling, you should come to Phoenix and stay here.  You'll love it!",5
9834,This is my go to nail salon now. The prices are reasonable and the service is amazing. My nails always look great and last quite a while- which is impressive for regular manicures withstanding my restaurant job. I really love the people here and highly recommend this to all my friends.,5

The place is pretty inside with an open kitchen. The service was great and our waitress was really friendly. I ordered the big salad and it was delicious! My friends ordered the pasta bolognese, yellow coconut curry, ravioli, and Oliva tapenade and they all really enjoyed them as well. One of my friends was never a huge fan of vegan foods, but really enjoyed her dish. I also ordered the eat your greens smoothie which was also tasty. I would definitely come here again.",5
9839,"Beautiful outside so we sat on the patio, very nice!  Calamari for an appetizer very well done.  Cod fish and mixed fries with real nice cole slaw with a pecan tapenade.  Ashley had the Louisiana Gumbo nicely flavored.  We'll be back here sometime.",5
9842,"Absolutely delicious, humanely raised eggs and bacon, real maple syrup, homemade bread, good coffee, and super fast delivery of our food to the table. What more could you want? Highly recommended!",5
9843,"What a disappointment. The drinks were average and that was the best part of the meal. The pub burger had no flavor except for the egg and you have two choices either medium or medium well. The Italian burger was no better, no flavor. Tomato bruschetta was just chopped cherry tomatoes, sad. The fries are cooked fast and sit on the counter while your burger cooks so they end up soggy and not hot anymore. Really, save your money and go to McDonald's, its better than Broadway Bad Burger Bar.",1
9846,Just because he's on tv doesn't make his restaurants good. Gross food at the linq in vegas!!! Nachos were stupid,1
9847,They have a delicious chai tea here - and lots of flavoring to choose from. I haven't tried their food items but what I saw come out looked good. Service is really great.,5
9848,"Wonderful breakfast place with delicious, unique dishes and great service. The savory crepes are amazing!!  I really can't say enough about them. The manager clearly cares about guests and makes sure they enjoy the meal. Good coffee, too!",5
9849,"OUT-FING-STANDING... No serious.. This neighborhood sports bar has an upscale natural wood interior with low lighting and enough flat screens to satisfy anyone. The staff is supper cool. Now the drinks are made to perfection and don't get me started on the food.. Ok I will start. This is NOT bar food; if you go out to eat BEFORE coming here for drinks then you just made a HUGE mistake. I had the pleasure of meeting the owner as my friend and I have become somewhat of regulars here.  They have a CHEF on staff (not a cook, a chef) and it shows. I have yet to have an average meal.

Honestly try the food and you don't HAVE to thank me afterwards unless you really want to.",5
9851,"I had used their service twice. Both times, the owner answered the phone and had fixed my A/C problems promptly. One of the visits was on Saturday! Highly recommend!",5
9854,"Didn't pick these guys - my home warranty company American Home Shield did. AHS has a history of sending very poor contractors and this was no exception. These guys were rude and unprofessional (they couldn't even close the door behind them and my cat almost got out several times). I submitted a ticket with three items. They claimed that all they had was one (but managed to check and see the 2nd issue wasn't covered???). They were very obviously looking to do as little work as possible. They were attempting to fix a light which was part of a ceiling fan assembly - in the process of fixing it, they discovered it had a feature that allowed it to operate with a remote control. They refused to fix it so that I could order a remote to operate it. As a new home owner who didn't get a remote when I moved in, how was I supposed to know it was remote control??? They demanded that I produce the remote control if I wanted that portion fixed, and without it they chose to bypass the capability and rip out the remote receiver. They told me if I wanted it fixed I would have to place another service call through the warranty company and pay another $60 deductible. Nice to know this trip cost me $60 and lost functionality of my light/fan.

Perhaps they were only operating under the guidelines that AHS sets - AHS is a horrible company to begin with (I'll save that story for another review)- but these guys were very unprofessional and rude in the way they dealt with the entire visit . As a home owner, I wouldn't dream of having them back when the choice is up to me. 

They also don't accept credit cards, with the repair man pointing out that they are too risky and insinuated that by expecting his company to take my credit card, I was somehow trying to rip him off.",1
9855,"Wow what a huge disappointment coming here was. The staff was good a we were seated quickly for a Friday night.  We have heard so much good we passed on Grimaldi's to come here.

- Ordered the Antipasto for $11, it was ok but not enough for 2 people. Pricey for little.
- Ordered Regina Margherita D.O.C this was just awful. This thing looked like it fell on the floor. 3 faint cheese spots with 3 basil leave mostly on 1 side and a cherry tomato not a San Marzano like advertised. The sauce was bland and tasted like tomato soup concentrate. $14 very pricey 

This with 2 glasses of wine costs me $60..Ouch.

For anyone who cooks or likes to eat you have to have passion and present your food as the best value, this was a meager attempt at that. Maybe this La Piazza has seen it's better days. I will never know as I won't return.",1
9856,"I have been going to this place for nearly a year and would never go anywhere else. I love the girls they're all really talented, it's always clean, and the prices are phenomenal considering the quality of work.

Sally runs the place like a well-oiled machine and she is fantastic at doing nails too!

I even moved 20 km away and STILL come uptown to get my nails done because I don't trust any other place!",5
9857,"The cake itself was not bad, and dealing with Lisa and Carolyn was pleasant, if not always timely or informative.
The cake was a massive disappointment.  
The writing on the cake was sketchy- like imagine is you tried to write with a paintbrush without practicing at all.
None of the corners on the patterned design lined up, incredibly.
There was a feature on the cake that was made out of something hard, but foam like- here they had cut it out wrong, and instead of redoing it, had just added another layer in spots, which was beyond obvious.
At first glance, it was exactly what I wanted.  Upon closer inspection it looked totally thrown together, without even the slightest hint of care. 
I'm so surprised to see all these rave reviews- maybe they threw my cake together since I was from out of town?  
I felt like a fool for spending so much money, and being so friendly with people who obviously did not care at all.",1
9858,"Came here with a group of 10 during our vegas trip to celebrate a couple of October birthdays. Me and three others shared the steak for 4 that came with two sides, we picked mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. Everythings tasted so yummy and the mac and cheese was pretty damn amazing. Some of the people in my group said it was the best mac and cheese they've ever had. I may have to agree, it was that good!

Hang around the casino before you eat here and you may find people giving out coupons for buy 1 get 1 free drinks for this place. We got lots of coupons and we were all able to use them.",5
9859,"I highly recommend, what us locals call: the GGB's. (Golden garlic butter wings). Best combo of flavors on your pallet as far as wings are concerned! 

The protein plate is also amazing, as the chicken is so juicy and cooked perfectly everytime! 

You must also try the cheese soup, with popcorn! What a culinary innovative way of serving an American favorite. You can definitely taste all the various cheeses and given that, I'd recommend sharing it, as it is thick and rich in flavor. The popcorn is an additional surprise! The chef takes his time, makes the sauces and soups from scratch, and that's unexpected for a small establishment. 

Free wi-fi too! Stop by and meet all the girls...they are super friendly!",5
9862,"Have taken my 2 small dogs, Monkey and Kennedy, there twice and already have 2 more reservations lined up. Friendly staff members make the process easy to drop off/pick up/make reservations. Also, you get a confirmation call prior to ensure your plans are the same. My favorite feature is the addition of doggie daycare for as many days as you'd like and there's a discount for daycare when boarding!  pups get a bath on their last day which is great when I take them home, happy, clean and worn out from daycare fun! Highly recommended :)",5
9865,"I usually go to this store every 3 months for hair supplies, I had encounter one of their associates, she's the older lady, I'm not sure if she is white but she's light skinned. Short hair. She had horrible customer service. I brushed it off. Then last night there she is again, I am waiting to be checked out while she is standing there looking at another employee show another customer some merchandise. In my head I'm like should I tell her to check me out, I don't want to sound rude. Then she looks at me and tells me, ""do you need help?"" I answered ""yes I am waiting to be checked out"" then she says ""that means you haven't been helped therefore the answer would be yes"" but she said this in a very sarcastic way. Omg after that I was so upset, I am a customer not your friend daughter etc. you don't talk like that to customers. Then I had a coupon for renewing my membership, I gave her the code, she looked at me and told me ""that's not it"", I gave it to her again and again the same thing. I told her "" I have it right here that is the number"" she just acted like she didn't care then another employee comes and shows here what she was doing wrong and she didn't even apologize for acting like I was stupid. Honestly I'm totally disappointed, they won't be seeing me there anymore.",1
9868,"Was shopping in the plaza this place is located and decided to stop in, because you can never go wrong with burger. Ordered a BBQ bacon cheeseburger and a small chocolate malted milk ball malt. Damn, the burger was really good. There is nothing worse than a BBQ burger where they get skimpy on the sauce and this one definitely doesn't do that. The malt was pretty damn good too, but I couldn't finish it, the burger was inhaled in record time. Check this place out if you get the chance.",5
9869,"LOVE is an amazing show that transports you across time through music.  The whole performance is set to Beatles hits and is extremely well put together.  There are thousands of reviews that state why you should go to this show - I agree that this is a must see!

The mid-sized auditorium offers great views for every angle.  We scored half price tickets during a M-Life promotion so were able to sit front row for $80 each.  This gave us a great vantage to really see the emotion on the performers faces.  The performers would interact with us and my wife even was given a rose by the star during the bows. The music is well choreographed and the speakers are bumping!  I have never been in a room with so much energy!

There are many Cirque du Soliel shows in Vegas - but this one stands out among the rest!",5
9870,"I was surprised to see that I have never reviewed Nino's! My family has been coming here for a long, long time. It's fabulous. The atmosphere is very quaint and intimate. We were most recently here last night with another couple. We shared the appetizer special of fried zucchini and eggplant. It was perfectly cooked and not greasy. I tend to order the eggplant Parmesan with a meatball on the side because I can never choose between the best meatballs I've had since my Nonna passed, or the best eggplant Parmesan in the state. 

The eggplant Parmesan is actual eggplant - not too thinly sliced that all you taste is breading, and not too thick that you can't bite through the skin. It's perfect.  

Yes, portions are huge. It's run by an Italian family. Have you ever been to dinner hosted by an Italian family? It's just like that.",5
9871,"Your job as a server, has its ups and downs. I totally understand. That does NOT give you the right to be rude with your customers. 

Don't EVER, go to your table and tell them,     ""If you guys want, I'll be more than happy to get you another server"". First off, we never asked for another server. All we said was, please don't walk away so fast, when we are trying to order more food/drinks, or need the most basic thing- silverware. And you got upset or butt hurt that we had any feed back to your horrible service. Because it was that-  Horrible! Don't put your finger up to tell us ""one minute"" and not even make eye contact with your customers. We are paying to eat here, you are getting PAID. See the difference? Also, take into account that it's how you say something and not what you say. You could have said ""I'll be right with you guys, bare with me"". At least give acknowledgement that you know we are here and need/want something. 

It's busy, you're running around, all understandable. We've been there, but you apologize and move on. DO NOT give us attitude because you hate your job. If you can't deal with customers, I suggest you get into a different career. Service is simply not for you!
 
Server we had: Tall, red head. Tatted with 1991 on his arm. Never got his name. I guess introducing yourself to customers was not taught. Unfortunate.",1
9872,"Awesome place for lunch. Their systems were down so they were only taking cash but they we're still so organized and the food came out fast and delicious!! We got 2 chicken avocado sandwiches and one side of their kettle chips which was all so yummy!! At the end of our meal, the owner came to our table to clear our plates and brought us out a fresh batch of kettle chips still hot from the fryer  to go just because he was friendly!! I will definitely be coming back and bring others to try this gem!",5
9873,"Three days after moving to Henderson, one of my tires had a flat. Luckily, it happened two blocks away from this location.
Omar and the rest of the staff of Superior Tire were great! I was a walk-in, so I did have to wait, but they told me that up front, and made it within the time frame I was quoted.
Clean store, nice folks, and they didn't charge me to repair the tire!",5
9874,"I ate here this past weekend with a bunch of friends.  While everyone ordered something entirely different, I ordered the Brick roasted chicken.  This was the tastiest chicken I've ate in a long time.  It was cooked to perfection, slathered with herbs, the right amount of garlic flavor and bursting with flavor in every bite.  There was a small side of greens, I think watercress or arugula in a citrus flavored dressing and duck fried potatoes... Yeah, fried in duck fat!  

The service was great and the server was very attentive.  The dim lighting set a great ambiance for a good casual dinner with friends, dinner before clubbing or for a date.  It is more on the pricier side, but worth it.  

Do notice the placemats... they stuck in my head. :-)",5
9875,"Today was my first experience with the Minute Clinic at CVS on Chandler Blvd.  I went to the minute clinic based on a recommendation from my co-worker (after I confirmed it was an in-network provider through my insurance).  To start,  I did not have to wait longer than it took for me to fill out my information on the computer.  The NP listened to what I told her, she did a quick (but thorough) health history, and after a quick check to confirm the diagnosis-I was on my way.  My prescription was sent electronically to my pharmacy, got my printed instructions, and that was it!! 

I would highly recommend this fast alternative for anyone who, like myself, does not have time to schedule (and keep) an appointment with the doctor, especially for something simple (i.e. sinus infection).   It was so convenient and fast.  The NP was knowledgeable and very nice; she even gave me a recommendation to a specialist.  I will be returning for my flu shot in a couple of weeks.",5
9876,Amazing food with great service. We felt like we were eating dinner at the Lee household as Mr & Mrs Lee served up complimentary soup to start off the meal. Dumplings were fantastic and you could tell they were handmade from pastry to filling. Will definitely come back to this place again.,5
9877,"While in town for a job interview I stopped to look at these apartments.  First of all, they are on the pricey side but I think they're worth it.  They look like miniature homes with beautiful new appliances and heavy-duty (not cheap) granite countertops.  The kitchen in both 1 and 2 beds is huge with a very nice island.  All the amenities are gorgeous, and they even have valet trash!  Amber in the leasing office went above and beyond while taking me on a tour.  She notated every cost/fee and explained what they were, even showed me a water bill to help me get an idea of an average monthly budget.  She spent so much time with me, really selling the property well without being pushy or overbearing, just very informative.  This community might be a touch out of my budget but it's still in the running all thanks to Amber and her amazing customer service skills.  Just A+++ service all around, very impressed with the community and it's property managers so far.  If you got the dough, go for it!",5
9878,Ashley is such a perfectionist . She does beautiful work and is very creative. I highly recommend going to her for hair and makeup.,5
9880,"Never been to a Tommy Bahamas before.  This place was delicious!  The service was great - live music, great drinks, delicious food.  I wish there was one near me in Mission Viejo.  I thought Tommy Bahamas was only a clothing store!  Very cool to find this place while visiting Scottsdale - will definitely keep it on my list of likes when we are in the area again.  Give it a try for sure!",5
9883,Great food .so yummy .each plate  has a good potion of portion witch you can share easily . Definitely will  recommend it to others .....,5
9885,"I can't rave enough about how much we enjoyed our stay at Stone Gables!  This is a little gem in Ohio City!  Richard was a welcoming and attentive host!  I stayed in the ""red room"" which was decorated beautifully and very clean and comfy!  Our breakfast was outstanding!  We would stay here again...also, the B&B is walking distance to the West Side Market!",5
9886,"Pain in the Pipe was the subcontractor for a Lowe's same day water heater replacement. Scheduled arrival time at Lowe's was 6 pm. They called at 10 mins to six, and offered to do it 300$ above the Lowe's quoted price. If you have a Lowe's installed water heater, ask NOT to have Pain in the Pipe Plumbing as your subcontractor.",1
9887,"I can't say enough about these guys. I called to have my company carpets cleaned and they were very accommodating in getting my job scheduled. They showed up on time (early) and were extremely professional and courteous. You're probably asking; ""Does that really matter? I just need my carpets cleaned."" The answer is a big fat ""YES""!  It matters after you have experienced what we have from carpet cleaners over the last ten years. 

Most of all, my carpets look AWESOME and F&F's pricing is competitive. I know I have finally found a carpet cleaner.",5
9888,"The service from Serv Pro was outstanding. After water damage in my house occurred this summer, the team of Serv Pro specialists arrived prepared. They were like a team of superheroes. They were focused, precise and coordinated. Every person was courteous and skilled. I felt comfortable from the movement they entered the property. They immediately knew their positions and jumped into action. The use of technology to accurately asses the damage and document to procedures was well executed. The communication throughout the process was impeccable.",5
9889,"Walked in... Went over by the ""service area"", some old white haired  (not the tall one, the shorter. The taller one was being awesome and helping a lady out) dude with a southern drawl asked if he could help me, I told him that I wanted my Hayward cleaner rebuilt, he informed me that there was one service ahead of me and ""people milling about the store"" and he could ""maybe get to it today"". Then I heard him take a phone call, he was flat rude and told the person ""I can't see the website, I can't tell you if we carry what they are showing you or not"". Rude... I walked out.  Please give these store back to Shasta Pool so we can get prompt courteous service like we used to.
Guess you don't need my Hayward repair, new hose, and gasket sale, I'll take my $300 somewhere else.",1
9890,So.... I went with a friend to check this place out and it was GREAT!!!! We dealt with Holly (who is the best!!!!) the entire time. We came in just to take a look and she ended up signing a lease... Which clearly shows how great the customer service is. We got all the information we needed and looked a floor plans. Holly is an amazing multi-tasker. She assisted while also helping others who walked in. I am sure that my friend will love this place!!!,5
9891,"Fantastic! I always wished for a cajun-style seafood boil in Cleveland, so you can imagine how excited I was when I heard about this place! The seafood is fresh, the sauce (homemade juicy) is delicious, and the service is very quick.",5
9892,"Aggressive driving behaviour by cab 1339 on Thursday June 22nd, at 10:40pm on Parkside. The driver keeps honking at the cars  in front and repeatedly try to pass on a one-lane street. The car almost hit us and continue to drive recklessly north towards Bloor.  Management of Royal taxi should look into this driver history and behavior.  This is why Uber wins.",1
9894,"Our shuttle driver recommended this great little place and we are thrilled that he did!  We had just returned from a cross-country flight and didn't feel like getting in our car and sitting even more, so we walked from our hotel (Best Western) and after a moment of confusion (the signage in the back wasn't easily visible), found this wonderful restaurant!  Every single person in the restaurant was cheerful and helpful, and one of the ladies recommended a Hawaiian Sun beverage... OMG!  The Lilikoi Passion Fruit is like heaven in a can.  We got the bento boxes and ate Every. Single. Thing.  Simply delicious.  Oh, btw, you must give them a tip because they will do a little song for you!  Delightful!",5
9895,"I recently planned a Bachelor Party in Las Vegas, and calling Tony with Trenz was one of the first things I did.  Tony was very helpful and made our first night in Vegas an amazing experience.  He arranged VIP entrance to a few clubs, and provided a huge limo.  We were very comfortable and well taken care of the entire night.  Not to mention an open bar at the nightclub which paid for the trip itself.  I would highly recommend TRENZ to anyone who needs a great time out in Vegas, with little to worry about.  Planning the night with Tony was easy!  He didn't pressure me into anything, and we emailed back and forth several times, and spoke on the phone several times before I committed.  Great times!!!",5
9896,Armor-Kote Garage Floors was excellent all the way around.  Shane moved some other projects around to get mine prioritized and the crew did an excellent job.  It was done in less than 8 hours and it turned out awesome.  I would definitely recommend Armor-Kote to anyone.,5

9899,"My son intruduced me to this culinary wonder and can't thank him enough.
I have loved Teriyaki chicken for quite a few years now, but let me tell you that Luu's Chicken Bowl has the BEST teriyaki chicken I have ever tried!! The serving size is more than enough to please anyone and costs only $4.39. The owners (who are also the cooks) are extremely friendly people and keep the place super clean and everything is fresh, they even make their own egg rolls!!

This restaurant (which also has a drive-thru) is a hidden treasure!! they have the best miso soup also. It's a shame too many people don't know about this place, because if they did, they would never eat teriyaki chicken at any other restaurant.
They have other delicious dishes too, and have a variety of things on the menu for you vegans out there.
 
I have eaten this type of food at fancy, more expensive places and Luu's beats them all hands down.
They are the best and highly recommend you try them once...I know you'll become a steady customer like I did.

No matter where you live in the valley, it's very much worth the drive.",5
9900,"I am a huge fan of the show, so I thought it would be fun to go and check them out and buy some silver.

As soon as we got there, two freaking huge tour busses dropped of a ton of people and formed a line in front if the store.

I watched as the door man wasn't letting anyone inside. Since it was over 100 degrees and I didn't want to fall out, I went up and talked to him.

The door man was nice and I told him I wasn't with the group. He told me he understood, but they were closed for taping. I asked how long would they be closed and he said an hour to an hour and a half!

You kidding?!? Closed for taping?!? I hopped in a cab and left.",1

Justin took care of us. Great service.",5
9909,Horrible! Don't go to this place... with the new owners they probably changed chefs as well. They suck big time! Mochi was ice frozen... when we complained about the quality of sushi & how hard the Mochi was they didn't care. Horrible! Stay away from this sushi joint!,1

9915,"Nancy makes hair dreams a reality.

First, she's honest and realistic. She'll consult with you and really listen. 
She has the experience to anticipate likely/realistic outcomes.

What I also appreciate about her is that she doesn't do unnecessary work. If I don't need more highlights, she tells me so.

She has a great eye for knowing what will look good with my particular hair type, the current health of my hair, and the way I need my hair to work for my lifestyle.

She always gives me a fresh, stylish look, that is do-able for me to replicate at home. 

Oh! Most importantly she has the skill set to lighten very-dark hair with no brassiness! That skill set alone is rare!

I prefer working with Nancy over years of high end San Francisco stylists. Plus she's a kind, funny person and gives a great scalp massage.

Nancy is stylist-perfection. I'd give her ten stars if I could.",5

Not to mention the occasional rock-star mentality of some of these people....Not Here!!   They are soooooo nice and sooooo talented, truly ARTISTS!!!  They will guide you with your tattoo, sketching and advice on how to "" wear"" it. Give them a try and you won't be disappointed.  Remember:  Good tattoos aren't cheap and cheap tattoos aren't good.",5
9924,"Terrible! I bought a groupon a while back & was sooo disappointed! First the lady that cut hair was awkward & unprofessional. She had the roughest hands with my hair & kept getting me behind the ear with the comb. The groupon was for cut & style but she acted like she was done after the cut so I had to remind her of the style. She definitely didn't want to do it because she half assed blow dried my hair & when I asked for nice loose relaxed curls, she briefly went over with a straightener & added a couple curls here & there. It was frizzy & a mess. I went home & fixed it myself. 

I'm not one to be dramatic about hair. When I go for a haircut, I usually say just a trim but go with what you feel. I get tired of the same thing again & again. But this place was terrible. 

Pretty sure the 5star reviews on here are from the employees there themselves. Reviewing this place is their only review & there's no way anyone got 5star service from here.",1
9925,"Look I went to these guys two years ago. I was searching for a place to get back in shape and get motivated about my health. I met with Alex, a personal trainer at Core. He showed me some simple thing so could do that will not hurt me or bring further stress into my life. 2 years later, it took me that long yes, part of it was all negativity from failed workouts beforehand. It's been two weeks and I love the boot camp I'm in. I'm doing things that I thought I wouldn't be able to do otherwise, being ex collegiate athlete in the football arena. Seriously though, if you're looking for the
place to get started the right way and learn how to exercise and like it or if you need to find your inner athlete...you just found the place. 5 star and thanks core fitness.",5
9927,"Until my vacation earlier this month, I hadn't flown in years.  After (most of) the stress of planning ten days away had passed, I moved on to researching my parking options.  I found that off-site parking lots were not much cheaper than the long-term parking directly at the airport.  I debated, thinking that if I went off-site that would at least mean I was guaranteed a spot and wouldn't have to drive around the airport lots.  Then I found a sweet deal online for Globe (through way.com).  The total for ten days was around $45, a deal that sounded too good to be true.  My next step was to see if I could find any reviews for Globe Parking online.  Thanks to the awesome reviews here from my fellow Yelpers, I did not hesitate a minute longer and booked my space.

The day of my very early morning flight, I drove to Globe where I found several other people also arriving.  I quickly checked in and got my ticket and information on contacting them for when I return.  I had no idea what to expect and was surprised to find several employees working, checking people in and loading bags on to the shuttle van.  Did I mention this was at 3am?  

It's about a ten minute ride from Globe to the airport.  My drop-off driver was friendly and my handshake somehow even turned into a hug.  They're so fast and efficient, I was there and in line before the kiosks to check-in for flights were even open.  

The only hiccup I encountered was in returning home.  I tried to call for pick up but their line was busy on several attempts.  I finally got through and waited about 15 minutes (which I expected) for pick-up from the airport along with a few other Globe patrons.  Upon returning to the lot, I overheard that they were having issues with their phones and internet which they were actively trying to remedy.  I couldn't fault them for that, it happens.  

Once I checked out (since I used the online deal, I had already paid ahead making check out easier), I was told to keep the info on way.com for next time.  The whole experience was better than I expected from beginning to end.  Great and friendly customer service from a company that knows their business.  They even offer car washes, detailing and a few other services that can be done while you're away.  I highly recommend Globe Parking to anyone looking for extended airport parking.",5
9928,"In town for a convention, but don't want to eat on the strip.  This place rocks.  Came here for breakfast two days and want disappointed.  Substituted tuna for the filet mignon on the cluck moo , Cinnutella was incredible. Wake n  bake and  fresh morning were delicious and huge. Wish I would have found this sooner in the Vaca",5
9929,I had a out of pocket repair and the final bill came in $500 under the quoted price. Wow!!!! Metropolitan is a great shop with the best customer service in town. They price match and are a class A shop. Quick turn around and a great product!!!! I am now a customer for life.,5

9938,"I think I was just discriminated against! This pharmacy refused to fill my prescription ( I have filled there seven plus times) saying the prescription was not written on security paper. They treated me like I was less than, or lying. I'm so shaken up, I strongly suggest you take your business elsewhere. It's not like I'm filling anything out of the ordinary. I'm positive they just violated my rights.",1

9941,"This nail place is fantastic. Everyone is very nice and polite. The massage chairs are some of the best in the city.. Far better than the more expensive places around. 
They try their best to really take care of you and keep you happy. 
The pedicures and the employees bring me back!",5
9943,We stopped by after the Suns game for some drinks. DeAnna was an amazing waitress for us and so we'll definitely be back!,5
9945,"I have to say I've heard endless things about Sugar Factory, usually about the cool drinks. Last night I went there for the first time ever and it will absolutely be the last time I go there. A friend of mine had complained about a food item he ordered which the menu clearly states is TWO veggie patties. Not only did it get served incorrectly, but then on top of it when my friend had vocalized his concern to our waiter, he then proceeded to get the manager. Now I have been a manager for a company for four + years, and I have to say the way this manager not only approached our table (which he had his hand on our empty chair and was slouching) and then instead of introducing himself and asking how our meal was he said ""Whats wrong with your food?"" REALLY? I honestly was dumb founded. After a few minutes of his bantering with my friend (who granted yes he was getting upset) But on top of it the manager said they had been changing their menus and and the menu did state that it came with TWO patties, but then when we asked to have what the menu stated he claimed his chef ""would not allow that,"" which makes NO sense. Then he proceeds to tell my friend that sarcasm will get him nowhere.... I'm sorry, my friend was not being sarcastic, I then put my opinion on the table and reexplained what my friend had said he then stated all he could offer was 50% off the meal. Okay, so let me get this right... instead of just letting the two people who want an extra veggie patty like your menu clearly states (which is probably $2) you then instead say you will give them 50% off their meal? Makes no sense, they just want what they ordered. Then not only that, but religiously through our entire meal, the manager was gossiping to all the other waiters and waitress' who kept staring at us. Then our waiter also went to another waitress and started gossiping. This was BY FAR thee worst experiences I've ever had- being in management I am IMMENSELY disgusted by this managers behavior and I will do everything in my power to make sure it is known. All this manager had to do was approach our table and say, ""I'm sorry, I heard you had inquiry about your menu choice, I've very sorry for the inconvenience, but we are in the middle of changing our menu, and I am aware it does say two patties, but at this time I cannot give you two patties, however we can make you a different meal if you like or you can pay the extra for another patty, and furthermore I am very sorry for the inconvenience."" BUT no... he was the most rude, abrupt and inconsiderate manager I've ever met. My bill alone with my friend was $50 and that wasn't including my three other friends bill, we didn't tip the waiter and I will NEVER, EVER go back here again.",1
9946,"Friendly, fast, clean. Got the grilled chicken curry with brown rice level 8. Soo yummy!",5
9947,"Excellent service, our haircuts turned out way better than what we wanted. They pay a lot of attention to detail. My boyfriend and I both had our hair cut here. We were able to book our haircuts on the same day, and have our hair cut at the same time. I am definetly recommending friends and family to come here.",5
9948,"Pass up this one.

This small Starbucks stand is located inside a Safeway supermarket with zero ambiance and a generally unfriendly staff.  Also, I've been there on more than occasion when the Starbucks chain was offering a special pricing promotion -- but this place would not honor the promotion saying "" Oh, we're not doing that promotion.""

What kind of deal is that?  I often get the impression this Starbucks is little more than an after-thought.  Pass this one up.  There is a larger, more pleasant one in the nearby Fry's supermarket on Yuma Road that does honor the promotions (if you have a Fry's card). And of course there are lots of other Starbucks or Dutch Bros.",1
9950,"This simple looking grocery/restaurant is run by the same person who worked the yummy wood-fired pizza oven at Norman Hardie Estate out in Prince Edward County. We have been to his restaurant twice on the recommendation of the winery itself, and both times it was pizza and Norman Hardie wines. This pizza is my favourite in the city, and is the same style as Libretto - thin, scorched crust and simple, delicious toppings. The crust recipe is very important to this style of pie, and it is excellent here. Do not let the basic layout of the space fool you. This is excellent food!",5
9952,"I've eaten and ordered take out from Senbazuru for years and I've vowed to never go there again after this last time. For a while now, I've noticed the service deteriorate especially from one waitress in particular. As a non-Asian patron, there is a noticeable difference in treatment received. The service has gotten to a point of downright rudeness, with plates being slid across the table rather than placed. Not to mention plates and glasses are not washed well and noticeably dirty. This last time we walked into an empty restaurant and we were told to sit anywhere we liked. Only after we received our drinks and a party of 10 people (no reservations) arrived, we were asked to move. Normally, I have no problem with that but there was plenty of room in the restaurant to accommodate the group size, however, they wanted to sit together in the area where we were. Of course being of Asian descent, the request had to be accommodated. To summarize, with a influx of sushi restaurants in the area, there is no reason to frequent this place. Food is mediocre, the place and dishes are dirty and the service, as I've mentioned is completely disgusting.",1
9953,"Tim was very helpful but the company he suggested to me Haggert Home Improvements left a hole between the rad pipes, laid tile that squeeked and shifted after it was laid. Also if ever considering Haggert Home Improvements do not pay by the hour. When I called Tile City hoping to get some support it was clear that this wasn't going to happen even though the person I spoke with agreed when I sent photos to the store that the job was not done correctly.",1
9956,"Since I go to OCAD, I frequent this place pretty often. I usually get the kake udon (which is the cheapest udon dish and comes with just four pieces of fish cake) for just over $4 or the beef niku udon for a couple dollars more. The soup is addictive and the dish is simple and filling. You can make any dish into a combo for another $2 and have a choice of two out of three items: takosen, soup, or salad. (They say they also have chips available on the menu but every time I've asked they don't have it so I've given up.) Takosen are a good pick for combos as you get two takoyaki (a popular Japanese snack made of batter balls with a piece of octopus inside) sandwiched between two rice crackers. 
This place is such a great deal and the food is amazing for the price. I'm not Japanese so I can't say how authentic the food is but it certainly feels healthier to eat here than some of the other places in the Grange. Also, it's nice to have a proper sit-down restaurant with non-disposable chopsticks and clean tables. I have booked the place for large groups before (10+ ppl). The hours are sometimes a bit odd as some days they close later than others and they usually open at 11:30 am (and sometimes they are late to open) but booking solves the problem if there is one. Also, even though it's Japanese, don't expect sushi here. The main pull is udon.",5
9957,"Probably the most real food I've had in Vegas.  Generous portions, hearty food, great price.  There's always a line, though, so be ready for a wait.  (It's worth it!)
Oh, and get the house's special garlic rice, it's fantastic!",5
9958,"I would like to say, I am the most terrified of dentists! I had to go because I had a throbbing pain for months that became unbearable. So I googled and reviewed several dentists and this one stood out. First it was their hours which fit my work schedule, then it was the reviews. I was SO nervous when I got there but the warmth I felt from Karla eased me a little! Still nervous, Karla walked with me down the hall of doom where I met Dr. Amy, and she was so kind and empathetic to my panicky demeanor! I had 2 teeth pulled, yikes! But she almost had me so calm that I was actually ok! She talks to you to make you feel comfortable and that you're in good hands; she also called me to check on me afterwards, kudos for that; would I return? If it was up to me NO! But Dr. Amy and Karla said I have to and I trust them now! I still have some fears, but at least there, I don't fear the people!",5

9961,6 month waiting period for an x-ray???? Right.... So the monthly premium over a 6 month period can pay for itself! Total scam. Glad it was only a free trial. Upset it doesn't do anything...,1
9962,"I've suffered several injuries as a result of a few car accidents. As a result, I had constant pain in my shoulders, neck and back that often turned into migraine headaches making it nearly impossible to function. I went to my regular PCP and all he did was prescribe me pills. The pills helped with the pain a little, but they caused other side effects that I didn't particularly like. So the doctor started prescribing me more pills for the side effects caused by the first set of pills. At that point, I decided I was tired of masking the pain and wanted a ""real fix"", not a drug induced ""fix"". That's when I started looking into chiropractic care.

After going through some good and some not so good chiropractors, I finally met Dr. Reed at a Home Improvement Show in Phoenix. I was attracted to his booth with his fancy system for determining where the back problems are. After talking with him, I was happy to find out his office was really close to my office, so I set up an adjustment for the following week.

When I went to the office, I was thoroughly impressed with the professionalism, honesty and skill that Dr. Reed and his staff exhibited. There was no high pressure sales pitch. The exam was thorough before an adjustment was made. And the cost without insurance was totally affordable!

Even though I have since moved jobs and their office isn't as convenient, I still go out of my way to see Dr. Reed on a regular basis (every 2 weeks). Ever since I started a regular maintenance plan, I have not had a single migraine. Sure, I still get a few nagging pains here and there, but they are nowhere as debilitating as before and I can get in quickly to see Dr. Reed and all is well again! :)",5
9963,"I HATE THIS PLACE!!! I had the worst experience! I have a regular stylist who went back home to Chicago for the summer. I was approached about this salon and their new location. I called, explained my hair type and style and asked who would be best to serve me. The receptionist advised me which stylist would be best, and I booked the appointment. I showed up 10 minutes early. The stylist I was told would be styling that day, rudely informed me she was a level 5 stylist with a full client list and any stylist in the salon could do a good job. I should have walked out then, but I didn't. I told myself, ""let's give the stylist a chance."" I came in with my hair done as I always wear it, I explained exactly what I needed and wanted as well as showed the stylist pictures. I left in tears, she BUTCHERED my hair!! I was VERY disappointed, I will never step foot in that salon ever again! I wouldn't wish that experience on anyone! :(

I have been to different hair salons trying to find a stylist that fits me. I was hoping to finally end this long search. This is why despite my initial interaction, I decided to give the younger stylist a chance. I honestly, was hoping to find someone I could rely on regularly. My current stylist is always in and out of town. She has done this for many years and this is no longer a job to her its hobby so she's not always available.

This was a complete disaster, I left in tears and cried for 3 hours. I had to go to Fantastic Sam's near my home to help clean up the mess the stylist left me with. I wear a sassy short hair cut but not a MULLLET! With the extensive explaining, and pictures I for sure thought I would leave at the least satisfied or with something I could work with! I cannot do anything but wait for this disaster to grow out. I am devistated, and I would think twice, three, even four times before you take a risk at this salon. I will say this, the salon lay out is nice, and the atomosphere is upbeat however, the skills ARE JUST NOT THERE!!!",1
9964,"Ok, if I give this place a great review, can the rest of Vegas please not come here?!??! I literally drive across town to go to this urgent care because it's the best one in Vegas in my opinion. However, DON'T TELL ANYONE!! 

If you check in online, they will literally call you and tell you what time to show up. I have never sat in the waiting room for more than ten minutes. Furthermore, this place is so clean compared to some of the other crackhead urgent cares in town. Every doctor I've dealt with here has been fantastic too. My husband refuses to listen to me and he goes to the urgent care near our house. Over there, he sits around for two plus hours and has a bunch of weirdos to deal with in a subpar waiting room lurking with germs and contagion. Meanwhile, I'm in and out of this place and have my RX filled at CVS in less than an hour for all of it. Hands down - best urgent care in Vegas!",5

I will definitely be back!",5

The hot sauce is to die for. Finally a hot sauce that will make your eyes water while still having a delicious almost smoky flavor. I can't wait to come back and try more. Maybe the sopes, tacodilla or macho fries?",5
9976,"Paletas Betty where have you been all my life ! We came in for the strawberries and cream but walked out with strawberries and cream, coconut, mango, pineapple, chile pineapple, and pecan.

There's bits of fruit every morsel of popsicle no matter what flavor you choose !",5
9978,"I found this place on yelp and saw great ratings. Walked in and loved the ambiance and the waiter seemed very sweet but the time the manager/owner(short asian guy) walks in to help, he ruins the whole mood. I have never met someone with such bad energy. I looked at the menu and asked him if they have more snacks and his response ""you need to go to a restaurant if you wanna eat"". We planned to spend a great amount of time and try every drinks on the menu but unfortunately, he ruined it and we had to leave. I am sure this place got great ratings because of the other servers. 
Guys,if u need great drinks with great service, stop by The coldroom. The drinks are awesome and people working there are awesome too! You won't regret.
To this manager/owner, you have got horrible reviews from so many people. You need to stay home and hire someone else. What a JERK!",1

9986,"Quite some time ago I saw this place on Travel Channel's top 50 unique places to eat, or something like that. The idea of a fusion of Oriental and Mexican food intrigued me. knowing that I would not be going to Phoenix any time soon, I put it in the back of my mind.

Ended up in Phoenix on business and needed to find a place to eat. The back of my mind reminded me of some place with Mexican/Oriental fusion. searched Yelp and came up with Chino Bandido and it was only 4 miles from my hotel.

I wanted to experience as many flavors as possible so I ordered an al la cart carnitas burrito & a combination bowl with Jade chicken, chile relleno, jerk chicken fried rice and Cuban black beans. I wish I could have ordered more, but the portion sizes are too big and I would have been miserable, because I would have eaten every bite. The chile relleno was fantastic. the crispy exterior was so unique.

WOW! the flavors exploded in my mouth. The food was great!

The thing that impressed me more than the food was the service. If any one wants an example of  great customer service for a model for their own business after, even without eating a bite of the delicious food a visit to Chino Bandido is would be worth the trip. The staff's compensation is either based on the the satisfaction of the clientele of they are part owners, because everyone of them acted as if it was their business. It was my first visit and I did not know the menu or how to order. No problem. I was greeted by friendly staff who directed me to a line of neophytes. when it was my turn the young lady asked me  some questions and then offered bites of different menu items & explained some of the many options available for me to order. I even had to ask her to cut down the size of the samples so that I would not fill up before ordering.

My only regret is not being able to go back and order some of the menu items I was unable to try.

The 4"" snicker-doodle cookie was a very pleasant surprise.",5
9988,"I always come to this loft when visiting Vegas. .Today I came in with the intent to spend $50 to get the loft cash card. The customer service I received from the young female manager today definitely makes this my favorite loft. . I walked in,  she greeted me and explained the specials in the store today and if i made a $50 purchase I'll receive two $25 loft cash cards to use for a future purchase in June. I told her that i just came from the loft in Greenvalley but they only have me 1 $25 loft cash card. . She asked to see my receipt and gave me another $25 loft can card and corrected my receipt.  She checked on me periodically to see if she could assist me. .I was intent on only spending $50 to get cash cards,  and she helped me to calculate and to find the color and sizes I needed.  She was always so happy to assist,  I'm glad I came here today.  I'll be back on June 1 to spend my loft cash cards.",5

I have gotten in trouble and I have a felony but it's the lowest one and it's not for anything violent or sexual. This place stated they do not discriminate against that and it is not a disqualification for having one. Yet I was told I did not pass the background check. I have 9 years with Motorola and 13 years with the sheriffs dpt. So I know the only thing in my background is the felony. It's a shame this corporation does not believe in 2nd chances and they could even receive a tax break for hiring me too. I wish someone would believe in second chances, my family needs me more then ever",1

I then changed rooms again to one that was finally quite.  Of the 4 or 5 staff members I spoke with most could care less and simply said ""they weren't supposed to make noise until 9:00 AM"".  I also had a few bug bites on me from my stay which makes me a bit worried. 

Also, there were resort fees in the fine print of my resrvation and even though mine said the fitness center was included in the resort fees, they told me that was a mistake and would not honor it.

My only positive was the pool was decent.  I still would never stay there again.",1

Wonderful spiciness of the sauce and mellow tartness of castelvetrano olives (I think) - paired with the La Meirana Gavi. I could have eaten just this for dinner, but there was more to come. The fileto de manza with the brandy cream reduction was amazing especially with the 2013 Alves de Sousa Douro Rsv. Thank you Chef, and your staff for a memorable evening.",5
